1
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,400
Black cats and goblins and broomsticks and ghosts.

2
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,000
Pumpkins of witches are there to roast.

3
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,500
You may think, they scare me. You're probably right.

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Black cats and goblins on Halloween night.

5
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,200
Trick or treat!

6
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,400
My parents won't be home untill ten.
- Are you sure?

7
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,600
We're all alone, aren't we?

8
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,400
Michael's around someplace ...

9
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Take off that thing.

10
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's go upstairs.
- Ok.

11
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,100
Look, Judith, it's very late.

12
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,400
I gotta go.

13
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Will you call me tomorrow?

14
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Yeah, sure.
- Promise?

15
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
Yeah.

16
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,800
Michael?

17
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,100
Michael?

18
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,900
Ever done anything like this before?

19
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,000
Only minimum security.

20
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
I see.

21
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,300
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on the right.

22
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
The only thing that ever bothers me is their jibberish.

23
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,900
When they start raving on and on ...

24
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,600
You haven't anything to worry about.

25
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,400
He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.

26
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,100
Are there any special instructions?

27
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,500
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here.

28
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,600
Don't underestimate it.

29
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Don't you think we could refer to 'it' as him?

30
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,100
If you say so.

31
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,800
Your compassion's overwhelming, Doctor.

32
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,600
What do I give him,
when we're taking him in front of the judge?

33
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,600
Thorazin.

34
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,600
Barely be able to sit up.
- That's the idea.

35
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,500
You're serious about that, aren't you?

36
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,900
Yeah.

37
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
You mean, you actually never want him to get out.
- Never ever ...

38
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,000
Never.

39
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,500
Then why we're taking up to Hardy county,
if he just gonna ... - Because that is the law.

40
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,300
We are.

41
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,200
Since when do they let them wander around?

42
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,000
Pull up to the main gate.
- Shouldn't we ... - Pull up?

43
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,900
Stop here.

44
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital on ...
- Wait!

45
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,900
Are you all right?

46
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,600
You all right?
- Yes, I'm ok. - He's gone. He's gone?

47
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
The evil is gone!

48
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,700
I gotta ...

49
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,400
Don't forget to drop the key off the Myers place ...

50
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,300
I won't.

51
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,300
They're coming by look at the house at 10:30.
Be sure you leave it under the mat ... - Promise.

52
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Laurie ...

53
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,100
Hi Tommy.

54
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,400
Coming over tonight?
- Same time, same place.

55
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
- Sure.

56
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,600
And watch the monster movies?
- Sure.

57
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,900
Will you read to me?

58
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,000
Can we make popcorn?
- Sure, sure, sure.

59
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,100
You better hurry up.

60
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,900
How can you walk in the school this way?
- My dad asked me to.

61
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,100
Why?

62
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,500
I have to drop off the key.

63
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,600
Why?

64
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,100
Because he's gonna sell a house.

65
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,300
Why?

66
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,400
Because that's his job.
- Where?

67
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
The Meyers house.

68
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,500
The Meyers house!

69
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,300
You're not supposed to go up there?

70
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,700
Yes, I am.

71
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,700
That's a spook house.

72
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,600
Just watch.

73
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,700
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there.

74
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,600
Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house.

75
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,500
He said real awful stuff happened there once.
- Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.

76
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,900
I gotta go.

77
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,100
I see you tonight.

78
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,000
Bye.
- Bye.

79
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,100
* I wish I had you all alone ... *

80
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,600
* Just the two of us ... *

81
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
* I would hold you close to me ... *

82
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,200
* So close to me ... *

83
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
* Just the two ... *

84
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,900
I'm not responsible, Sam. - Oh, no ...

85
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,100
I told them how dangerous he was!

86
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,800
You wouldn't have enough two roadblocks
and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!

87
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,900
But he was your patient, Doctor. If precautions
weren't strong enough, you should have told somebody.

88
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,400
I told everybody!

89
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,000
Nobody listened.
- There's nothing else I can do.

90
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,300
You can get back in there
and get back on the telephone.

91
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,400
Tell them exactly
who walked out of here last night ...

92
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,000
And tell them exactly where he is going.
- Probably going.

93
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,300
I'm wasting my time. - Sam, Haddonfield is
a hundred and fifty miles away from here.

94
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,200
Now, now for God's sake, he can't drive a car!
- He was doing very well last night!

95
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Maybe someone around here gave him lessons.

96
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,100
{Y:i}Doctor Chance, plese come to point C ...

97
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,400
{Y:i}Doctor Chance, point C please.

98
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,700
... and the book ends.

99
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,300
But what Samuels is really talking about here ...

100
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
is fate.

101
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,100
You see ...

102
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,400
fate caught up with several lives here.

103
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,400
No matter what course of action Collins took ...

104
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,100
he was destined to his own fate,

105
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,100
his own day of reckoning with himself.

106
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,500
The idea ...

107
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
is ...

108
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,500
that destiny ...

109
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,400
is a very real, concrete thing
that every person has to deal with.

110
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,400
How does Samuels' view of fate
differ from that of Costaine's? Laurie?

111
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,000
M'am?

112
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,800
Answer the question.

113
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Costaine wrote that fate 
was somehow related only to religion

114
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,800
or where Samuels felt that ... well, fate was like
a natural element, like earth, air, fire, and water.

115
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,500
That's right, Samuels definitely personified fate.

116
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,500
In Samuels' writing, fate is a moveable like a mountain.

117
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,000
It stands, where man passes a way.

118
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Fate never changes.

119
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,100
You, with pumpkin.
- Leave me alone!

120
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:56,500
He's gonna get you!
- He's gonna get you, he's gonna get you...

121
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,300
The boogeyman is coming!
- Leave me alone!

122
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,600
He doesn't believe us.
- Don't you know what happens on Halloween?

123
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,900
Yeah, we get candy.

124
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:12,700
The boogey man!
- The boogey man, the boogey man, the boogey ...

125
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,500
He's on his way.

126
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,900
You gotta believe me officer,
he is coming to Haddonfield.

127
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,400
Because I know him.

128
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him.

129
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,300
If you don't, it's your funeral.

130
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,700
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder.

131
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,100
Can't hear now, we yell a little louder.

132
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,400
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder!

133
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,900
Can't hear now ... continue
- Oh, look at you.

134
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,400
Get off the books you have.
You neeed a shopping cart to get home.

135
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,100
Heeey Haddonfield!
- Yeah, one for me.

136
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,900
You know it's totally insane!
We have three new cheers to learn in the morning,

137
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,000
the game in the afternoon, I have to get my hair
done at five and the dance is at eight.

138
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,400
 I'll be totally wiped out!

139
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,900
I don't think get enough to do tommorow.
- Totally!

140
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,600
As usual, I have nothing to do.
- It's your own fault and I don't feel bit sorry for you.

141
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Hey, Lynda, Laurie!

142
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,200
Why didn't you wait for me?

143
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,000
We did.

144
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,400
Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed.
- That's not true. Here I am.

145
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,000
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
- I'm never smiling again.

146
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,400
Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell ...
- Exploring uncharted territory?- It's been totally charted.

147
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,600
We just talked.

148
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,800
Sure, sure.

149
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,600
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs
and soaping windows. His parents grounded him.

150
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
He can't come over tonight.

151
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,400
I thought you were babysitting tonight. - The only reason
she babysits is to have a place to... - Oh shit ...

152
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I have a place for that.

153
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,100
I forgot my chemistry book.

154
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,100
So, who cares? I always forget my chemistry book
and my math book and my english book and my ...

155
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,900
and let's see my French book and ...

156
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,400
Who needs books anyway? I don't need books.
I always forget all of my books. I mean ...

157
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,700
it doesn't really matter if I you got that books or not.

158
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,100
Hey, isn't that the van Graham?

159
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,300
I don't think so.

160
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,600
I think he's cute.

161
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,400
Hey, jerk ...

162
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,100
Speed kills!

163
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Gosh ... Can't he take a joke?

164
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,700
You know, Annie, some day
you gonna get us all into deep trouble.

165
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,100
Totally.

166
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,600
I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor.

167
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Well, are we still on for tonight?

168
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

169
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh come on, Annie ...

170
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
Bob and I've been planning on it all week.

171
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,900
All right.

172
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
The Wallaces leave at seven.

173
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm babysitting the Doyles.

174
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,600
It's only three houses down. We can keep each other
company. - Ohh, terrific ... I've got three choices.

175
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,900
Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda
screw around or talk to you.

176
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,700
We're so ma ...

177
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,000
Here.

178
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,700
What time at night?

179
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my little
brother trick- or-treating. - Saving the treats for Bob?

180
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,200
Fun-ny.

181
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,400
See you.
- Bye. - Bye.

182
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,900
Annie, look.

183
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,600
Look where?

184
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,000
Behind the bush.

185
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,400
I don't see anything.
- That guy who drove by so fast, when you yelled at.

186
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,000
Subtle, isn't he?

187
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,900
Hey, creep!

188
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,200
Laurie, dear, he wants to talk to you.

189
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,500
He wants to take you out tonight.

190
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,600
He was standing right there.

191
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,300
Poor Laurie.

192
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,600
Scared another one away.

193
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,800
It's tragic. You never go out.

194
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,900
You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting
so much. - Guys think I'm too smart.

195
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,900
I don't. I think you're whacko.
Now you're seeing men behind bushes.

196
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,900
Well, home sweet home.

197
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
See you later.

198
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,400
Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,400
Excuse me, Laurie. - Oh, Mr. Brackett,
I'm sorry, Mr. Brackett. - Oh, I didn't mean to scary ya.

200
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
I'm sorry.

201
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,800
You know, it's Halloween.
I guess everybody's entitled to a one good scare.

202
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Yes, sir.

203
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,700
Nice evening, sir.

204
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,900
Trick -o - treat, Trick -o - treat.

205
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,200
Oh, kiddo ...

206
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,500
thought you grew up from superstition.

207
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,100
Hello?

208
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,900
Hello?

209
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,300
Who is this?

210
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,300
Hello?

211
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,800
{Y:i}Why did you hang up on me?

212
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
Annie?

213
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,900
Was that you?

214
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,000
{Y:i}Of course.
- Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.

215
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
{Y:i}I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?

216
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,900
I thought it was an obscene phone call.

217
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,700
{Y:i}Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
- I've already lost it.

218
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,600
{Y:i}I Doubt that.

219
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,000
{Y:i}Listen, my mother is letting me use her car.
I'll pick you up. 6:30.

220
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
{Y:i}Ok, bye.
-Bye.

221
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,500
Just calm down.

222
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,500
This is ridiculous.

223
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,800
Hurry up.

224
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,000
Just have time.

225
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,700
Judith Myers. Myers.

226
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,100
Row 18 ... plot 20.

227
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,900
Hey, you know. You know,
every town has something like this happen.

228
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,500
I remember over in Russellville.

229
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,900
Old Charly Bowles. About fifteen years ago.

230
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,800
One night he, he finished dinner ...

231
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,900
And he excused himself from the table ...

232
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,800
And he went out to the garage ...

233
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,600
He got himself a hack saw ...

234
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,600
And then he went back into the house ...

235
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,500
And he kissed his wife and two children goodbye ...

236
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,400
And then he proceeded ...
- Where are we?

237
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,600
It's right over here.

238
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Myers, Judith Myers. I remember her.

239
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,700
Couldn't believe.

240
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,400
Such a young boy.

241
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
Well, you lost?

242
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,600
Why do they do it?

243
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,400
Goddamn kids.

244
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,300
They'll do anything for Halloweens.

245
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,400
It was grave, hers.
- Oh, I know that.

246
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,800
18, 19 ...

247
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,100
Judith Myers.

248
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,000
He came home.

249
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,400
You still spooked?

250
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,000
I wasn't spooked.

251
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
Lies.
- I wasn't.

252
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,600
Saw somebody standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
- Probably Mr. Riddle.

253
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,300
He was watching me.
- Mr. Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87.

254
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,600
He can still watch.

255
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,500
That's probably all he can do.

256
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,000
What's the pumkin for? - I brought it for Tommy. I figured
carving a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.

257
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,900
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
-

258
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,600
Thanks. - And for that matter,
I might as well be a girl scout myself tonight.

259
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,100
I plan on making popcorn
and watching Doctor Demensia.

260
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,000
Six straight hours of horror movies.
Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.

261
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,900
My dad!

262
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,200
Get rid of this.

263
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,900
Laurie, stop caughing. What's the matter with you?

264
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,500
Just be natural. There he is. Just be natural, Laurie.

265
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
Hi, Annie, Laurie...

266
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,500
Hi, Dad.

267
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,000
What happened?
- What? What happened?

268
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,200
Somebody broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.

269
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,400
You blame everything on kids.

270
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,000
What all they took was some Halloween masks, a rope
and a couple of knives. Who do you think it was?

271
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,400
It's hard growing up with a cynical father.

272
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,400
Aren't you gonna be late ...
- Huh?

273
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,400
I said aren't you gonna be late.
- He shouts too.

274
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,400
Bye girls.

275
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,300
Bye dad.
- Bye.

276
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Sheriff.

277
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,700
Pardon me, I'm a Loomis. Dr. Sam Loomis.

278
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,400
Lee Brackett.
- I, I'd like to have a word with you if I could.

279
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,600
Ah, maybe a few minutes. I gotta take that
- It's just important.

280
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,100
Ten minutes.
- I'll be here.

281
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
What's the matter with you?

282
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I think he knew. I'm sure he could smell it.

283
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,300
No, he didn't.
- He did.

284
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,900
See the look on his face?

285
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,800
He always looks like that.

286
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,500
What you gonna wear on dance tommorow night?

287
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,100
I didn't know you thought about things like that, Laurie.

288
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,600
You know you could ask somebody.
- No, I couldn't.

289
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Sure you could.
All you have to do is go up to somebody and say ...

290
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,100
You wanna go to the dance?

291
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
You could do that, I couldn't.

292
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,600
Or you could ask Dick Paxter.
He could go out with ya.

293
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,100
I try to get out Ben Tramor.

294
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,500
Ben Tramor?

295
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,900
I knew it!

296
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,400
See, you do think about things like that, huh, Laurie?

297
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,400
Shut up.
- He is cute.

298
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Ben Tramor.

299
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,300
Ok.

300
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,900
Bye.

301
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:41,600
Trick or treat, trick or treat:
give me something good to eat.

302
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Hi. - Hi Annie, come on in.
- How are you doing today? - Fine. How are you?

303
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,700
What time are you in your bed?
- I'm being in bed by nine, ok.

304
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,000
Have a good night, dear.
- Be a good girl.

305
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,900
Bye bye.
- Here.

306
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,600
Anybody lives here?
- No, not since 1963 when that happened.

307
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
- They may be right.

308
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,400
Look.
- What?

309
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,100
What is that?

310
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,300
It's a dog.

311
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,800
Still warm.

312
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,500
He got hungry.

313
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,600
Could have been a skunk.

314
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,700
Could have.

315
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,600
A man wouldn't do that ...

316
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,000
This is not a man.

317
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,900
It happened in here.

318
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,900
She was sitting right here ...

319
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,600
He could have seen her thru this window.

320
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
Standing on the lawn ...

321
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,900
He could have seen in side.

322
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,900
You must think of me ...

323
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,500
the very sinister doctor.

324
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,900
I do have a permit.

325
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,500
Seems to me you're just plain scared.

326
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,400
Yes.

327
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,900
Yeah, I'm a...

328
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,700
I met him ... fifteen years ago.
I was told there was nothing left.

329
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:55,300
No reason ... nowhere conscience, no understanding
in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death of ...

330
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,800
good or evil, right or wrong.

331
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,800
I met this ...

332
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,100
six year-old child with his ...

333
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:08,100
blank, pale, emotionless face, and ...

334
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,300
the blackest eyes ...

335
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,800
the Devil's eyes.

336
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,200
I spent eight years trying to reach him ...

337
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,700
and then another seven trying to keep him locked up,
because I realized that

338
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,600
what was living behind that boy's eyes
was purely and simply...

339
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,400
... evil.

340
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
What do we do?

341
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,000
He's been here once tonight ...

342
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,900
I think he'll come back.

343
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm gonna wait for him.

344
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,100
I still think I should notify the radio and television.
- No.

345
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:43,800
If you do that, they'll see him on every street corner, they
look for him on every house. Just tell your men to keep their ...

346
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,900
mouth shut and their eyes open.

347
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,400
I'll check back in an hour.

348
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,200
... oh now, cried Arthur.

349
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,000
'Let no one pass this way without a fight!'

350
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,600
'That's so,' said the knight

351
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,900
in a bold and haughty manner.

352
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,700
I don't like that story.
- I thought king Arthur was your favorite.

353
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,200
Not anymore.

354
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,100
Why do you keep them under there?

355
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,100
Mom doesn't like me to have them.

356
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,400
'Laser Man' ...

357
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,900
'Neutron Man' ... I can understand why.

358
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,900
'Tarantula Man' ...

359
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Laurie ...

360
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,000
what's the Boogeyman?

361
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,900
Doyle residence.

362
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,600
{Y:i}It's me ...
- Hi Annie, what are you doing?

363
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,400
{Y:i}Making popcorn ...

364
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,200
Having fun ...

365
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,000
Never mind, I'm sure you are.

366
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,500
I have big, big news for you ...

367
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,700
Hold on a minute.

368
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,500
Hi Lester...

369
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm about to be ripped apart by the family dog.

370
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,900
Lindsey ... get this dog out of the kitchen right now.

371
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,000
I hate that dog ...
I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.

372
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,700
So, what is this big, big news?

373
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,900
What would you say if I told you that you were going
to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?

374
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,500
I would probably say you've got the wrong number.

375
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,800
Well ...

376
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:46,800
I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited
when I told him how attracted you were to him.

377
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh, Annie ...

378
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,900
Oh, you didn't. Please tell me you didn't.

379
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,000
How could you do that?

380
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,300
I mean how you just call him.
What do you mean it's easy?

381
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,800
I can't believe this.

382
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,700
I can't tell you anything.

383
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,200
Please tell me you didn't.

384
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,100
Oh, you didn't.

385
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,500
Laurie ... - I'm so embarrassed, I couldn't even face him.
- Boogeyman is outside.

386
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,400
Laurie ... out there.
- Hold on.

387
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,500
Laurie, the boogeyman is outside. Look!

388
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,100
Tommy, there is nobody outside.

389
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,400
Go watch TV.

390
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,100
It's just Tommy.

391
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,100
Oh, please, Annie ...

392
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,300
You could do that.

393
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,900
Look it's simple. You like him, he likes you.
All you need is a little push.

394
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,100
It won't hurt you to go out with him, for God's sake.

395
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Shit!

396
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,700
No, no, I just made a mess on myself.
I gotta call you back.

397
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,000
Oh, yuck!

398
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,500
Lindsey ...

399
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,600
I need a robe.

400
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,100
Lindsey ...

401
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,000
Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.

402
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,300
Never mind ...

403
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,400
I guess he found a hot date.

404
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,400
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
- After the movie.

405
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,400
What about the rest of my comic books?
- After the Jack-O-Lantern.

406
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,400
What about the boogeyman?

407
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,200
There is no such thing.

408
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,500
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.

409
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,400
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?

410
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,200
No.

411
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,100
Tommy, Halloween night ... 
it's when people play tricks on each other.

412
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,100
It's all make believe.
I think Richie was just trying to scare you.

413
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,100
I saw the boogeyman. I saw him outside.

414
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,900
There was nobody outside.

415
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,000
There was.
- What did he look like?

416
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,600
The boogyeman!

417
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,400
We're not getting anywhere.

418
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,000
All right.

419
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,300
The boogyeman can only come out
on Halloween night, right?

420
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,300
Right.

421
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,600
Welll, I'm here tonight.
I'm not about to let anything happen to you.

422
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,700
Promise?

423
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,200
Promise.

424
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,500
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?

425
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,900
Let's go.

426
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,100
Hmm, terrific.

427
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,500
Hello?

428
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,900
Who's there?

429
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,000
Paul, is this one of your cheap pranks?

430
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,900
Guess not.

431
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,600
No tricks for Annie tonight.

432
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,000
Lindsey!

433
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,900
Lindsey, come out here!

434
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,900
Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room! The door wouldn't open!

435
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,600
{Y:i}Spread out everybody.

436
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,000
{Y:i}We gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.

437
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,700
{Y:i}Holly cat.

438
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,500
{Y:i}Hey.
- Yeah.

439
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,800
{Y:i}Almost perfect.
What's wrong?

440
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,300
{Y:i}We finally got one.
- We found a plain sourcer.

441
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,500
Oh, Lindsey, get the phone, it's Paul.

442
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,100
Lindsey!

443
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,500
Lindseeey!

444
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,200
{Y:i}No, no answer. - Doctor, where are those fingers from?

445
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,000
{Y:i}I don't know, Mr. Scott.
Hallo?

446
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,900
{Y:i}Hi Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

447
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,200
Yes, she is.

448
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,600
{Y:i}Get her for me, will ya?

449
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,600
She's washing her clothes.

450
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,900
{Y:i}Look, just tell her it's me, ok?

451
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,500
Ok.

452
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,800
Annie, Paul called!

453
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,400
You locked yourself there.
- I know.

454
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,000
Pull my foot. I'm stuck!

455
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,900
Now promise me you won't tell anybody about this.

456
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,100
She got stuck in a window. She'll be right here.

457
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,100
{Y:i}Hello?
Hi Annie.

458
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,300
{Y:i}Oh, hi Paul.
Stuck, huh?

459
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,900
{Y:i}All right, cut it out. It can happen to anyone.
Sure ... stuck in the widow.

460
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,500
Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in plenty of other positions!

461
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,900
My parents are gone.

462
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,000
Oh that's fabulous. When did they leave?

463
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,400
About half ago
- Oh, utterly fantastic.

464
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,600
So why don't you just walk over?

465
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,200
{Y:i}You coming pick me up.
- Well, I can't come now. My clothes are in the wash.

466
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:47,000
Oh shut up jerk. Can't, I've got a shirt on.
That's all you ever think about.

467
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,700
{Y:i}I think that's all you ever think about.
- That's not true, I think about lots of things.

468
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,700
Now why don't we not stand here
talking about them and get down to doing them?

469
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:02,800
{Y:i}Lock your doors, bolt your window and turn off the lights.

470
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,600
{Y:i}Don't go away ... cause here is a scene ...
- I'm scared.

471
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,100
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?

472
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,300
I don't know.
- Well, come on get your coat.
We're going to pick up Paul.

473
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,600
I don't want to.

474
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:20,000
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
- I want to stay here and watch this.

475
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,700
Okay, if I can fix it so you can watch TV
with Tommy Doyle, would you like that?

476
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,600
Yes.
- Well, come with me.

477
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,600
Come on! Hurry up.

478
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,700
{Y:i}That strange that has to short it out.

479
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,500
Hi Tommy.

480
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,200
Hi.

481
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,500
Come on in. We're making a Jack-O-Lantern.
- You know I wanna watch TV.

482
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,700
Annie, come in here.

483
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:18,000
{Y:i}...now the horrifying conclusion ...

484
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,200
{Y:i}... to ... the them.

485
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,900
Oh, fancy.

486
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,300
This has not been my night.

487
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:34,600
I spilled butter all over. My cloths are in the wash.
I got stuck in a window. - I'd like you call Ben Tramer
and tell him you're just fooling around.

488
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,600
I can't. - Yes, you can. - No, he went drinking with
Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late.

489
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,400
YOU'LL have to call him ... tomorrow.

490
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,700
Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.

491
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,700
Wait a minute.

492
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:51,700
If you watch her,
I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.

493
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,100
Deal.

494
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,100
I thought Paul was grounded.
- He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out.

495
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,000
Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so, ok?
- Yeah.

496
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,600
Bye.

497
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,000
The old girl scout comes through again.

498
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,900
* My Paul ... I give you all *

499
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,600
* No keys, but pleeease ... *
*my Paul *

500
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,900
* Oh, Paul ... *
*I can no longer stall... *

501
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:19,000
* Oh Paul. Oh Paul ...*
*I can no longer stall... *

502
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,200
* Dearly Paul ... *

503
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,400
* my Paul *

504
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,100
{Y:i}Attention ...

505
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,600
{Y:i}Captain and crew standby reverse polarity.

506
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,400
{Y:i}Standard class A security will be maintained upon landing.

507
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,600
{Y:i}And until further notice all land in and hold on.

508
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,700
{Y:i}That is all.

509
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,200
{Y:i}Artificial gravity are ...

510
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,100
{Y:i}ad lock cut primary coarse.

511
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,600
{Y:i}Primary stature.

512
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,000
Lindsey ...

513
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,600
Lindseyyy ....

514
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,600
Where are you?

515
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,400
There is the boogeyman! He is outside!
Look, there is the boogeyman outside! - What's wrong?

516
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,300
I saw the boogeyman! I know that - Oh, Tommy stop it!
- But at Lindsey's! - You're scaring Lindsey.

517
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,000
He's over there!
- Tommy, stop it! There is nobody out there!

518
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,000
There's no boogeyman. And if you don't stop all this
I'll have to turn off the TV and send you to bed.

519
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,500
Nobody believes me.
- I believe you, Tommy.

520
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,500
I'm not afraid.

521
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,800
Bull.

522
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,600
I'm not.
- Then go in.

523
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,500
Chicken.

524
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,000
Go ahead, Lonnie.

525
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,500
Go in!

526
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,500
Hey!

527
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,700
Hey, Lonnie ...

528
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,300
Get your ass away from there ...

529
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,900
Jesus.

530
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,400
Are you all right here?

531
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,900
Yeah.

532
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:20,600
Well, nothing's going on except kids playing pranks,
trick or treating, partying, getting high.

533
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,900
I have the feeling you're way off on this.

534
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,100
You have the wrong feeling.
- You're not doing very much to prove me wrong.

535
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,900
What more do you need?

536
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,900
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk
to keep me up all night crawling around these bushes.

537
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,400
I, I, I watched him for fifteen years ...

538
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,400
sitting in a room, staring at a wall, not seeing the wall ...

539
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,900
looking past the wall

540
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,300
looking at ... THIS NIGHT inhumanly patient.

541
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,300
waiting for some secret, silent alarm ...

542
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,900
to trigger him off.

543
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,300
Death has come to your little town, sheriff.

544
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,500
You can either ignore it or you can help me to stop it.

545
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,600
More fancy talk.

546
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,900
Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is?

547
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,000
Families ...

548
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,200
Children ... all lined up in rows,
up and down these streets.

549
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,600
You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

550
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,200
They could be.

551
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,600
All right, I'll stay with you out tonight ...

552
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,900
just on the chance that you're right.

553
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,500
And if you are right ...

554
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,400
damn you for letting him go.

555
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,100
So we gonna first, we'll go inside, right?
Then we just talk a little.

556
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:50,100
Then Annie will distract Lindsey, that's when we'll
go upstairs to the first bedroom on the left. You got it?

557
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,400
First I rip your clothes off ...

558
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,100
Don't rip, my blouse is expensive, idiot.
- Then you rip my clothes off...

559
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,000
then we rip Lyndsey's cloth off. Yeah, I think I got it.

560
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Totally.

561
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,600
Bob ... put me down.

562
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,500
Put me down. This is totally silly.

563
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,700
Put me down.

564
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,100
Hey, it's totally dark.
- Yeah.

565
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,200
Annie!

566
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,500
Annie, we're here!
- I wonder where they went.

567
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,100
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something.

568
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,000
Hey, let's look for a note.

569
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,500
Let's not.

570
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,600
He's gonna get you ...

571
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,600
No, he's not. - Hey, nobody's getting anybody.
Stop scaring each other.

572
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,200
Everybody's having good time tonight.

573
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,700
All right, guys, what's next?

574
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:57,700
Let's make more popcorn. - No, we had enough.
Why don't we watch the rest of the movie?

575
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:58,900
Yeah.

576
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,100
{Y:i}All right, put it back on.

577
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,800
Doyle house.

578
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,900
Hi Laurie ... what's up?

579
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,100
{Y:i}I'm just setting down for the first time tonight.

580
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,600
Hey ... is Annie around?

581
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,300
{Y:i}No, I thought she'd be home by now.

582
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,700
{Y:i}She went to pick up Paul.
- Well, she's totally not here.

583
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,400
She's probably stopped off some place.

584
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,400
Have her call me when she gets home.
I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know
what time to put her to bed.

585
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,000
{Y:i}Okay. Later.
- Have a good time.

586
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,100
We definetely will.

587
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,200
Bye.

588
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:52,100
Lindsey is gone for the night.
- Hey, now that's wonderful.

589
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,400
Oh, shit! Not again.

590
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,400
I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing.

591
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,900
Oh, I can't keep you interested, huh?
- Just answer that damn phone.

592
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,900
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces?

593
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,600
We'd get Annie in trouble now.

594
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,600
Just take it off the hook.

595
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,300
Fantastic.

596
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,500
Totally.
- Yeah.

597
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,600
Is that all you can say?

598
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,400
Yeah.

599
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,400
Go get me a beer.
- I thought you were gonna get me one.

600
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,500
Yeaah.

601
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,600
I'll be right back.

602
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,800
Don't get dressed.

603
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,600
Annie?

604
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,900
Paul?

605
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,000
Lynda, you asshole!

606
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,600
Ok, Lynda.

607
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,700
Come on out.

608
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,200
Well, did you get my beer?

609
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,600
Cute, Bob. Real cute.

610
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,500
See anything you like?

611
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,900
What's the matter? Can I get your ghost, Bob?

612
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
All right, all right. Come on, where is my beer?

613
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,400
Ok, ain't answer me?

614
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,100
Ok, don't answer me?

615
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,800
Oh, you're weird!
- I'm gonna call Laurie.

616
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,400
Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.
I wanna know where Annie and Paul are.

617
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,900
This is going nowhere.

618
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,500
Finally.

619
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,500
Hello.

620
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,700
Hello?

621
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:50,000
All right, Annie. First I get your famous chewing,
now I get your famous squealing?

622
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,700
Annie, you all right?

623
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,600
Are you fooling around again?

624
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,900
I'll kill you if this is a joke.

625
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,800
{Y:i}Annie?

626
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,800
{Y:i}Annie?

627
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,900
Sleep tight, kids.

628
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,100
Paul?

629
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,400
Lynda?

630
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,600
Lynda?

631
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,200
Annie?

632
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,100
Annie?

633
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,600
Lynda?

634
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,300
Bob?

635
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,400
All right, Annie ...

636
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,800
All right, meatheads. The joke's over.

637
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,400
Come on, Annie.

638
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,500
It's enough.

639
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,400
This is most definitely stopping funny.
Now cut it out!

640
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,100
You'll be sorry.

641
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
No.

642
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,400
Help!

643
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,300
Somebody help me, please!

644
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,400
Somebody help!

645
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,500
Oh, God, help me!

646
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,300

Oh, God, help me, please!

650
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,100
Hello!

01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,700
Helloo!

652
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000

01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,700
Helloo, help me!

654
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,600
Will you please help me?

655
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:21,900
Please!

656
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,200
Can't you hear me?!

657
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,900
Oh,God ...

658
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,300
Help me, please!

659
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,300
The keys!

660
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,300
Oh, the keys!

661
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,500

Who is it?

665
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Tommy please!

666
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,400
Tommy, hurry up!

667
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,500
Tommy please!

668
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:24,800
Hurry up! Tommy please!

669
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,500
Tommy, go upstairs. - What is it, Laurie?
- Tommy go back upstairs,
grab the Lindsey and lock the door.

670
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,900
I'm scared!- Do what I say! Now!
- It's the boogeyman, isn't it? - Hurry!

671
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,600
Oh, no ...

672
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,300
Please, stop.

673
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,800
Please ...

674
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:21,600
Where were you? I went to the Meyers house.
- I found the car. He is here!

675
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,900
Where? - He's three blocks down.
You go around back off the houses, I'll watch the front.

676
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,000
Go on!

677
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,400
Tommy ... Lyndsey ...

678
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,000
Babies ...

679
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,600
We're gonna take a little walk.

680
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,900
Was it the boogeyman?

681
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,800
-I'm scared.
-There's nothing to be scared of.

682
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,300
Are you sure?

683
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,800
How?

684
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,500
I killed him.

685
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,200
You can't kill the boogeyman.

686
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,600
Get in there! Come on, Tommy! Now, lock the door!

687
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,100
Tommy ...

688
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,400
Unlock the door.

689
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,000
Come here.

690
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:14,900
Now just listen to me ...

691
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,500
I want you to go down the stairs ...

692
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,100
and out the front door.

693
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,500
And I want you to go down the street
to the Mackenzies' house ...

694
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,100
I want you to tell them to call the police.

695
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,100
And tell them to send them over here.

696
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,000
Laurie ...
- Now, do you understand me?

697
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,600
Yes. - Go. Do as I say.

698
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,200
Get help!

699
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,400
Come on!

700
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,000
Come on!

701
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,000
Was that the boogeyman?

702
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,000
As a matter of fact ...

703
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,100
it was.
