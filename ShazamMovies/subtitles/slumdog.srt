12
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,341
You have a name. Good.

13
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:44,542
Stop crying.

14
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,551
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

15
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:50,685
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

16
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:53,954
So,jamal...

17
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:55,517
<i>tell me something about yourself.</i>

18
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,961
I work in a call center.
In juhu.

19
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:05,027
Good.

20
00:03:05,104 --> 00:03:07,402
<i>Aphone basher.</i>

21
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:09,374
And what type of call center
would that be?

22
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:12,172
XL 5 mobile phones.

23
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:17,205
Oh. So you're the one who calls me up every
single day of my life with special offers, huh?

24
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:20,844
No. Actually, I'm an assistant.

25
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,888
An assistant phone basher?

26
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:29,051
And what does a assistant
phone basher do exactly?

27
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:32,222
I get tea for people and-

28
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:35,062
Chai wallah.
A chai wallah!

29
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:40,237
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

30
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,866
Jamal Malik-

<i>...from Mumbai, let's play

32
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,690
So, has he confessed yet?

33
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,785
Except his name, I could not get
anything out of the runt.

34
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:06,696
You have been here a whole bloody night,
Srinivas. What have you been doing?

35
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,757
He's a tough guy.

36
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:11,531
A little electricity will loosen his tongue.
Give him.

37
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:13,595
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:26,277
<i>Okay. So, were you wired up?
Mobile or a pager?</i>

39
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:30,618
A coughing accomplice
in the audience...

40
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,921
<i>or a microchip under the skin?</i>

41
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:36,655
Huh?

42
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,267
<i>- The chip is not here.
- Not here?</i>

43
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:45,327
- No.
- Okay. Leave the chip. Leave the chip. Leave the chip.

44
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,705
It's hot...

45
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:51,744
and my wife is giving me hell...

46
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:55,338
and I've got a desk full of
murderers, rapists...

47
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:59,283
extortionists, bum bandits and you.

48
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:04,622
So why don't you save us
both a lot of time...

49
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:09,020
and tell me how you cheated.

50
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,021
Hmm.

51
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:27,135
I'm done, sir.

52
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,575
Now, listen.

53
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:38,080
Hello.

54
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,555
He's unconscious,juti.
What good is that?

55
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,859
How many times
have I told you, Srinivas?

56
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:46,831
I'm sorry, sir.

57
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:50,164
<i>Srinivas. Now we'll have...</i>

58
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:53,000
Amnesty International here next,
peeing in their pants about human rights.

59
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:55,370
Sir, I was thinking, um-

60
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:58,808
<i>- Get him down, tidy him up, please, for God's sake!
- Sir...</i>

61
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:01,574
what if he did know the answers?

62
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:08,014
Professors, doctors, lawyers,
general knowledge wallahs...

63
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:10,146
never get beyond 16,000 rupees.

64
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:13,522
He's on 10 million.
What the hell can a...

65
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,584
slumdog possibly know?

66
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,821
The answers.

67
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:28,639
I knew the answers.

68
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:22,319
<i># They can't touch me We break off,run
so fast they can't even catch me #</i>

69
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:26,791
<i>#Been that gypsy Touch me, I show you

70
00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:29,123
<i>#Pick up their packs

71
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:31,459
<i>#Dogs run They start to

72
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:34,728
<i>#Some days they suck when we live
for the buck we get for the family #</i>

73
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:38,931
<i># One day I wanna be a star
so I get to hang in a bar #</i>

74
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,497
<i>#I'll go to Vegas if they pay us
just to forget my scars #</i>

75
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:48,312
Sorry.

76
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,981
Sorry. Sorry.

77
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,485
Sorry!

78
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:56,215
<i># They can't touch me
We break off #</i>

79
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:58,723
<i>- #Run so fast

80
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,782
<i>#Been that gypsy Touch me #</i>

81

82
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:19,410
<i>- Athos.!
- Athos.!</i>

83
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:23,073
<i>- Cried the two musketeers.
- Musketeers.</i>

84
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:25,413
<i>- Athos.!
- Athos.!</i>

85
00:09:25,484 --> 00:09:29,682
<i>Repeat it.
"You have sent for me, sir, '"said Athos.</i>

86
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:31,689
<i>- "You have sent for me, sir. "
- Ah.</i>

87
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:48,971
Huh?

88
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:11,225
So...

89
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:13,231
Mr. Malik...

90
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,859
the man who knows all the answers.

91
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:19,294
Talk.

92
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:22,297
Talk.

93
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:27,946
So,jamal...

94
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:31,506
are you ready for the first question
for 1,000 rupees?

95
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:33,575
Yes.

96
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:36,781
Not bad money to sit on a chair
and answer a question.

97
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:39,484
<i>Better than making tea, no?</i>

98
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:42,083
No. Yes. No.

99
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:44,026
No? Yes? No?

100
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:47,156
Is that your final answer?

101
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:50,999
<i>So, remember,you have
three lifelines.</i>

102
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,005
Ask the audience, fifty-fifty...

103
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:55,631
<i>phone a friend.</i>

104
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,269
So the first question for 1,000 rupees.
Here we go.

105
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,439
<i>Who was the star in
the 1973 hit film Zanjeer?</i>

106
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:06,911
Amitabh?

107
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:30,026
Amitabh Bachchan!

108
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:37,904
Salim!

109
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:12,068
Amitabh Bachchan!

110
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:16,908
<i>Amitabh.!</i>

111
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:50,109
Yea!

112
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:53,640
<i>Amitabh-</i>

113
00:14:57,616 --> 00:14:59,516
<i>"'A. '"Amitabh Bachchan.</i>

114
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:02,947
Guess what. You're right.
You just won 1,000 rupees.

115
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:08,960
You don't have to be a genius.

116
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:11,394
I knew it was Amitabh Bachchan.

117
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:13,454
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

118
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:16,626
Like I said, don't have to be
a genius.

119
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:21,598
He's the most famous man in India.

120
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,469
<i>Apicture of three lions...</i>

121
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:28,377
<i>is seen in the national
emblem of India.</i>

122
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:31,314
What is written underneath?

123
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:34,944
"A," the truth alone triumphs...

124
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,488
"B," lies alone triumph...

125
00:15:37,556 --> 00:15:41,390
<i>"C, '"fashion alone triumphs...</i>

126
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,294
"D," money alone triumphs?

127
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:51,670
What do you think,jamal?

128
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:56,133
<i>The most famous phrase
of our country.</i>

129
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,937
Would you like to phone a friend?

130
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,444
Ask the audience.

131
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:04,414
Put the poor man out of his misery,
ladies and gentlemen.

132
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:09,250
My five-year-old daughter can answer
that question, but you couldn't.

133
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,188
That's strange for
a millionaire genius.

134
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:14,192
What happened?

135
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,354
Your accomplice nip out for a piss?

136
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:20,193
The inspector is asking something.

137
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:24,032
How much is pani puri
at Harish's stall on Chowpatty?

138
00:16:24,103 --> 00:16:25,661
What?

139
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:28,434
<i>Pani puri. One plate, how much?</i>

140
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:31,374
- Ten rupees.
- Wrong.

141
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:33,434
Fifteen since Divali.

142
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:37,873
Who stole
Constable Vermaas's bicycle...

143
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,941
outside Santa Cruz
station last Thursday?

144
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,011
You know who that was?

145
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:45,784
Everyone in juhu knows that.

146
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:49,794
Even five-year-olds.

147
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:55,160
<i>Congratulations,jamal.
You just won 4,000 rupees.</i>

148
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:03,373
For 16,000 rupees.

149
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:07,338
Religion.

150
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:09,472
Interesting.

151
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:12,142
<i>In depictions of God Rama...</i>

152
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:16,586
<i>he is famously holding what
in his right hand?</i>

153
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:28,122
Hey,jamal.

154
00:18:26,658 --> 00:18:28,592
Jamal-

155
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:53,573
I wake up every morning wishing I didn't
know the answer to that question.

156
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:00,279
If it wasn't for Rama and Allah...

157
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:03,822
I would still have a mother.

158
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:15,656
A bow and arrow.

159
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,929
Final answer?

160
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:22,463
Final answer.

161
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,875
<i>Hmm. Ah. Computer-ji,

before any of the rooms
were built or any of the lifts.

01:03:56,519 --> 01:03:58,009
I'll kill you!

484
01:04:02,525 --> 01:04:05,153
I am number one now.

485
01:04:07,897 --> 01:04:11,196
Salim!

486
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:14,293
Salim, open it!

487
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,338
Shut up!

488
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:18,396
The man with the Colt. 45
says shut up!

489
01:04:18,474 --> 01:04:23,878
Go now, or Gunmaster G-9 will
shoot you right between the eyes.

490
01:04:24,881 --> 01:04:26,849
Don't think he won't.

491
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:31,182
I'm giving you five seconds.
One...

492
01:04:32,989 --> 01:04:34,923
two-

493
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,920
Go,jamal.

494
01:04:40,129 --> 01:04:42,063
Go.

495
01:05:06,856 --> 01:05:10,656
So, did you see them again?

496
01:05:10,726 --> 01:05:12,956
I wouldn't be here if I had.

497
01:05:14,931 --> 01:05:16,922
Was she pretty?

498
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:21,601
I guess not.

499
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:25,940
The most beautiful
woman in the world.

500
01:05:26,008 --> 01:05:28,238
He means "the bitch of the slums. "

501
01:05:28,311 --> 01:05:30,973
Hey. Hey!

502
01:05:31,047 --> 01:05:35,882
<i>Hey, no</i>

503
01:05:40,289 --> 01:05:42,553
<i>Well, well.</i>

504
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,422
The slumdog barks.

505
01:05:44,493 --> 01:05:46,961
<i>Money and women-</i>

506
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:49,224
<i>the reasons to make
most mistakes in life.</i>

507
01:05:49,298 --> 01:05:50,959
<i>Correct.</i>

508
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:53,001
Looks like you're
mixed up with both.

509
01:05:55,871 --> 01:05:57,805
<i>Srinivas.</i>

510
01:05:57,873 --> 01:06:00,171
You need the exercise.

511
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:03,212
<i>Go and get me something to eat.</i>

512
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:05,213
Yes, sir.

513
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:07,249
<i>And chai.</i>

514
01:06:09,385 --> 01:06:11,319
Phaode!

515
01:06:18,327 --> 01:06:20,488
Idiot, Srinivas.

516
01:06:26,736 --> 01:06:28,670
You puzzle me, slumdog-

517
01:06:28,738 --> 01:06:32,697
admitting murder to avoid
the charge of fraud...

518
01:06:32,775 --> 01:06:35,107
is not exactly clever thinking.

519
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:40,143
Now, why would you do that?

520
01:06:40,216 --> 01:06:42,343
Hmm?

521
01:06:42,418 --> 01:06:45,512
When somebody asks me a question...

522
01:06:45,588 --> 01:06:47,715
I tell them the answer.

523
01:06:49,759 --> 01:06:51,750
Hmm.

524
01:06:53,996 --> 01:06:58,160
<i>- So, how did you manage
to get on the show?</i>

525
01:07:00,536 --> 01:07:02,470
<i>Okay, everyone. Listen up.</i>

526
01:07:02,538 --> 01:07:05,837
It's been a big week for U.K.

527
01:07:05,908 --> 01:07:07,876
Kat is back.

528
01:07:07,943 --> 01:07:09,740
<i>But she was already back.</i>

529
01:07:09,812 --> 01:07:12,144
<i>Bardi. jamal?</i>

530
01:07:13,449 --> 01:07:16,247
Oh, well, she did come back.
Then she went away...

531
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:19,379
when Alfie split up with her,
and now she's back again.

532
01:07:19,455 --> 01:07:21,685
But it looks as if Alfie
still fancies Mo after all.

533
01:07:21,757 --> 01:07:24,225
Thank you,jamal.
Bardi, keep up.

534
01:07:24,293 --> 01:07:27,353
<i>The chai wallah knows more than you.</i>

535
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:31,161
<i>Anyway, there's also
the festival in Edinburgh.</i>

536
01:07:31,233 --> 01:07:33,929
<i>Anybody knows Edinburgh?
Edinburgh?</i>

537
01:07:34,003 --> 01:07:38,702
Ah, kilts, castles,
uh, haggis, uh, Ben Nevis.

538
01:07:38,774 --> 01:07:40,708
<i>Good. Yes?</i>

539
01:07:40,776 --> 01:07:44,303
<i>Inspector Taggart, whiskey, Sean Connery.</i>

540
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:47,747
<i>Good. And lochs-
their word for lakes.</i>

541
01:07:47,817 --> 01:07:49,751
No filming.

542
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:58,416
Jamal, come here.

543
01:07:58,494 --> 01:08:00,724
<i>I'm on Millionaire duty today.</i>

544
01:08:00,796 --> 01:08:03,594
- Dave-
- Please. just for five minutes.

545
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:05,031
I can't.

546
01:08:05,101 --> 01:08:07,695
Sit here.
If the team leader comes...

547
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:11,137
- just pretend you are on a call doing an
upgrade for- - Friends and Family. I know.

548
01:08:11,207 --> 01:08:13,198
- Yah.
- Two minutes.

549
01:08:13,275 --> 01:08:14,765
Ah.

550
01:08:18,681 --> 01:08:20,979
<i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

551
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,814
<i>Dial this number now.</i>

552
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:27,879
<i>Answer this question.
What does "'A. T.M. '"-</i>

553
01:08:27,957 --> 01:08:30,050
Hello? Hello? Hello?

554
01:08:30,126 --> 01:08:33,459
<i>I would like to be a contestant
on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

555
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:35,827
<i>- Hello? I want to be on-
- Uh-</i>

556
01:08:35,898 --> 01:08:38,765
Bloody bastard.
I never get it!

557
01:08:38,834 --> 01:08:41,302
You have to dial
when Prem says "if. "

558
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:44,464
- That's when they open the lines.
- How the hell do you know that?

559
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,771
That's what Anjum in technical says.
He put the system in.

560
01:08:47,843 --> 01:08:50,505
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

561
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:53,605
<i>Have I been transferred again,
for God's sake?</i>

562
01:08:53,682 --> 01:08:57,948
Hello? Good God,
will somebody talk to me?

563
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,079
Uh, hello...

564
01:09:00,156 --> 01:09:04,593
Mrs. Mackintosh
from... "King-uss-ie. "

565
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:08,824
<i>It's Kingussie, love.
Pronounced "Kingussie. '"</i>

566
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:11,662
So where are you from?
Abroad, I bet.

567
01:09:11,734 --> 01:09:14,999
Uh,just down the road
from your house, Mrs. Mackintosh.

568
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,697
Uh, next to the loch.

569
01:09:16,772 --> 01:09:19,536
<i>Och aye?
Which loch?</i>

570
01:09:19,608 --> 01:09:21,667
Loch-

571
01:09:21,744 --> 01:09:25,305
Loch- Big... Loch Ben.

572
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:29,147
Loch Big Ben. Next door
to Sean Connery's flat.

573
01:09:29,218 --> 01:09:31,982
<i>I'd like to speak to your supervisor, son.</i>

574
01:10:19,335 --> 01:10:22,065
<i>- Yes?
- Salim?</i>

575
01:10:22,137 --> 01:10:25,334
<i>- Who is this?
Do you know what time is this?</i>

576
01:10:30,613 --> 01:10:35,016
<i>Hello?</i>

577
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:51,698
Hello? Hello?

578
01:10:51,767 --> 01:10:54,201
<i>Who is this?</i>

579
01:10:56,338 --> 01:10:59,102
I'm calling from
XL 5 Communications, sir.

580
01:10:59,174 --> 01:11:01,642
As a valued customer,
we are offering you a free upgrade...

581
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,575
with our Friends and-

582
01:11:05,748 --> 01:11:07,739
Family-

583
01:11:07,816 --> 01:11:10,284
Jamal?

584
01:11:10,352 --> 01:11:13,082
I- Is that you, Brother?

585
01:11:13,155 --> 01:11:16,124
Where are you?
I thought you were dead or something.

586
01:11:16,191 --> 01:11:18,955
Listen. We had to go,jamal.

587
01:11:19,028 --> 01:11:23,055
Maman's guys- they were
searching the hotel.

588
01:11:23,132 --> 01:11:26,727
Jamal? Say something, please!

589
01:11:28,037 --> 01:11:30,801
Hello, Salim.

590
01:11:30,873 --> 01:11:33,068
<i>Cambridge Circus is not in Cambridge.</i>

591
01:11:33,142 --> 01:11:35,167
<i>Dare I ask why?</i>

592
01:11:35,244 --> 01:11:37,007
Too obvious.

593
01:11:37,079 --> 01:11:39,172
<i>There's definitely
an Oxford Circus in London.</i>

594
01:11:39,248 --> 01:11:44,242
<i>And there's a rowing race between Oxford
and Cambridge, so there's probably...</i>

595
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,288
a Cambridge Circus too, no?

596
01:11:46,355 --> 01:11:48,516
I'll go for "D," London.

597
01:11:48,591 --> 01:11:54,052
<i>Computer-ji, "D'"lock kiya-jaye.</i>

01:12:00,502 --> 01:12:03,164
<i>jamal Malik...</i>

599
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:05,468
you're absolutely right!

600
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:17,851
<i>It's getting hot in here.</i>

601
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,013
- Are you nervous?
- What?

602
01:12:20,089 --> 01:12:22,853
<i>Am I nervous?</i>

603
01:12:22,925 --> 01:12:25,519
It's you who's in
the hot seat, my friend.

604
01:12:25,594 --> 01:12:27,528
Oh, yes.

605
01:12:27,596 --> 01:12:29,723
Sorry.

606
01:12:29,798 --> 01:12:32,164
Bloody hell, he's got Prem on the run.

607
01:12:32,234 --> 01:12:34,828
- Finally.
- A few hours ago...

608
01:12:34,903 --> 01:12:38,999
you were giving chai
for the phone wallahs.

609
01:12:39,074 --> 01:12:42,703
And now you're richer
than they will ever be.

610
01:12:42,778 --> 01:12:45,246
What a player.

611
01:12:45,314 --> 01:12:47,475
Ladies and gentlemen, what a player!

612
01:13:30,025 --> 01:13:32,084
Jamal?

613
01:13:34,129 --> 01:13:37,360
God is good, bhai.
God is good.

614
01:13:53,348 --> 01:13:56,442
Maman's guys were after us.
We just had to skip.

615
01:13:56,518 --> 01:13:58,850
- Liar.
- Left a message for you at work.

616
01:13:58,921 --> 01:14:01,719
- Waited weeks for you at Nagpur.
- There was no message.

617
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:03,815
Bhai, I definitely left a message.

618
01:14:03,892 --> 01:14:07,988
There was no message. There was
no message! There was no message!

619
01:14:12,568 --> 01:14:15,093
I will never forgive you.

620
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:22,943
I know.

621
01:14:26,715 --> 01:14:29,650
<i>That used to be our slum.</i>

622
01:14:31,353 --> 01:14:33,321
Can you believe that, huh?

623
01:14:33,388 --> 01:14:36,323
We used to live right there, man.

624
01:14:38,494 --> 01:14:41,463
Now it's all business.

625
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:45,330
India is at the center
of the world hub, bhai.

626
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,334
And I-

627
01:14:47,402 --> 01:14:49,370
I am at the center...

628
01:14:49,438 --> 01:14:51,702
of the center.

629
01:14:53,575 --> 01:14:56,169
This is alljaved-bhai's.

630
01:14:57,913 --> 01:15:01,212
- javed Khan?
- Sorry.

631
01:15:01,283 --> 01:15:03,513
<i>The gangster from our slum?
You work for him?</i>

632
01:15:03,585 --> 01:15:07,351
Come on. Who else do you think would
save us from Maman's guys, huh?

633
01:15:07,422 --> 01:15:09,390
What do you do for him?

634
01:15:11,527 --> 01:15:13,461
Anything he asks.

635
01:15:21,236 --> 01:15:24,433
He's coming.
You need to go now.

636
01:15:24,506 --> 01:15:27,373
- Take my card.
- What for?

637
01:15:27,442 --> 01:15:30,570
You think I'm gonna let you
out of my sights again, huh?

638
01:15:30,646 --> 01:15:32,705
You stay with me now,
younger brother.

639
01:15:32,781 --> 01:15:35,215
Now go- my place.

640
01:15:35,284 --> 01:15:38,378
Salim, where is Latika?

641
01:15:38,453 --> 01:15:40,478
Still?

642
01:15:43,959 --> 01:15:48,692
She's gone, Brother.
Long gone. Now go.

643
01:15:48,764 --> 01:15:51,289
Go to my place.

644
01:16:13,322 --> 01:16:15,256
<i>- #Hey #
- Hello?</i>

645
01:16:15,324 --> 01:16:17,121
Okay, I'll be right there.

646
01:17:03,038 --> 01:17:04,972
<i>#Hey #</i>

647
01:17:06,074 --> 01:17:09,908
<i>#Hey #</i>

648
01:17:10,979 --> 01:17:12,344
<i>#Hey #</i>

649
01:17:33,035 --> 01:17:34,969
<i>#Hey #</i>

650
01:17:36,038 --> 01:17:37,767
<i>#Hey ##</i>

651
01:17:37,839 --> 01:17:40,637
I'm the new cook from the agency.
A thousand apologies.

652
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:43,234
I am so late for the memsahib.

653
01:17:43,312 --> 01:17:45,246
Just a minute.

654
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,228
<i>Excuse me.</i>

655
01:18:03,298 --> 01:18:05,858
<i>There's nothing about any cook.</i>

656
01:18:05,934 --> 01:18:08,129
There is a dishwasher being delivered.

657
01:18:08,203 --> 01:18:10,467
Do you know anything about that?

658
01:18:10,539 --> 01:18:14,066
<i>I am your dishwasher.</i>

659
01:19:15,337 --> 01:19:17,032
Jamal.

660
01:19:22,511 --> 01:19:24,672
Look at you.

661
01:19:31,053 --> 01:19:32,987
I found you.

662
01:19:35,557 --> 01:19:37,491
I found you.

663
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:47,260
Your face.

664
01:19:47,335 --> 01:19:49,462
You've hurt your eye.

665
01:19:49,538 --> 01:19:51,802
Why are you here?

666
01:19:53,408 --> 01:19:55,342
To see you.

667
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:59,039
Well, you see me.

668
01:19:59,114 --> 01:20:01,105
Now what?

669
01:20:01,183 --> 01:20:05,119
<i>"C, '"Eden's Bridge...</i>

670
01:20:05,187 --> 01:20:07,587
<i>or "D, '"Apple's Bridge.</i>

671
01:20:09,724 --> 01:20:13,160
Why does everyone love this program?

672
01:20:14,429 --> 01:20:19,128
It's a chance to escape, isn't it?

673
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:21,567
Walk into another life.

674
01:20:21,636 --> 01:20:24,469
<i>Oh, God.</i>

675
01:20:28,176 --> 01:20:30,838
Javed will kill you.
Just- Here.

676
01:20:30,912 --> 01:20:33,847
Javed? You're with him?

677
01:20:44,092 --> 01:20:46,253
First you order a dishwasher.

678
01:20:47,729 --> 01:20:49,663
Now you want this fucking cook, huh?

679
01:20:49,731 --> 01:20:51,562
- I just thought-
- Shut up!

680
01:20:51,633 --> 01:20:55,660
<i>The cricket is on.</i>

681
01:20:55,737 --> 01:20:58,365
And why do you watch this shit TV?

682
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,136
As it is I am a millionaire.

683
01:21:03,311 --> 01:21:06,337
Come on. I'm hungry.
Make me a sandwich.

684
01:21:23,131 --> 01:21:25,691
<i>I want to bet five lakh rupees
he'll make a century.</i>

685
01:21:30,438 --> 01:21:33,066
Ah! Make it seven then.

686
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:35,371
Mm. Yeah.

687
01:21:37,612 --> 01:21:39,546
Come away with me.

688
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:43,674
Away where?

689
01:21:43,752 --> 01:21:46,220
And live on what?

690
01:21:50,258 --> 01:21:51,748
Love.

691
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:58,124
Come away with me... now.

692
01:22:05,674 --> 01:22:07,665
Mm!

693
01:22:12,113 --> 01:22:15,082
Salim will help us.

694
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:17,345
Salim?

695
01:22:18,386 --> 01:22:20,684
You still believe in Salim?

696
01:22:24,226 --> 01:22:26,990
Jamal, I'll be gone soon anyway.

697
01:22:27,062 --> 01:22:29,394
We're getting out of Bombay.

698
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:33,567
Where?

699
01:22:33,635 --> 01:22:35,933
<i>- Do you think he'd tell me?
- No.</i>

700
01:22:36,004 --> 01:22:38,495
Not the second- No!
No! No!

701
01:22:38,573 --> 01:22:41,133
And could that be
a hundred for Tendulkar?

702
01:22:41,209 --> 01:22:44,508
To the third umpire, Billy Bowden.

703
01:22:44,579 --> 01:22:46,513
<i>Takes the fielder on.</i>

704
01:22:46,581 --> 01:22:48,572
<i>In the deep.
That's a good throw.</i>

705
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:50,845
<i>Flat.
He looks confident.</i>

706
01:22:50,919 --> 01:22:53,649
<i>Yeah, I wouldn't be.</i>

707
01:22:53,722 --> 01:22:56,987
<i>Boucher seems very, very confident.</i>

708
01:22:58,393 --> 01:23:01,021
What is this shit?

709
01:23:01,096 --> 01:23:02,757
<i>Get out.</i>

710
01:23:02,831 --> 01:23:04,890
Get out!

711
01:23:12,073 --> 01:23:14,564
Now go... before he kills us both.

712
01:23:16,111 --> 01:23:19,137
- You want to do something for me?
- Anything.

713
01:23:19,214 --> 01:23:22,877
- Then forget me.
- What? No.

714
01:23:22,951 --> 01:23:25,146
I'll wait...

715
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:29,156
at the V.T. station 5:00 every day
until you come.

716
01:23:32,961 --> 01:23:35,452
I love you.

717
01:23:36,531 --> 01:23:38,795
So what?

718
01:23:38,867 --> 01:23:41,358
It's too late,jamal.
Now go.

719
01:23:51,746 --> 01:23:54,544
<i>So,jamal, which cricketer
has scored...</i>

720
01:23:54,616 --> 01:23:57,551
the most first class
centuries in history?

721
01:23:57,619 --> 01:24:00,019
"A," Sachin Tendulkar...

722
01:24:00,088 --> 01:24:02,079
"B," Ricky Ponting...

723
01:24:02,157 --> 01:24:04,091
"C," Michael Slater...

724
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,855
or "D,"jack Hobbs?

725
01:24:09,164 --> 01:24:13,157
<i>But remember, if you answer wrong...</i>

726
01:24:13,234 --> 01:24:17,500
you lose everything-
just like this.

727
01:24:19,974 --> 01:24:22,408
So do you want to do this?

728
01:24:39,461 --> 01:24:41,827
<i>That's the way,jamal.!</i>

729
01:24:46,935 --> 01:24:49,165
Dreams of so many...

730
01:24:50,839 --> 01:24:53,000
on the floor.

731
01:26:10,618 --> 01:26:12,882
Latika. Latika!

732
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:18,350
Latika!

Latika!

740

Latika! Latika!

741
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:38,068
<i>Time for a commercial break,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

742
01:27:40,842 --> 01:27:44,107
<i>I know, I know.
I can't stand the tension either.</i>

743
01:27:44,178 --> 01:27:46,203
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

744
01:27:55,123 --> 01:27:57,785
Guy from the slums...

745
01:27:57,859 --> 01:28:00,453
<i>becomes a millionaire overnight.</i>

746
01:28:00,528 --> 01:28:04,294
<i>- Do you know who's the only
other person who's done that?</i>

747
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:08,529
Me.

748
01:28:08,603 --> 01:28:11,595
<i>I know what it feels like.</i>

749
01:28:11,673 --> 01:28:14,301
<i>I know what you've been through.</i>

750
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:17,173
I'm not going to become a millionaire.

751
01:28:17,245 --> 01:28:19,179
I don't know the answer.

752
01:28:19,247 --> 01:28:22,978
You've said that before, yeah.

753
01:28:23,051 --> 01:28:26,487
No. Really.
This time I don't.

754
01:28:26,554 --> 01:28:29,523
<i>Come on. You can't take
the money and run now.</i>

755
01:28:31,893 --> 01:28:34,361
You're on the edge of history, kid.

756
01:28:34,429 --> 01:28:37,023
I don't see what else I can do.

757
01:28:37,098 --> 01:28:39,965
Maybe it's written, my friend.

758
01:28:40,034 --> 01:28:41,968
I don't know.

759
01:28:42,036 --> 01:28:46,097
<i>I just get some kind ofkarmic feeling
you're going to win this.</i>

760
01:28:46,174 --> 01:28:48,233
Trust me,jamal.

761
01:28:50,078 --> 01:28:52,569
You're going to win.

762
01:29:24,078 --> 01:29:26,808
<i>Stand by, everyone.
We're on live in 30.</i>

763
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:30,373
<i>Get him back
on the floor,yeah. Prem is waiting.</i>

764
01:29:30,451 --> 01:29:32,783
<i>Yeah, he's coming. He's coming.
I'm just getting him.</i>

765
01:29:33,988 --> 01:29:37,480
<i>Go first.
Twenty seconds.</i>

766
01:29:43,431 --> 01:29:48,061
Do the right thing, and in approximately
three minutes, you'll be as famous as me.

767
01:29:48,136 --> 01:29:50,536
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

768
01:29:50,605 --> 01:29:52,698
And as rich as me.

769
01:29:54,242 --> 01:29:56,176
Almost.

770
01:29:56,244 --> 01:29:59,042
<i>Five seconds. Four, three-</i>

771
01:29:59,113 --> 01:30:02,879
<i>From rags to raja.
It's your destiny.</i>

772
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:05,919
<i>We are on.!
Applause and music, please.!</i>

773
01:30:14,929 --> 01:30:17,261
Jib move out.
Cut to two.

774
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:22,598
<i>Welcome back to
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>

775
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:25,002
In the chair tonight is jamal Malik.

776
01:30:25,073 --> 01:30:27,303
<i>- Yeah.!
- As if you don't know.</i>

777
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:31,243
<i>For 10 million rupees-</i>

778
01:30:31,312 --> 01:30:33,940
The question once again:

779
01:30:36,084 --> 01:30:41,317
Which cricketer has scored
the most first class centuries in history?

780
01:30:43,124 --> 01:30:46,958
- I know it isn't Sachin Tendulkar.
- That's a start.

781
01:30:47,028 --> 01:30:49,019
<i>So it could be Ricky Ponting...</i>

782
01:30:49,097 --> 01:30:52,430
Jack Hobbs or Michael Slater.

783
01:30:54,736 --> 01:30:57,762
I'll use a lifeline- fifty-fifty.

784
01:30:57,839 --> 01:31:01,900
Okay. Computer, take away
two wrong answers, please.

785
01:31:05,079 --> 01:31:08,606
Well, you were right
about Sachin Tendulkar.

786
01:31:08,683 --> 01:31:12,084
That leaves you a fifty-fifty choice,jamal.
"B," Ricky Ponting...

787
01:31:12,153 --> 01:31:14,849
or "D,"jack Hobbs?

788
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:19,150
<i>What do you think?</i>

789
01:31:19,227 --> 01:31:22,162
<i>Decision time.</i>

790
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:25,597
For 10 million rupees.

791
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:29,033
"B," Ricky Ponting...

792
01:31:29,103 --> 01:31:32,163
<i>or "D, '"jack Hobbs?</i>

793
01:31:45,086 --> 01:31:47,077
"D."

794
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,894
Not "B"?

795
01:31:55,963 --> 01:31:57,897
<i>"B, '"Ricky Ponting...</i>

796
01:31:57,965 --> 01:32:00,957
<i>the Australian great cricketer?</i>

01:32:02,937 --> 01:32:05,565
"D,"jack Hobbs.

798
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,006
You know?

799
01:32:10,912 --> 01:32:14,473
So it could be "B," Ricky Ponting.

800
01:32:14,549 --> 01:32:17,382
Or "D,"jack Hobbs.

801
01:32:19,253 --> 01:32:22,347
<i>Final answer- "D. '"</i>

802
01:32:23,758 --> 01:32:27,159
<i>Computer-ji, "D. '"

Computer-ji, "D'"lock kiya-jaye.</i>

804
01:32:41,108 --> 01:32:42,905
With...

805
01:32:42,977 --> 01:32:47,539

<i>I cannot believe my eyes,

810
01:33:08,769 --> 01:33:11,932
This needs a dance, man!
Come on! Come on!

811
01:33:14,909 --> 01:33:17,400
Well done. Well done.

812
01:33:39,433 --> 01:33:42,960
<i>So, are you ready...</i>

813
01:33:43,037 --> 01:33:45,267
for the final question?

814
01:33:45,339 --> 01:33:49,901
For 20 million rupees.

815
01:33:52,747 --> 01:33:54,681
No.

816
01:33:54,749 --> 01:33:57,650
But maybe it's written, no?

817
01:33:59,287 --> 01:34:00,811
Maybe.

818
01:34:02,256 --> 01:34:06,420
<i>Okay, the final question
on Who Wants to Be a-</i>

819
01:34:10,197 --> 01:34:13,928
What a show, ladies and gentlemen.

820
01:34:14,001 --> 01:34:17,334
What a show!
Join us tomorrow night to see...

821
01:34:17,405 --> 01:34:19,839
<i>ifjamal Malik has made

in the history of Indian television.</i>

823
01:34:23,978 --> 01:34:25,912
- This way.
- Yeah. Let's just-

824
01:34:29,317 --> 01:34:31,251
Come,jamal.

825
01:34:33,654 --> 01:34:35,588
Great show.

826
01:34:38,726 --> 01:34:41,058
See you tomorrow, okay?
Be on time.

827
01:34:41,128 --> 01:34:43,358
- Yeah.
- Bye.

828
01:34:47,401 --> 01:34:50,632
Careful.

829
01:34:50,705 --> 01:34:53,674
<i>What's going on?</i>

830
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:03,511
- He's a cheat.
- How do you know he's cheating?

831
01:35:06,153 --> 01:35:08,087
Bloody village boy.

832
01:35:08,155 --> 01:35:11,147
I fed him the wrong answer,
and that little shit got it right.

833
01:35:11,225 --> 01:35:13,159
You gave him an answer?

834
01:35:13,227 --> 01:35:15,388
Not exactly.

835
01:35:15,463 --> 01:35:19,490
But how does it matter?
It's- It's my show.

836
01:35:19,567 --> 01:35:21,797
It's my fucking show!

837
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,779
It is bizarrely plausible.

838
01:35:37,351 --> 01:35:42,448
- And yet-
- Because I'm a slumdog, a chai wallah...

839
01:35:42,523 --> 01:35:45,856
<i>- I'm a liar, right?
- Most of you are.</i>

840
01:35:45,926 --> 01:35:50,090
But you are not a liar, Mr. Malik.
That's for sure.

841
01:35:50,164 --> 01:35:52,098
You're too truthful.

842
01:35:55,102 --> 01:35:57,093
We're done.

843
01:36:00,775 --> 01:36:03,141
I don't know where
they've taken her.

844
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,774
Latika.

845
01:36:18,959 --> 01:36:20,893
I went on the show...

846
01:36:20,961 --> 01:36:23,191
because I thought she'd be watching.

847
01:36:36,944 --> 01:36:38,878
<i>Did jamal Malik...</i>

<i>In the crowd around me,
there is an even bigger question.</i>

851
01:36:49,523 --> 01:36:53,516
<i>Will he be back tonight to play for another
20 million rupees?</i>

852
01:36:53,594 --> 01:36:55,960
<i>jamal Malik-</i>

854
01:37:31,899 --> 01:37:33,833
<i>- Come here.
- You want it?</i>

855
01:37:33,901 --> 01:37:36,995
<i>Yeah, I want it. Come on, girls.!</i>

856
01:37:55,322 --> 01:37:58,189
<i>And if there wasn't
enough drama in a contestant...</i>

857
01:37:58,259 --> 01:38:00,819
<i>reaching the final question,

860
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,492
He will never give up.

861
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:11,697
Never.

862
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:15,532
<i>Crazy chutiye.</i>

863
01:38:24,118 --> 01:38:27,110
- Go.
- But-

864
01:38:27,188 --> 01:38:29,213
Just drive.

865
01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:31,554
There won't be another chance.

866
01:38:36,797 --> 01:38:38,890
He will kill you.

867
01:38:43,003 --> 01:38:45,335
I'll take care of him.

868
01:38:47,808 --> 01:38:49,742
Salim.

869
01:38:49,810 --> 01:38:51,903
I can't.

870
01:38:56,317 --> 01:38:58,717
You have to.

871
01:39:05,526 --> 01:39:07,790
For God's sake, hold on to this.

872
01:39:12,132 --> 01:39:16,000
And for what I've done,
please forgive me.

873
01:39:27,715 --> 01:39:31,344
Have a good life.

874
01:40:00,581 --> 01:40:03,607

and a staggering 20 million rupees.

899

<i>"'A, '"Aramis,

<i>You don't?</i>

916

<i>So you take the 10 million and walk?</i>

917

No.

<i>I'll play.</i>

919
01:44:30,951 --> 01:44:33,715
Let me remind you,jamal.

920
01:44:33,787 --> 01:44:36,585
If you get the answer wrong...

921
01:44:36,657 --> 01:44:39,217
you lose everything.

922
01:44:39,293 --> 01:44:43,889
Ten million rupees,jamal.

923

<i>It's a fortune.</i>

924

<i>I'd like to phone a friend.</i>

We're going to the wire.

01:44:53,941 --> 01:44:56,842
The final lifeline.

<i>Who is it?</i>

930
01:45:15,429 --> 01:45:18,990
<i>It's my brother's number, but-</i>

931
01:45:19,066 --> 01:45:22,661
The kind of brother who'd go for a walk...

932
01:45:22,736 --> 01:45:25,364
on a 20 million rupee question?

933

<i>It's the only number I know.</i>

934
01:45:55,769 --> 01:45:58,897

<i>Okay, Latika. You want to hear
the question one more time?</i>

941

<i>Twenty million rupees ride on your answer.

<i>- Yes.
- The question,jamal. The question.</i>

953
01:46:59,766 --> 01:47:03,065
- Fifteen seconds.
- Where are you?

954
01:47:03,136 --> 01:47:05,127
I'm safe.

955

01:47:34,701 --> 01:47:40,003
Your final answer

"A."

962

Just... because.
