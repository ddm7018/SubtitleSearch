1
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,390
You never did eat your lunch,
did you?

2
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:57,606
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours...

3
00:02:57,693 --> 00:02:59,605
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:01,561
Why don't you call your boss
and tell him...

5
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,864
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,341
It's Friday anyway,
and hot.

7
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:11,251
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:13,816
Well, we could laze
around here a while longer.

9
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,770
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.

10
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:21,247
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in...

11
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,724
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:26,548
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:28,548
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night...

14
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,373
in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,371
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:37,108
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

17
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:40,237
Oh, Sam, this is
the last time.

18
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:43,844
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

19
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,625
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

20
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:50,493
You come down here
on business trips...

21
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,883
and we steal lunch hours.

22
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,012
I wish you
wouldn't even come.

23
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,706
What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

24
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:02,009
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

25
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:07,441
- I can come down next week.
- No.

26
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:12,613
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch in public?

27
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,872
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

28
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,871
But respectably.

29
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:21,782
In my house with my mother's
picture on the mantel and...

30
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:25,563
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

31
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,953
And after the steak, do we
send sister to the movies...

32
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,952
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

33
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,081
Sam!

34
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:36,427
All right.

35
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:45,118
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

36
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:49,725
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

37
00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:53,115
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

38
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:58,504
I'm all for it. It requires patience,
temperance, a lot of sweating out.

39
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,849
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

40
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:07,977
But if I can see you and touch you
even as simply as this, I won't mind it.

41
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:12,757
I'm tired of sweating
for people who aren't there.

42
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,755
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

43
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:18,798
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,
and she's living...

44
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,493
on the other side of the world.

45
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,405
I pay too.

46
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:27,576
They also pay
who meet in hotel rooms.

47
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:32,964
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

48
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:35,138
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

49
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:39,831
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- But when you do, you'll swing.

50
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:42,873
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

51
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:51,607
And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

52
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:54,215
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:57,953
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

54
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,777
I'll lick the stamps.

55
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:13,337
You want to cut this off, go out
and find yourself somebody available?

56
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,814
I'm thinking of it.

57
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:22,375
How could you even
think a thing like that?

58
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,200
- Don't miss your plane.
- We can leave together, can't we?

59
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:29,112
Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh,
you have to put your shoes on.

60
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:44,408
Isn't Mr Lowery
back from lunch?

61
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:47,406
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

62
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:50,926
The old lease man. That's why
he's late. You got a headache?

63
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,925
It'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions...

64
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,532
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

65
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,531
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

66
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:02,443
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

67
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:05,572
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquillizers.

68
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,744
Any calls?

69
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:12,134
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

70
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:15,480
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying...

71
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,827
- and she'll be gone the whole weekend...

72
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:25,562
Wow. It's as hot
as fresh milk.

73
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:30,298
Hey, you girls oughta get your boss
to air condition ya up.

74
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:32,472
He can afford it today.

75
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:35,601
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?

76
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:39,598
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my little girl.

77
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:43,032
Oh... Oh, not you.
My daughter.

78
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,465
A baby.

79
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:50,419
Tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

80
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:55,373
- I want you to take a look at my baby.

81
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:58,850
Eighteen years old...

82
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:03,587
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

83
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,802
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.

84
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,410
Do you know what I do
about unhappiness?

85
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:12,017
I buy it off.

86
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,494
Are, uh...
Are you unhappy?

87
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:17,536
Uh, not inordinately.

88
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:24,142
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

89
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:26,837
Forty thousand
dollars cash.

90
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,791
Now that's...
that's not buying happiness.

91
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:34,311
That's just buying off unhappiness.

92
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:39,613
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

93
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,046
- Count 'em!
- I declare!

94
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,653
I don't. That's how
I get to keep it.

95
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,912
Tom, a cash transaction
of this size is most irregular.

96
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,693
Ah, so what?
It's my private money.

97
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:55,996
- Now it's yours.
- Suppose we put it in the safe...

98
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:59,472
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

99
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,600
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said was in your desk?

100
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:08,642
Uh-oh.

101
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:13,335
You know, uh, sometimes
I can keep my mouth shut.

102
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,766
Lowery, I am dying
of "thirst-aroonie."

103
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,111
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

104
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:32,109
Put it in the safe deposit box in the
bank, and we'll get a cheque on Monday.

105
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:34,716
Yes.

106
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:43,190
He was flirting with you. I guess
he must've noticed my wedding ring.

107
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:58,444
Come in.

108
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,224
The copies. If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home after the bank.

109
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,613
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

110
00:10:06,744 --> 00:10:09,656
Because me and your boss are goin' out
and get ourselves...

111
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,655
a little drinkin' done, right?

112
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,479
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

113
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:19,129
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

114
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,476
I'm going to spend this weekend
in bed. Thank you.

115
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:28,690
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

116
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:32,166
Can't buy off unhappiness
with pills.

117
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:37,120
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

118
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:42,667
Marion, what in
the world... What are you doing up here?

119
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:45,493
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.

120
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,490
What is it, Marion?

121
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:28,703
- Uh, hold it there.

122
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,308
In quite a hurry.

123
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:41,870
I didn't intend to sleep so long. I
almost had an accident from sleepiness.

124
00:14:41,957 --> 00:14:45,607
- So, I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

125
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:49,562
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

126
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:53,082
There are plenty of motels
in this area. You should've...

127
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:55,342
I mean, just to be safe.

128
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:58,341
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over.

129
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:00,427
Have I broken any laws?

130
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:02,730
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

131
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,945
Is anything wrong?

132
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,682
Of course not. Am I acting
as if there's something wrong?

133
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:15,723
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

134
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:18,505
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

135
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,719
I've told you there's nothing wrong,
except I'm in a hurry...

136
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,719
and you're taking up my time.

137
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,717
- Now, just a moment.

138
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:31,325
- Turn your motor off, please.

139
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:34,279
May I see your licence?

140
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:39,929
- Why?
- Please.

141
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:48,127
Be with you
in a second!

142
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:53,834
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

143
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:56,963
There's an old saying: "First customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

144
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,962
But I'm in no mood for it...

145
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:01,526
so I'm gonna treat you so fair
you won't have one reason...

146
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:05,176
- Can I trade my car and take another?
- Do anything you have a mind to.

147
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:08,174
Bein' a woman, you will.
That yours?

148
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes, it's, it's... There's
nothing wrong with it. I just...

149
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:12,998
Sick of the sight of it.

150
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:16,606
Have a look around and see if there's
something that strikes your eyes...

151
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,953
and I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

152
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,820
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...

153
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:22,646
and just wanna make a change.

154
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:25,514
One thing people never oughta be
when they're buyin' used cars...

155
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:28,470
and that's in a hurry, but like I said,
it's too nice a day to argue.

156
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:31,250
I'll shoot your car
in the garage here.

157
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,153
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

158
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,890
- How much?
- Go ahead.

159
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:57,629
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

160
00:19:57,715 --> 00:19:59,628
How much would it be
with my car?

161
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:02,888
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

162
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:07,363
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasin' ya?

163
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:09,362
Of course not.
Please.

164
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:15,316
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high pressured the salesman.

165
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:19,879
Ah, I figure roughly...

166
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:22,965
your car plus $700.

167
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:27,440
- Seven hundred.
- You always got time to argue money.

168
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,570
All right.

169
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:36,654
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

170
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,913
I mean, out-of-state licence.
You got your pink slip...

171
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:43,215
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies room?

172
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:46,083
In the building.

173
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:58,729
Over there.

174
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:57,744
I think you better take it
for a trial spin.

175
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:00,525
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

176
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:03,524
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this...

177
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:07,913
I might as well be perfectly honest with
you. It's not that I don't trust you...

178
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,433
But what? Is there
anything so terribly wrong...

179
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,041
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

180
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:17,430
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

181
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:21,037
All right,
let's go inside.

182
00:22:57,324 --> 00:22:59,236
Hey!

183
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,883
Just put it in here, please.

184
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,229
Thank you.

185
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:23,659
Heck,
Officer, that was the first time...

186
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:26,527
I saw the customer
high pressure the salesman.

187
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,525
Somebody chasin' her?

188
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:31,524
I better have
a look at those papers, Charlie.

189
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:35,826
- She look like a wrong one to you?
- Acted like one.

190
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:40,086
The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

191
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:50,341
Yes, Mr Lowery.

192
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,688
Caroline. Marion still isn't in?

193
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:56,469
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

194
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:59,989
Buzz me the minute
she comes in.

195
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,378
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.

196
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:07,855
I called her sister where she works...
The Music Makers Music Store...

197
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:10,679
and she doesn't know where Marion
is any more than we do.

198
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:14,546
You better run out to the house. She may
be, well, unable to answer the phone.

199
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:17,893
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

200
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:23,977
No, I haven't the faintest idea.

201
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:27,062
As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

202
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,712
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.

203
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,494
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.

204
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:36,884
I did see her
some time later driving...

205
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,056
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

206
00:24:41,142 --> 00:24:44,054
Caroline,
get Mr Cassidy for me.

207
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,312
After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!

208
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:52,745
I'm not taking
the responsibility.

209
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:57,308
Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works
for you for ten years, you trust her.

210
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,307
All right, yes,
you better come over.

211
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:04,913
Well, I ain't
about to kiss off $40,000!

212
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,043
I'll get it back, and if any of it's
missin', I'll replace it...

213
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,041
with her fine, soft flesh!

214
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:12,084
- We'll track her, never you doubt it.
-  Hold on, Cassidy.

215
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,385
I still can't believe... It must be
some kind of a mystery. l, I can't...

216
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:20,732
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

217
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,947
You still trustin'? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!

218
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:29,770
Hardly even looked at it. Plannin'.
And, and even flirtin' with me!

219
00:27:54,787 --> 00:27:59,958
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.

220
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:07,433
- Dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

221
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,779
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
12 cabins, 12 vacancies.

222
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:15,169
They, uh... They moved
away the highway.

223
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:19,080
Oh, I thought I'd gotten
off the main road.

224
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:24,337
I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops
here any more unless they've done that.

225
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:28,336
But... there's no sense
dwelling on our losses.

226
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:32,638
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

227
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:40,026
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

228
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,675
Los Angeles.

229
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:56,539
Cabin one. It's closer in case you want
anything. It's right next to the office.

230
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:59,451
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

231
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,927
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

232
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:07,708
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

233
00:29:26,785 --> 00:29:29,089
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

234
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:37,433
Well, the, uh, mattress
is soft and...

235
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,779
there's hangers in the closet
and stationary...

236
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:41,778
with "Bates Motel"
printed on it...

237
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:45,558
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

238
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:47,602
And the, uh...

239
00:29:48,992 --> 00:29:51,686
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

240
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:54,120
Yeah.

241
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:58,509
Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything,
just... just tap on the wall.

242
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,508
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr Bates.

243
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:03,072
Norman Bates.

244
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:08,982
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

245
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:11,460
- No.
- Then would you do me a favour?

246
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:13,285
Would you have dinner with me?

247
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:17,848
I was just about to myself. Nothing
special... just sandwiches and milk.

248
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:21,628
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

249
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,105
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

250
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:28,842
- I'd like to.
- All right.

251
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,623
You get yourself settled and,
and take off your wet shoes.

252
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,143
- I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
- Okay.

253
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:38,837
- With my... With my trusty umbrella.

254
00:31:58,711 --> 00:32:01,796
No! I tell you no!

255
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:04,882
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

256
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:08,836
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion...

257
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:12,530
- of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
-  Mother, please.

258
00:32:12,617 --> 00:32:15,964
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

259
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,179
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

260
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:24,741
"Mother, she's just a stranger." As if
men don't desire strangers. As if...

261
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:29,392
Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

262
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:31,695
Do you understand, boy?
Go on.

263
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:34,824
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite...

264
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:37,562
with my food or my son!

265
00:32:37,648 --> 00:32:40,604
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

266
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:45,210
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

267
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:30,536
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No, uh...

268
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:33,535
Mother...
My mother, uh...

269
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:36,272
What is the phrase?

270
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,574
She isn't quite
herself today.

271
00:33:39,662 --> 00:33:44,920
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

272
00:33:45,007 --> 00:33:47,657
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:53,090
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

274
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:55,089
Don't worry about it.

275
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:59,087
But as long as you've fixed
the supper, we may as well eat it.

276
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:13,428
It, uh... It might be, uh, nicer
and warmer in the office.

277
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:29,159
Well, it stopped
raining.

278
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:33,201
Uh, eating in an office
is just... just too officious.

279
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:36,243
- I have the parlour back here.
- All right.

280
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:54,625
- Sit down.
- Oh, thank you.

281
00:34:57,536 --> 00:35:00,839
You're very kind.

282
00:35:00,926 --> 00:35:04,664
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

283
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:12,356
You... You eat like a bird.

284
00:35:13,963 --> 00:35:16,919
And you'd know,
of course.

285
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,917
No, not really.

286
00:35:19,048 --> 00:35:22,481
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"...

287
00:35:22,568 --> 00:35:27,044
is really a fal...
false... falsity.

288
00:35:27,131 --> 00:35:30,781
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

289
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:37,691
But I really don't know anything about
birds. My hobby is stuffing things.

290
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:39,690
You know, taxidermy.

291
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:44,297
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because...

292
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:46,774
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

293
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,860
You know,
foxes and chimps.

294
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:53,074
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

295
00:35:53,162 --> 00:35:56,508
I think only birds
look well stuffed because...

296
00:35:56,638 --> 00:36:00,289
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

297
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,243
It's a strange hobby.
Curious.

298
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:06,851
- Uncommon too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

299
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:10,718
And it's... it's not as expensive
as you'd think. It's cheap, really.

300
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,500
You know, needles
and thread, sawdust.

301
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:16,063
The chemicals are the only
thing that, that cost anything.

302
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,106
A man should have a hobby.

303
00:36:19,192 --> 00:36:23,104
Well, it's...
it's more than a hobby.

304
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:28,449
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

305
00:36:28,535 --> 00:36:31,447
Is your time so empty?

306
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:34,141
No. Uh...

307
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:36,358
Well, I run the office...

308
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,792
and tend the cabins
and grounds...

309
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:41,703
and do little, uh,
errands for my mother...

310
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,571
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

311
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,787
Do you go out with friends?

312
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:52,654
Well, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

313
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:59,607
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

314
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,431
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

315
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,994
I didn't mean to pry.

316
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:11,776
I'm looking for
a private island.

317
00:37:13,904 --> 00:37:16,773
What are you
running away from?

318
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:22,639
- Why do you ask that?
- No.

319
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:25,116
People never run away
from anything.

320
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:31,896
The rain didn't last long,
did it? You know what I think?

321
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,547
I think that...

322
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:38,545
we're all in
our private traps...

323
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:43,934
clamped in them, and none of us
can ever get out.

324
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:47,931
We scratch and...
and claw...

325
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:51,930
but only at the air,
only at each other.

326
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:56,884
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

327
00:37:56,971 --> 00:37:59,448
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

328
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:05,054
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it any more.

329
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,530
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

330
00:38:08,617 --> 00:38:11,051
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

331
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:18,308
You know, if anyone ever talked
to me the way I heard...

332
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:22,046
the way she spoke to you...

333
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:26,130
Sometimes when she talks
to me like that...

334
00:38:26,218 --> 00:38:30,606
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and, and leave her forever.

335
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:33,083
Or at least defy her.

336
00:38:37,863 --> 00:38:41,949
But I know I can't.
She's ill.

337
00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:46,077
She sounded strong.

338
00:38:46,164 --> 00:38:48,684
No, I mean... ill.

339
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:54,029
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

340
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:57,810
I was only five and it,
it must've been quite a strain for her.

341
00:38:57,898 --> 00:39:01,765
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or
anything. He left her a little money.

342
00:39:01,852 --> 00:39:06,458
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

343
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,978
And he... he talked her
into building this motel.

344
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:13,064
He could have talked her
into anything.

345
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:17,235
And when he died too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

346
00:39:18,669 --> 00:39:20,669
And the way
he died...

347
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:27,101
I guess it's nothing
to talk about while you're eating.

348
00:39:27,187 --> 00:39:31,794
Anyway, it was just too great
a loss for her. She had nothing left.

349
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:34,227
Except you.

350
00:39:34,314 --> 00:39:37,573
Well, a son is a poor substitute
for a lover.

351
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:42,094
Why don't you go away?

352
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,353
To a private island,
like you?

353
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:51,306
No... not like me.

354
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,522
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

355
00:39:55,608 --> 00:39:58,476
She'd be alone up there.

356
00:40:00,302 --> 00:40:02,648
The fire would go out.

357
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:06,559
It'd be cold and damp
like a grave.

358
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,036
If you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them.

359
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:17,206
You understand, l...
I don't hate her.

360
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:21,378
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.

361
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:28,592
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her... some place?

362
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:36,154
You mean an institution?
A madhouse?

363
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:43,498
People always call
a madhouse "some place," don't they?

364
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:45,540
Put her in "some place."

365
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:50,190
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

366
00:40:50,278 --> 00:40:52,667
What do you know
about caring?

367
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,926
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

368
00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:59,751
The laughing and the tears...

369
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:02,184
and the cruel eyes
studying you.

370
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:04,227
My mother there?

371
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:09,312
But she's harmless.

372
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:13,787
She's as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds.

373
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,655
I am sorry.

374
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:21,914
I only felt...
It seems she's hurting you.

375
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:27,606
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

376
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:31,301
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest...

377
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:33,430
oh, so very delicately...

378
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:44,251
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

379
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:48,770
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.

380
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:58,070
It... It's not as if she were
a... a maniac, a raving thing.

381
00:41:58,157 --> 00:42:00,678
She...

382
00:42:00,764 --> 00:42:03,850
She just goes
a little mad sometimes.

383
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,282
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

384
00:42:10,716 --> 00:42:13,367
Haven't you?

385
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,539
Yes.

386
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:22,884
Sometimes just one time
can be enough. Thank you.

387
00:42:24,101 --> 00:42:26,056
Thank you, "Norman."

388
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,925
Norman.

389
00:42:29,011 --> 00:42:32,445
Oh, you're not... you're not
going back to your room already?

390
00:42:32,531 --> 00:42:35,269
I'm very tired.

391
00:42:35,357 --> 00:42:38,398
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

392
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:40,267
Really?

393
00:42:40,353 --> 00:42:43,700
I stepped into a private trap
back there...

394
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:48,350
and I'd like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it...

395
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,435
bef ore it's too late
for me too.

396
00:42:52,522 --> 00:42:55,911
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay a little while longer?

397
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:59,692
- I mean, just for talk.
- Oh, I'd like to, but...

398
00:42:59,779 --> 00:43:02,169
All right. Well,
I'll see you in the morning.

399
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:04,169
I'll bring you some breakfast,
all right?

400
00:43:04,255 --> 00:43:07,298
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

401
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,600
All right, Miss, uh...

402
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,686
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

403
00:43:11,773 --> 00:43:13,946
Good night.

404
00:47:20,956 --> 00:47:24,345
Ow! No!

405
00:47:24,432 --> 00:47:26,779
No! Aaah!

406
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,371
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

407
00:49:31,457 --> 00:49:35,021
Blood! Blood!

408
01:00:00,714 --> 01:00:03,105
I've tried many brands.

409
01:00:03,191 --> 01:00:06,972
So far, of those I've used, I haven't
had much luck with any of them.

410
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,971
Let's see what they say
about this one.

411
01:00:10,058 --> 01:00:12,448
They tell you
what its ingredients are...

412
01:00:12,578 --> 01:00:16,489
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world...

413
01:00:16,577 --> 01:00:19,401
but they do not tell you
whether it's painless.

414
01:00:19,488 --> 01:00:23,312
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

415
01:00:23,399 --> 01:00:27,310
This one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others.

416
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:41,087
Sam?

417
01:00:41,173 --> 01:00:44,172
Sam!
Lady wants to see ya.

418
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:52,690
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

419
01:00:52,776 --> 01:00:55,470
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

420
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,860
- Well, of course not. Something wrong?
-  Thank you.

421
01:01:03,771 --> 01:01:05,857
- She left home on Friday.

422
01:01:05,944 --> 01:01:09,420
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

423
01:01:09,507 --> 01:01:11,984
Not even
a phone call.

424
01:01:12,071 --> 01:01:15,505
If you two are in this together,
it's none of my business...

425
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:18,720
but I want Marion to tell me it's none
of my business and then I'll go...

426
01:01:18,807 --> 01:01:22,327
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will ya?

427
01:01:22,457 --> 01:01:25,455
- That's okay. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

428
01:01:30,323 --> 01:01:34,408
Now, what thing
could we be in together?

429
01:01:34,495 --> 01:01:36,581
Sorry about the tears.

430
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:39,927
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

431
01:01:40,014 --> 01:01:42,925
Let's all talk about
Marion, shall we?

432
01:01:46,533 --> 01:01:48,445
Who are you,
friend?

433
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:50,791
My name is Arbogast,
friend.

434
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:53,703
I'm a private
investigator.

435
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:57,440
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

436
01:01:57,527 --> 01:02:01,525
I know you don't, because if you did
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

437
01:02:01,612 --> 01:02:04,003
What's your interest
in this?

438
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:07,218
Well, $40,000.

439
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:10,477
- $40,000?
- That's right.

440
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:17,734
One of you'd better tell me what's going
on, and fast. I can take so much...

441
01:02:17,822 --> 01:02:19,734
Now, take it easy,
friend.

442
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,601
It's just that your girlfriend
stole $40,000.

443
01:02:23,689 --> 01:02:26,078
What are you talking about?
What is this?

444
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:30,641
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss, and she didn't.

445
01:02:30,729 --> 01:02:33,944
- No one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

446
01:02:34,031 --> 01:02:36,508
Someone always sees a girl
with $40,000.

447
01:02:36,595 --> 01:02:39,985
They don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

448
01:02:40,071 --> 01:02:42,983
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

449
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:46,807
Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come
up here on a hunch and nothing more?

450
01:02:46,937 --> 01:02:49,849
Oh, not even a hunch.
Just hope.

451
01:02:49,936 --> 01:02:53,630
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

452
01:02:53,717 --> 01:02:56,629
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

453
01:02:56,715 --> 01:02:59,844
All I want to do is see Marion
bef ore she gets in this too deeply.

454
01:02:59,932 --> 01:03:02,843
Did you check Phoenix?
Maybe she had an accident, or a hold-up.

455
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:08,057
No, she was seen leaving town in her
own car... by her employer, I might add.

456
01:03:08,145 --> 01:03:10,709
I can't believe it.
Can you?

457
01:03:12,273 --> 01:03:14,706
We're always quickest
to doubt people...

458
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:17,227
who have a reputation
for being honest.

459
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:19,574
I think she's here,
Miss Crane.

460
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:22,095
Where there's
a boyfriend...

461
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:27,092
She's not back there with the nuts and
bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.

462
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:30,090
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

463
01:04:06,899 --> 01:04:08,810
- Evening.
- Evening.

464
01:04:08,898 --> 01:04:10,810
I almost drove
right past.

465
01:04:10,896 --> 01:04:14,156
I'm always forgetting to turn
the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

466
01:04:14,243 --> 01:04:17,111
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.

467
01:04:17,198 --> 01:04:19,110
- Candy?
- No, thanks.

468
01:04:19,197 --> 01:04:23,108
Last two days I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon...

469
01:04:23,195 --> 01:04:26,628
but this is the first place that looks
like it's hiding from the world.

470
01:04:26,715 --> 01:04:29,627
To tell the truth, I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

471
01:04:29,714 --> 01:04:32,626
- Just doesn't seem like
any use any more.
- Oh?

472
01:04:32,712 --> 01:04:36,146
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

473
01:04:36,232 --> 01:04:39,144
- Wanna register?
- Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

474
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:42,143
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No trouble. Today's linen day.

475
01:04:42,229 --> 01:04:45,141
I always change the beds once a week
whether they've been used or not.

476
01:04:45,228 --> 01:04:49,791
Hate the smell of dampness. It's such
a, I don't know... creepy smell.

477
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:53,050
You out to buy
a motel?

478
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:56,483
No.

479
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:59,264
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen
so many the past couple of days...

480
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:01,177
I thought maybe...

481
01:05:01,263 --> 01:05:04,175
What, uh... What was it
you wanted to ask?

482
01:05:04,262 --> 01:05:06,783
I'm looking for
a missing person.

483
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:09,824
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

484
01:05:09,912 --> 01:05:12,345
I've been trying
to trace a girl...

485
01:05:12,431 --> 01:05:15,865
that's been missing for,
oh, about a week now from Phoenix.

486
01:05:15,951 --> 01:05:18,733
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

487
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,819
She's not
in any trouble.

488
01:05:20,906 --> 01:05:23,774
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

489
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:25,903
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

490
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:30,553
We have reason to believe she came
along this way. Did she stop here?

491
01:05:30,641 --> 01:05:33,552
No one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

492
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:35,551
Mind looking at the picture
bef ore committing yourself?

493
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:37,072
Commit myself?

494
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:40,505
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

495
01:05:42,113 --> 01:05:44,155
- Mm-mmm. Yeah.
- Sure?

496
01:05:45,285 --> 01:05:47,154
Well, she may have
used an alias.

497
01:05:47,284 --> 01:05:49,196
Marion Crane's
her real name...

498
01:05:49,284 --> 01:05:52,673
but she could've registered
under a different one.

499
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,888
I tell ya, I don't even much bother
with guests registering any more.

500
01:05:56,976 --> 01:05:59,886
One by one,
you drop the formalities.

501
01:05:59,974 --> 01:06:03,885
I shouldn't even bother changing
the sheets, but old habits die hard.

502
01:06:04,016 --> 01:06:05,797
Which reminds me...

503
01:06:07,753 --> 01:06:09,622
- What's that?
- The sign.

504
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:13,054
A couple last week said
if the thing hadn't been on...

505
01:06:13,142 --> 01:06:16,052
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

506
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,269
You see,
that's exactly my point.

507
01:06:18,356 --> 01:06:20,746
Nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks...

508
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:24,745
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

509
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:26,917
As you say,
old habits die hard.

510
01:06:27,004 --> 01:06:30,828
This girl could've registered
under another name. Mind if I look?

511
01:06:30,915 --> 01:06:33,131
- No.
- Thank you.

512
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,173
All right.

513
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,997
I'll get the date
somewhere. Mm-hmm.

514
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,561
See, there's nobody.

515
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:47,081
Let's see, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

516
01:06:48,428 --> 01:06:50,340
Oh, yes.

517
01:06:50,428 --> 01:06:52,339
Here we are.

518
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:54,339
- Marie Samuels.
- Hmm.

519
01:06:54,425 --> 01:06:56,337
That's an interesting
alias.

520
01:06:56,425 --> 01:06:58,858
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

521
01:06:58,945 --> 01:07:00,857
Marie, Marion.

522
01:07:00,944 --> 01:07:04,117
- Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
- Mm-hmm.

523
01:07:04,203 --> 01:07:08,983
Mm-hmm. Was she
in disguise, by any chance?

524
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:12,677
- Wanna check the picture again?
- I wasn't lying to you.

525
01:07:12,764 --> 01:07:15,676
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

526
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:17,631
It's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

527
01:07:17,718 --> 01:07:18,979
I know.

528
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:21,151
Oh, yeah.

529
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:26,366
Well, i-i-it was raining
and, um, her hair was all wet.

530
01:07:26,453 --> 01:07:28,366
I tell ya, it's not really
a very good picture of her.

531
01:07:28,496 --> 01:07:30,147
No, I guess not.

532
01:07:30,234 --> 01:07:32,146
Tell me all about her.

533
01:07:32,233 --> 01:07:34,319
Well, um...

534
01:07:34,405 --> 01:07:38,535
she arrived, um, rather late
one night, went straight to sleep...

535
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,142
and, uh, left early
the next morning.

536
01:07:41,229 --> 01:07:44,357
- How early?
- Oh, ex... very early.

537
01:07:44,444 --> 01:07:47,661
Mm-hmm.
Which morning was that?

538
01:07:47,747 --> 01:07:49,659
Uh, the, um...

539
01:07:49,746 --> 01:07:53,006
Th-Th-Th-The next morning.

540
01:07:53,092 --> 01:07:55,395
- Sunday.
- I see. Mm-hmm.

541
01:07:55,483 --> 01:07:57,395
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

542
01:07:57,481 --> 01:08:00,176
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

543
01:08:00,263 --> 01:08:03,044
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

544
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:05,043
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

545
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:09,041
- Did you spend the night with her?
- No.

546
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:12,387
Then how would you know
she didn't make any calls?

547
01:08:14,647 --> 01:08:16,689
Uh, w-w...

548
01:08:16,776 --> 01:08:19,036
Well, she was very tired
a-and, uh...

549
01:08:19,123 --> 01:08:21,861
See, l... N-Now I'm starting
to, um... remember.

550
01:08:21,948 --> 01:08:24,425
l-I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

551
01:08:24,512 --> 01:08:27,554
- If you make a mental picturization...
- Right. Take your time.

552
01:08:27,641 --> 01:08:30,813
Um, she was...
she was sitting back there...

553
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,812
N-No, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand.

554
01:08:33,898 --> 01:08:36,810
She said she had to
go to sleep early...

555
01:08:36,897 --> 01:08:41,025
because she had a long d-d-dr-drive,
uh, ahead of her.

556
01:08:41,113 --> 01:08:43,807
- Mm-hmm. Back where?
- Back where she came from.

557
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:46,588
No, you said bef ore she
was standing back there...

558
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,630
Yes, b-back in my parlour.

559
01:08:48,717 --> 01:08:51,629
She was very hungry,
I made her a sandwich...

560
01:08:51,715 --> 01:08:56,627
and then she said she was tired and
she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.

561
01:08:56,713 --> 01:08:58,625
I see.
How did she pay you?

562
01:08:58,713 --> 01:09:00,450
- Cash? Cheque?
- Cash.

563
01:09:00,538 --> 01:09:02,450
Cash, huh?
Mm-hmm.

564
01:09:02,536 --> 01:09:06,969
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Uh-uh. Why should she?

565
01:09:07,057 --> 01:09:09,142
Hmm.

566
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:15,140
Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh,
I guess that's about it.

567
01:09:15,226 --> 01:09:18,790
l-I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

568
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:21,788
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

569
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:25,221
See, if it doesn't jell,
it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.

570
01:09:25,351 --> 01:09:28,263
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

571
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:31,783
Well, l-l-I don't know
what you c-could expect me to know.

572
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:33,783
People just come and go,
you know.

573
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:36,302
That's right.
She isn't still here, is she?

574
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:38,171
No.

575
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:43,864
If I wanted to check the cabins, all
twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

576
01:09:43,952 --> 01:09:47,341
If you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

577
01:09:47,428 --> 01:09:49,383
Oh.
No, thanks.

578
01:10:06,418 --> 01:10:08,331
Uh, change your mind?

579
01:10:10,068 --> 01:10:11,981
Oh.

580
01:10:12,068 --> 01:10:15,849
You know, l... I think I have one of
those faces you can't help believing.

581
01:10:15,935 --> 01:10:17,760
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

582
01:10:17,848 --> 01:10:20,412
Oh? There's somebody
sitting in the window.

583
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:22,584
- N-N-No, there isn't.
- Sure. Take a look.

584
01:10:22,714 --> 01:10:24,670
Oh, th-that must be
my mother.

585
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,191
She's an, uh, "inavlid..."
an invalid.

586
01:10:27,277 --> 01:10:29,755
Uh, it's practically
like living alone.

587
01:10:29,842 --> 01:10:31,884
Oh, I see.

588
01:10:32,015 --> 01:10:36,708
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

589
01:10:36,795 --> 01:10:39,185
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

590
01:10:39,315 --> 01:10:41,271
No.

591
01:10:41,401 --> 01:10:46,139
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

592
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:48,267
You'd know
you were being used.

593
01:10:48,355 --> 01:10:51,353
- You wouldn't be made a fool of.
- I'm not a fool.

594
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,961
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

595
01:10:54,047 --> 01:10:57,002
- This is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

596
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:00,479
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

597
01:11:00,566 --> 01:11:03,478
Then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

598
01:11:03,564 --> 01:11:05,607
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

599
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:09,475
Just for a few minutes. There might be
some hint that you missed out on.

600
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:12,690
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

601
01:11:12,777 --> 01:11:14,690
- I wouldn't disturb her.
- Mr Arbogast, l-I think I've...

602
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:18,253
- I think I've talked to you all I want.
- Yes, but just for...

603
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,251
It'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

604
01:11:21,339 --> 01:11:23,337
Well, all right.

605
01:11:23,425 --> 01:11:27,292
You sure would save me a lot of
leg work if you'd let me talk to her.

606
01:11:27,379 --> 01:11:30,465
- Would I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

607
01:11:30,551 --> 01:11:32,463
All right.
Thanks, anyway.

608
01:12:26,872 --> 01:12:30,305
Hello, Loomis.
This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?

609
01:12:30,392 --> 01:12:32,782
Let me talk to her,
please.

610
01:12:34,128 --> 01:12:36,214
Hello, Lila.

611
01:12:36,302 --> 01:12:40,083
Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

612
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:43,081
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

613
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:45,080
It's out
on the old highway.

614
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:48,600
I even know what cabin she was in...
it was number one.

615
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:52,990
Well, this young fella that runs the
place said she just spent the night...

616
01:12:53,076 --> 01:12:55,770
left the next day
and that was it.

617
01:12:55,858 --> 01:12:59,247
Mmm.
Um, no, not exactly.

618
01:13:01,073 --> 01:13:02,984
Well, I did question him,
believe me...

619
01:13:03,071 --> 01:13:05,983
but I think I got
all there was to get.

620
01:13:06,069 --> 01:13:08,981
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

621
01:13:09,068 --> 01:13:12,501
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...

622
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,500
See, this boy
had a sick old mother.

623
01:13:15,586 --> 01:13:18,455
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

624
01:13:18,542 --> 01:13:21,844
No. No, unf ortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

625
01:13:21,932 --> 01:13:26,407
Well, I was, but I think I'll go
back to the motel first.

626
01:13:26,495 --> 01:13:30,276
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

627
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:32,274
All right, fine.
Listen, l...

628
01:13:32,362 --> 01:13:35,272
You'll be happy to know
what I think.

629
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,271
Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

630
01:13:40,836 --> 01:13:43,704
All right. See ya
in about an hour... or less.

631
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,702
All right, bye-bye.

632
01:14:41,371 --> 01:14:43,240
Bates?

633
01:17:16,556 --> 01:17:20,772
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely
sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

634
01:17:22,683 --> 01:17:25,595
Sam, he said
an hour or less.

635
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:27,942
Yeah.

636
01:17:28,029 --> 01:17:29,940
It's been three.

637
01:17:30,028 --> 01:17:32,114
Are we just
going to sit here and wait?

638
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,330
He'll be back.

639
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:36,894
Let's sit still
and hang on, okay?

640
01:17:41,804 --> 01:17:45,238
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

641
01:17:45,324 --> 01:17:47,758
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.
- Yes.

642
01:17:47,845 --> 01:17:50,105
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

643
01:17:50,192 --> 01:17:53,146
- That wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.

644
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:55,146
- I'm going out there.
- Arbogast said...

645
01:17:55,232 --> 01:17:57,145
An hour, or less.

646
01:18:00,752 --> 01:18:02,663
- Well, I'm going.

647
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,663
You'll never find it.

648
01:18:07,878 --> 01:18:10,313
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go?

649
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:14,310
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

650
01:18:14,397 --> 01:18:16,831
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

651
01:18:16,918 --> 01:18:18,482
Yeah. Stay here.

652
01:18:38,776 --> 01:18:40,689
Arbogast?

653
01:18:41,775 --> 01:18:43,688
Arbogast!

654
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:48,468
Arbogast!

655
01:19:17,801 --> 01:19:20,408
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

656
01:19:20,495 --> 01:19:23,798
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

657
01:19:23,885 --> 01:19:27,101
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door... or unwilling.

658
01:19:27,188 --> 01:19:29,099
Where could he
have gone?

659
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:31,099
Maybe he got
some definite lead.

660
01:19:31,229 --> 01:19:33,141
- Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?

661
01:19:33,229 --> 01:19:35,140
- In a hurry.
- Sam, he called...

662
01:19:35,227 --> 01:19:37,140
when he had nothing
but a dissatisfied feeling.

663
01:19:37,226 --> 01:19:41,137
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

664
01:19:41,224 --> 01:19:43,137
Yes, I think
he would've.

665
01:19:43,223 --> 01:19:45,440
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

666
01:19:45,526 --> 01:19:48,960
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- Let me get my coat.

667
01:19:57,217 --> 01:19:59,129
Good evening.

668
01:19:59,215 --> 01:20:03,300
Well, l... I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

669
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:05,300
Yes.

670
01:20:05,386 --> 01:20:08,298
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

671
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:11,297
She's been here
searching for her sister.

672
01:20:11,383 --> 01:20:13,295
There's this
private detective helping.

673
01:20:13,383 --> 01:20:16,077
We got a call from this
detective... he'd traced her...

674
01:20:16,163 --> 01:20:18,032
to that motel
on the old highway.

675
01:20:18,119 --> 01:20:20,032
That must be
the Bates Motel.

676
01:20:20,118 --> 01:20:23,161
He called to say he was going
to question Mrs Bates.

677
01:20:23,247 --> 01:20:25,159
Norman took a wife?

678
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:28,636
No, l-I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

679
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:31,765
That was early this evening. We
haven't seen or heard from him since.

680
01:20:31,808 --> 01:20:35,416
Now, your sister's
missing how long?

681
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:38,501
She left Phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace.

682
01:20:38,587 --> 01:20:42,238
How'd you and this detective come
to trace her to Fairvale?

683
01:20:42,325 --> 01:20:44,498
They thought
she'd be coming to me.

684
01:20:44,584 --> 01:20:47,019
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

685
01:20:47,105 --> 01:20:49,017
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

686
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:51,016
That's right.

687
01:20:51,103 --> 01:20:53,016
From what?

688
01:20:54,753 --> 01:20:56,666
She stole some money.

689
01:20:56,796 --> 01:20:58,752
A lot?

690
01:20:58,882 --> 01:21:00,838
Forty thousand dollars.

691
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:02,880
The police haven't
been able to...

692
01:21:03,010 --> 01:21:06,574
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back...

693
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:09,573
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

694
01:21:09,659 --> 01:21:11,571
That explains
the private detective.

695
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:13,657
He traced her
to the Bates place.

696
01:21:13,745 --> 01:21:16,656
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

697
01:21:16,743 --> 01:21:20,045
He said Marion was there
for one night, then she left.

698
01:21:20,133 --> 01:21:22,045
- With the $40,000?
- He didn't say anything...

699
01:21:22,131 --> 01:21:24,565
about the money.

700
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:27,042
It isn't important
what he said, is it?

701
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:30,910
He was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

702
01:21:30,996 --> 01:21:32,909
That's what I want you
to do something about.

703
01:21:32,996 --> 01:21:34,386
Like what?

704
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:36,907
I'm sorry if
I seem overanxious.

705
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:40,731
I'm sure there's something wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

706
01:21:40,818 --> 01:21:44,599
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, Miss, but not the same thing.

707
01:21:44,685 --> 01:21:47,597
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

708
01:21:47,684 --> 01:21:51,769
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was goin'...

709
01:21:51,856 --> 01:21:53,811
probably from Norman Bates...

710
01:21:53,899 --> 01:21:57,158
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

711
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:01,634
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

712
01:22:01,721 --> 01:22:04,285
Call Norman and let him
say what happened.

713
01:22:04,371 --> 01:22:06,415
At this hour?

714
01:22:06,501 --> 01:22:10,412
He was out when I was there a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.

715
01:22:10,499 --> 01:22:15,366
He wasn't out; he just wasn't answerin'
the door in the dead of night
like some people do.

716
01:22:15,453 --> 01:22:18,321
This fellow lives
like a hermit.

717
01:22:18,409 --> 01:22:21,189
You must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago.

718
01:22:21,277 --> 01:22:23,189
Please. Call.

719
01:22:28,708 --> 01:22:32,836
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

720
01:22:39,007 --> 01:22:42,092
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

721
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:45,135
Ye... I been
just fine, thanks.

722
01:22:45,221 --> 01:22:47,785
Listen, we got
worries here.

723
01:22:47,873 --> 01:22:51,262
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

724
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:54,955
Well, this one
wouldn't be a customer.

725
01:22:55,043 --> 01:22:58,084
- A private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

726
01:22:58,172 --> 01:23:00,084
Arbogast.

727
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:04,516
And after he left?

728
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:09,384
No, that's...
that's okay, Norman.

729
01:23:12,122 --> 01:23:15,032
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl...

730
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,031
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

731
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:21,421
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

732
01:23:21,508 --> 01:23:24,419
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back...

733
01:23:24,507 --> 01:23:27,939
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

734
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,939
Yes.

735
01:23:30,069 --> 01:23:32,893
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

736
01:23:32,981 --> 01:23:37,109
in Greenlawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

737
01:23:37,196 --> 01:23:40,803
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

738
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,801
'Tain't only
local history, Sam.

739
01:23:42,889 --> 01:23:46,756
It's the only case of murder
and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

740
01:23:46,843 --> 01:23:50,624
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy
she was... involved with...

741
01:23:50,711 --> 01:23:53,145
when she found out
he was married...

742
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:56,448
then took a helpin' of
the same stuff herself.

743
01:23:56,534 --> 01:24:00,141
Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.

744
01:24:00,228 --> 01:24:02,966
Norman found them
dead together.

745
01:24:03,053 --> 01:24:05,921
In bed.

746
01:24:06,008 --> 01:24:08,442
You mean that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window wasn't Bates' mother?

747
01:24:08,528 --> 01:24:13,091
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

748
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:15,525
Yes! In the house
behind the motel!

749
01:24:15,612 --> 01:24:17,829
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

750
01:24:17,915 --> 01:24:20,392
You saw
Norman Bates' mother?

751
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:24,129
But it had to be...
because Arbogast said so too!

752
01:24:24,217 --> 01:24:27,867
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

753
01:24:27,954 --> 01:24:31,865
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs Bates...

754
01:24:31,951 --> 01:24:35,602
who's that woman buried
out in Greenlawn Cemetery?

755
01:25:18,233 --> 01:25:22,405
Now, Mother, um...
l-I'm gonna bring something up...

756
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:25,056
I am sorry, boy...

757
01:25:25,143 --> 01:25:28,750
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

758
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:30,749
Please, Mother.

759
01:25:30,836 --> 01:25:34,008
No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

760
01:25:34,096 --> 01:25:37,267
Ha! You think
I'm fruity, huh?

761
01:25:37,355 --> 01:25:39,397
I'm staying right here.

762
01:25:39,484 --> 01:25:42,352
This is my room and
no one will drag me out of it...

763
01:25:42,439 --> 01:25:44,916
least of all
my big, bold son.

764
01:25:45,003 --> 01:25:46,915
They'll come now, Mother.

765
01:25:47,002 --> 01:25:50,783
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

766
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:54,998
Mother, please, it's just for
a few days so they won't find you.

767
01:25:55,085 --> 01:25:57,258
Just for a few days?

768
01:25:57,344 --> 01:26:01,125
In that dark, dank
fruit cellar? No!

769
01:26:01,213 --> 01:26:04,602
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

770
01:26:04,689 --> 01:26:07,644
Now get out!

771
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:11,512
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

772
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:14,641
Norman, what do you
think you're doing?

773
01:26:14,728 --> 01:26:18,291
Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!

774
01:26:23,419 --> 01:26:26,591
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

775
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,848
Wonderful sermon today.

776
01:26:33,936 --> 01:26:36,413
- Good morning.
-  Good morning.

777
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,716
We thought we'd drive out
to that motel with you.

778
01:26:38,846 --> 01:26:41,149
- He's already been.
- Went out bef ore service.

779
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:43,844
- Did you two have breakfast?
- Didn't find anything?

780
01:26:43,931 --> 01:26:47,537
Nothing. Let's
clear the way here.

781
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:49,928
What did he say
about my sister?

782
01:26:50,014 --> 01:26:53,274
Just what he told your detective:
She used a fake name.

783
01:26:53,361 --> 01:26:57,576
Saw the register myself. Saw the
whole place. That boy's alone there.

784
01:26:57,706 --> 01:27:00,618
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

785
01:27:00,705 --> 01:27:03,095
I know you're not
the seein'-illusions type...

786
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:06,050
but no woman was there and I don't
believe in ghosts, so there it is.

787
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,049
I still feel
there's something...

788
01:27:08,136 --> 01:27:11,700
Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't
make you feel better.

789
01:27:11,786 --> 01:27:16,219
Come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft.

790
01:27:16,306 --> 01:27:19,175
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law...

791
01:27:19,261 --> 01:27:22,737
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister bein' picked up.

792
01:27:22,825 --> 01:27:24,867
How 'bout that?

793
01:27:24,954 --> 01:27:28,040
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

794
01:27:28,126 --> 01:27:32,342
Come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.

795
01:27:32,429 --> 01:27:34,340
You too, Sam.

796
01:27:34,428 --> 01:27:37,339
Thank you.

797
01:27:37,427 --> 01:27:42,337
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

798
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:45,596
- You want me to drop you at the hotel...
- Sam.

799
01:27:45,683 --> 01:27:50,333
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

800
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:53,593
Neither will I.
Come on.

801
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:57,764
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

802
01:27:57,851 --> 01:28:00,067
We're going to register
as man and wife.

803
01:28:00,154 --> 01:28:03,327
We're going to
get shown to a cabin...

804
01:28:03,413 --> 01:28:06,977
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

805
01:28:30,357 --> 01:28:33,268
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

806
01:28:33,356 --> 01:28:35,268
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

807
01:28:35,354 --> 01:28:36,485
Come on.

808
01:28:39,787 --> 01:28:42,177
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

809
01:28:42,264 --> 01:28:44,177
Uh-huh.
Suppose you want a room.

810
01:28:44,263 --> 01:28:46,696
We were gonna try to make it
to San Francisco...

811
01:28:46,784 --> 01:28:49,173
but we don't like the look
of that sky.

812
01:28:49,304 --> 01:28:52,216
Looks like a bad day coming,
doesn't it?

813
01:28:59,082 --> 01:29:01,516
- I'll take you to cabin ten.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

814
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:03,514
That's not necessary.

815
01:29:03,602 --> 01:29:07,295
My boss is paying for this trip
and, uh, well, it's 90%business.

816
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:10,163
He wants practically
notarized receipts.

817
01:29:10,251 --> 01:29:13,205
I'd better sign in
and get a receipt.

818
01:29:31,023 --> 01:29:32,935
Thank you.

819
01:29:35,325 --> 01:29:37,238
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

820
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,886
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

821
01:29:43,973 --> 01:29:45,885
You check in any other place
in this country without bags...

822
01:29:45,972 --> 01:29:49,884
- and you have to pay in advance.
- Ten dollars.

823
01:29:56,489 --> 01:29:58,835
That receipt.

824
01:30:03,703 --> 01:30:06,310
I'll go on ahead.

825
01:30:11,004 --> 01:30:13,958
All right, there's
your receipt. I'll show you the cabin.

826
01:30:14,045 --> 01:30:16,913
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

827
01:30:35,426 --> 01:30:37,730
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it...

828
01:30:37,816 --> 01:30:40,771
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

829
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:42,770
I know.

830
01:30:42,857 --> 01:30:44,770
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

831
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,768
I don't know, but if you had...

832
01:30:46,856 --> 01:30:50,288
a useless business like this motel,
what would you need to get out?

833
01:30:50,376 --> 01:30:53,722
To get a new business somewhere else?
Forty thousand dollars?

834
01:30:56,546 --> 01:30:58,632
How could we prove that...

835
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:01,500
If he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

836
01:31:01,588 --> 01:31:03,804
There must be some proof
that exists now...

837
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:07,106
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

838
01:31:07,194 --> 01:31:12,148
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

839
01:31:12,234 --> 01:31:14,146
Or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel...

840
01:31:14,276 --> 01:31:15,841
the same way about you.

841
01:31:15,928 --> 01:31:18,666
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

842
01:31:18,753 --> 01:31:21,186
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us...

843
01:31:21,274 --> 01:31:22,664
unless he was stopped.

844
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:26,531
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

845
01:31:28,878 --> 01:31:31,529
We'll start with cabin one.

846
01:31:33,398 --> 01:31:36,527
If he sees us,
we're just taking the air.

847
01:32:08,511 --> 01:32:10,466
Bates.

848
01:32:59,138 --> 01:33:01,094
No shower curtain.

849
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:03,658
- Sam! Look!
- Huh? What is it?

850
01:33:03,788 --> 01:33:05,918
It's figuring. It didn't
get washed down. Look.

851
01:33:06,004 --> 01:33:09,915
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

852
01:33:10,046 --> 01:33:12,480
That proves Marion was here.
It'd be too wild a coincidence...

853
01:33:12,567 --> 01:33:14,478
Bates never denied she was here.

854
01:33:14,566 --> 01:33:17,695
Oh. Doesn't that prove
he found out about the money?

855
01:33:17,782 --> 01:33:20,389
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

856
01:33:20,476 --> 01:33:23,822
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

857
01:33:23,909 --> 01:33:27,255
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

858
01:33:27,342 --> 01:33:29,559
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

859
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:31,557
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

860
01:33:31,645 --> 01:33:34,816
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

861
01:33:34,904 --> 01:33:38,163
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

862
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:41,205
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

863
01:33:41,292 --> 01:33:43,204
I can handle a sick old woman.

864
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:46,202
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

865
01:33:47,245 --> 01:33:49,201
Wait a minute.

866
01:33:49,288 --> 01:33:52,547
If you get anything
out of the mother...

867
01:33:52,634 --> 01:33:54,807
can you find your way
back to town?

868
01:33:54,893 --> 01:33:57,197
Yes, of course.

869
01:33:57,284 --> 01:34:00,674
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

870
01:34:23,489 --> 01:34:26,052
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

871
01:34:26,183 --> 01:34:28,312
Wife's taking a nap and...

872
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:32,354
I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I thought I'd look you up and talk.

873
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,743
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

874
01:35:48,882 --> 01:35:51,836
I've been doing all the talking
so far, haven't I?

875
01:35:51,924 --> 01:35:54,357
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time...

876
01:35:54,444 --> 01:35:56,790
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

877
01:35:56,921 --> 01:35:59,007
Here you are
doing all the listening.

878
01:35:59,094 --> 01:36:01,571
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

879
01:36:01,658 --> 01:36:04,222
Drive me crazy.

880
01:36:04,309 --> 01:36:07,264
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

881
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:12,435
Just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do anything to get away.

882
01:36:12,565 --> 01:36:14,521
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

883
01:36:18,562 --> 01:36:21,735
- Mrs Bates?

884
01:37:38,610 --> 01:37:41,131
I'm not saying you
shouldn't be contented here...

885
01:37:41,218 --> 01:37:43,130
I'm just doubting that you are.

886
01:37:43,261 --> 01:37:46,824
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under you'd unload this place.

887
01:37:46,911 --> 01:37:50,822
This place? This place happens
to be my only world.

888
01:37:50,909 --> 01:37:53,821
I grew up in that house.
I had a very happy childhood.

889
01:37:53,907 --> 01:37:56,559
My mother and I
were more than happy.

890
01:38:58,397 --> 01:39:00,788
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

891
01:39:00,874 --> 01:39:02,787
I don't know
what you've been saying.

892
01:39:02,874 --> 01:39:06,003
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

893
01:39:06,089 --> 01:39:08,263
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

894
01:39:08,349 --> 01:39:11,087
Buy a new one in a new town where you
won't have to hide your mother.

895
01:39:11,174 --> 01:39:14,042
Why don't you just get in
your car and drive away?

896
01:39:14,129 --> 01:39:17,997
Where will you get the money to do that?
Or do you already have it socked away?

897
01:39:18,127 --> 01:39:21,343
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.

898
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:28,296
I bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it.

899
01:39:28,383 --> 01:39:32,077
I think
she'll tell us.

900
01:39:32,163 --> 01:39:35,771
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

901
01:40:40,608 --> 01:40:42,955
Mrs Bates, it's...

902
01:41:02,424 --> 01:41:06,552
Norman Bates!

903
01:41:34,842 --> 01:41:38,493
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

904
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:41,274
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

905
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:43,360
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

906
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:47,315
Did he talk
to you?

907
01:41:47,358 --> 01:41:50,270
No.

908
01:41:50,357 --> 01:41:55,398
I got the whole story, but not from
Norman. I got it from his "mother."

909
01:41:56,658 --> 01:42:00,222
Norman Bates
no longer exists.

910
01:42:00,309 --> 01:42:03,003
He only half-existed
to begin with.

911
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:07,174
And now the other half
has taken over...

912
01:42:07,262 --> 01:42:09,826
probably for all time.

913
01:42:11,564 --> 01:42:13,563
Did he kill my sister?

914
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:17,170
Yes... and no.

915
01:42:17,257 --> 01:42:19,908
Now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork...

916
01:42:19,995 --> 01:42:22,689
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop...

917
01:42:22,776 --> 01:42:25,861
A psychiatrist
doesn't lay the groundwork.

918
01:42:25,948 --> 01:42:28,338
He merely tries
to explain it.

919
01:42:28,425 --> 01:42:31,424
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

920
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:38,377
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

921
01:42:38,464 --> 01:42:42,288
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

922
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:49,154
Uh, have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books?

923
01:42:49,242 --> 01:42:52,413
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

924
01:42:52,501 --> 01:42:55,542
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said...

925
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:57,542
the "mother."

926
01:42:59,367 --> 01:43:03,364
To understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the "mother"...

927
01:43:03,495 --> 01:43:07,015
that is from the "mother" half
of Norman's mind...

928
01:43:07,102 --> 01:43:10,057
you have to go back
ten years...

929
01:43:10,144 --> 01:43:12,621
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

930
01:43:12,751 --> 01:43:17,793
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been since his father died.

931
01:43:19,488 --> 01:43:24,093
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman...

932
01:43:24,181 --> 01:43:28,092
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

933
01:43:29,613 --> 01:43:32,090
Then she met a man...

934
01:43:32,176 --> 01:43:36,609
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

935
01:43:36,697 --> 01:43:40,086
That pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

936
01:43:40,173 --> 01:43:44,345
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all...

937
01:43:46,214 --> 01:43:50,081
most unbearable
to the son who commits it.

938
01:43:50,168 --> 01:43:55,513
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

939
01:43:57,903 --> 01:44:00,380
He stole her corpse.

940
01:44:02,249 --> 01:44:05,334
A weighted coffin
was buried.

941
01:44:05,421 --> 01:44:08,289
He hid the body
in the fruit cellar...

942
01:44:08,377 --> 01:44:11,462
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

943
01:44:11,548 --> 01:44:14,330
And that still
wasn't enough.

944
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:18,155
She was there...
but she was a corpse.

945
01:44:20,674 --> 01:44:23,456
So he began to think
and speak for her...

946
01:44:23,543 --> 01:44:26,585
give her half his life,
so to speak.

947
01:44:26,671 --> 01:44:31,278
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

948
01:44:31,365 --> 01:44:35,667
At other times, the "mother" half
took over completely.

949
01:44:35,755 --> 01:44:40,318
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only "Mother"...

950
01:44:42,099 --> 01:44:45,663
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her...

951
01:44:45,749 --> 01:44:48,401
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him.

952
01:44:48,487 --> 01:44:53,789
Theref ore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman...

953
01:44:53,876 --> 01:44:57,569
the "mother" side of him
would go wild.

954
01:44:59,916 --> 01:45:02,872
When he met your sister...

955
01:45:02,958 --> 01:45:05,522
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

956
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:08,390
He wanted her.

957
01:45:08,478 --> 01:45:12,345
That set off the jealous "mother"
and "Mother" killed the girl.

958
01:45:14,996 --> 01:45:19,299
After the murder Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep...

959
01:45:19,385 --> 01:45:23,079
and, like a dutiful son, covered up
all traces of the crime...

960
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:25,556
he was convinced
his "mother" had committed!

961
01:45:25,643 --> 01:45:28,120
Why was he...
dressed like that?

962
01:45:28,207 --> 01:45:31,075
He's a transvestite.

963
01:45:31,162 --> 01:45:33,813
Uh, not exactly.

964
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:37,463
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change...

965
01:45:37,551 --> 01:45:39,767
or satisf action,
is a transvestite.

966
01:45:39,853 --> 01:45:44,069
But in Norman's case, he was simply
doing everything possible...

967
01:45:44,156 --> 01:45:47,371
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

968
01:45:48,805 --> 01:45:51,848
And when reality
came to close...

969
01:45:51,934 --> 01:45:55,498
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion...

970
01:45:57,888 --> 01:46:00,930
he dressed up, even to
a cheap wig he bought.

971
01:46:01,017 --> 01:46:04,971
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

972
01:46:05,059 --> 01:46:07,275
He tried to be
his mother.

973
01:46:08,882 --> 01:46:12,011
And, uh, now he is.

974
01:46:12,099 --> 01:46:17,096
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the "mother."

975
01:46:17,183 --> 01:46:21,094
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities...

976
01:46:21,181 --> 01:46:24,701
there's always
a conflict, a battle.

977
01:46:24,788 --> 01:46:28,438
In Norman's case,
the battle is over...

978
01:46:28,526 --> 01:46:30,654
and the dominant personality
has won.

979
01:46:30,742 --> 01:46:34,826
And the $40,000?
Who got that?

980
01:46:34,914 --> 01:46:38,651
The swamp. These were
crimes of passion, not profit.

981
01:46:40,432 --> 01:46:43,127
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

982
01:46:44,474 --> 01:46:46,429
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

983
01:46:59,032 --> 01:47:01,422
Thank you.

984
01:47:08,071 --> 01:47:11,027
It's sad when
a mother has to speak the words...

985
01:47:11,113 --> 01:47:13,373
that condemn her own son...

986
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:17,241
but I couldn't allow them
to believe that I would commit murder.

987
01:47:17,327 --> 01:47:21,717
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

988
01:47:21,804 --> 01:47:24,672
He was always bad,
and in the end...

989
01:47:24,758 --> 01:47:29,235
he intended to tell them I killed
those girls and that man...

990
01:47:29,321 --> 01:47:32,972
as if I could do anything
except sit and stare...

991
01:47:33,059 --> 01:47:36,058
like one
of his stuffed birds.

992
01:47:36,144 --> 01:47:39,664
They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

993
01:47:39,795 --> 01:47:45,357
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

994
01:47:48,399 --> 01:47:52,180
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

995
01:47:52,267 --> 01:47:56,047
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

996
01:47:56,135 --> 01:47:58,438
I'm not even
gonna swat that fly.

997
01:47:58,524 --> 01:48:01,914
I hope they are watching.
They'll see.

998
01:48:02,002 --> 01:48:03,913
They'll see
and they'll know...

999
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,694
and they'll say, "Why, she
wouldn't even harm a fly."
