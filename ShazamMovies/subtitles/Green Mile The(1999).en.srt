1
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,014
Katie!

2
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,094
Cora!

3
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:56,792
You love your sister?

4
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:59,449
You make any noise,
you know what happens.

5
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,463
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,175
-How am I looking, Paul?
-That's better. That's better.

7
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,169
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

8
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,732
Some Danish?

9
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:10,964
No, just two pieces of
dry toast, Hector. Thanks.

10
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,508
Leftover's fine.

11
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,809
Dry and cold, same as always.

12
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:15,990
Cold is better.

13
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,317
Especially on those long walks.

14
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,878
Am I right?

15
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:26,683
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

16
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,917
We're not supposed to
let you wander off.

17
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,803
Where do you go every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

18
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,846
Just walk.

19
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:39,859
I like to walk.

20
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:44,185
Try not to fall down, bust a hip.

21
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:47,100
I don't wanna be in no
damn search party.

22
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:58,271
You want this man in your life?
Explain the moral basis of that.

23
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:59,479
i've made mistakes.

24
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:02,490
Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.

25
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:05,617
You can't ask nothing.
i have six kids myself.

26
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,242
Why do we always watch this stuff?

27
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,390
It's interesting.

28
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,540
Interesting?
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

29
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,188
All they ever talk about is fucking.

30
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,108
Are you all right?

31
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:45,686
You look tired. You're not yourself.

32
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,438
No, I'm fine. I promise.

33
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:52,380
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day, I think.

34
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:54,432
Not that you asked me.

35
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:57,463
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

36
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:01,596
I had a few bad dreams. It happens.

37
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:03,380
I'll be fine.

38
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,073
if Madge doesn't care,
i certainly don't.

39
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:15,349
Neither do i.

40
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,072
Now, this here is worth a look.

41
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,659
i'm in heaven

42
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,547
And my heart beats so
That i can hardly speak

43
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,808
And i seem to find

44
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,548
The happiness i seek

45
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:37,886
When we're out together

46
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,945
Dancing cheek to cheek

47
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,708
Heaven

48
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:46,622
i'm in heaven

49
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:50,008
And the cares that hung around me

50
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,885
Through the week

51
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,775
Seem to vanish

52
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:57,939
Like a gambler's lucky streak

53
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:03,032
Paul, what is it?

54
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:06,753
My God.

55
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,975
I've got to get out of here.

56
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:38,382
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you...

57
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:41,556
...whether you want it to or not.
It's silly.

58
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,143
Was it the film? It was, wasn't it?

59
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:50,591
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

60
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,125
Over 60 years.

61
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:55,002
Paul, I'm your friend.

62
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:02,971
I ever tell you that I was
a prison guard during the Depression?

63
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:04,957
You've mentioned it.

64
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,180
Did I mention I was
in charge of death row?

65
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:10,519
That I supervised all the executions?

66
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:19,256
Usually, death row is called
"The Last Mile."

67
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,951
We called ours "The Green Mile."

68
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:25,528
The floor was the color
of faded limes.

69
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:28,885
We had the electric chair.

70
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,034
"Old Sparky," we called it.

71
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,059
I've lived a lot of years, Ellie...

72
00:08:36,826 --> 00:08:40,508
...but 1 935, that takes the prize.

73
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,481
That year, I had...

74
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:46,809
...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

75
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,821
It was....

76
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:52,986
It was also the year of...

77
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,575
...John Coffey...

78
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,009
...and the two dead girls.

79
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:12,471
Put me through to E Block.

80
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:27,259
E Block.

81
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:30,587
Right.

82
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:53,048
Paul? Prisoner.

83
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:54,773
Christ, give me a minute.

84
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,305
You all right?

85
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:07,644
For a man pissing razorblades, yeah.

86
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,832
You should've took the day off
to see the doctor.

87
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,643
With the new arrival?
You know better.

88
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,656
Besides...

89
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,502
...it's not as bad as it was.
I think it's clearing up.

90
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:37,239
-Let's look alive, Dean.
-Yes, sir.

91
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:45,497
Damn.

92
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:48,662
They're riding on the axle.

93
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,259
What'd they do?

94
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:01,177
They bust the springs?

95
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,056
Dead man!

96
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:13,396
Dead man walking!

97
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:16,982
We got a dead man walking here!

98
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:20,176
Jesus please us,
what is he yelling about?

99
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,963
You might reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

100
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:29,527
He's enormous.

101
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:31,608
Can't be bigger than you.

102
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:42,934
Dead man!

103
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:45,178
Dead man walking!

104
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,779
Dead man!

105
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,438
Dead man walking!

106
00:12:49,465 --> 00:12:51,478
Dead man walking here!

107
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:53,943
Dead man!

108
00:12:57,473 --> 00:12:59,189
We got a dead man walking here!

109
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:01,942
Dead man walking!

110
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:06,583
-We got a dead man walking here!
-Percy.

111
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:09,173
That's enough.

112
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:33,753
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

113
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:39,670
Can you talk?

114
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:48,849
Yes, sir, boss. I can talk.

115
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,883
Move your ass.

116
00:13:58,497 --> 00:13:59,503
Let's go.

117
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:01,335
Come on.

118
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,319
Percy...

119
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,319
...they're moving house
in the infirmary.

120
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:14,685
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help?

121
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:16,978
They got all the men they need.

122
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,193
Why don't you just make sure?

123
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,464
I don't care where you go, as long as
it's not here at this moment.

124
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,806
All right.

125
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:45,432
God, you bust my finger.

126
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:47,925
I wiped that grin
off your face, didn't l?

127
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:50,361
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

128
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:03,864
Fuck you, Percy.

129
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:07,154
We'll get that looked at, Del.
In the meantime, stay quiet.

130
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,121
I let Harry take those chains off you...

131
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:17,876
...you gonna be nice?

132
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,791
Your name is John Coffey.

133
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,719
Yes, sir, boss.

134
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:41,267
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

135
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:43,003
You can spell, can you?

136
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,455
Just my name, boss.

137
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,429
J...O--

138
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:51,711
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

139
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:55,259
If I'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger...

140
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:58,415
...Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton.
These gentlemen right there.

141
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:01,944
Questions?

142
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:04,955
Do you leave the light on
after bedtime?

143
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:10,901
Because I get a little scared
in the dark sometime...

144
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:14,037
...if it's a strange place.

145
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,544
It stays pretty bright around here
all night long.

146
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,239
We keep a few lights burning
in the corridor.

147
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:28,212
The corridor?

148
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:31,099
Right out there.

149
00:16:58,106 --> 00:16:59,602
You can sit.

150
00:17:20,988 --> 00:17:23,260
I couldn't help it, boss.

151
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,780
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

152
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:36,591
Take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

153
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:39,248
Of course they are.
I heard the bones crack.

154
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,135
You hear what he was yelling
when we brought the dummy in?

155
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:44,215
How could I miss it?
The whole prison heard.

156
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,230
Goddamn Percy.

157
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,759
You'll have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

158
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:52,780
I'll chew that food when I have to.

159
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:57,277
Right now I wanna hear about this
new inmate. Aside from how big he is.

160
00:17:57,854 --> 00:18:00,059
Monstrous big. Damn.

161
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:02,159
He seems meek enough.

162
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:04,058
Is he retarded, you figure?

163
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:07,031
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

164
00:18:07,223 --> 00:18:10,387
Imbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

165
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:15,759
Make your blood curdle.

166
00:18:38,622 --> 00:18:42,582
-What?! For God's sake, what?
-The girls! The girls are gone!

167
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,103
Papa! Papa, look! There's blood.

168
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,990
Oh, my God.

169
00:18:57,017 --> 00:19:00,881
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone.
You tell them we headed west.

170
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,046
You mind what I'm saying!
We headed west!

171
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:06,588
Central! Are you on the line?

172
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,769
Oh, God, please.
Somebody took my little girls.

173
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,381
IKatie!

174
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:25,807
Cora!

175
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:57,042
Jesus.

176
00:19:57,983 --> 00:19:59,411
Jesus.

177
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,159
I'll kill you!

178
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:16,376
I'll kill you!

179
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:45,589
I couldn't help it.

180
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:50,039
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

181
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,560
Boy, you under arrest for murder.

182
00:20:58,527 --> 00:20:59,984
I interrupt?

183
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,051
Well, I'm just about done.

184
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,786
How's your pretty gal?

185
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:20,786
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

186
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:22,608
Not so well at all.

187
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,753
More headaches?

188
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:28,851
Got laid up with another one yesterday.

189
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:30,836
Worst one yet.

190
00:21:31,518 --> 00:21:35,315
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

191
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,930
Head x-rays and who knows what else.

192
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,778
She is scared to death.

193
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:45,682
Truth to tell, so am l.

194
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,653
If it's something they can see
on the x-ray...

195
00:21:50,238 --> 00:21:51,954
...maybe they can fix it.

196
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:54,131
Maybe.

197
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,087
This just came in.

198
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,551
DOE on Bitterbuck.

199
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:07,827
You didn't come down here
to hand me a DOE.

200
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:12,718
I had an angry call from the
state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

201
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:15,508
Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore
off the block?

202
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,947
It is.

203
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,205
Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

204
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:25,051
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

205
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,036
...and his name is Percy Wetmore.

206
00:22:27,257 --> 00:22:29,079
Little Percy calls his aunt...

207
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:32,627
...and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

208
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:38,132
He mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

209
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:40,952
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

210
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:43,665
I didn't hear that.
I'm sure she didn't either.

211
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:45,689
He is mean, careless and stupid...

212
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:48,537
...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

213
00:22:48,797 --> 00:22:51,213
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

214
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:52,700
Stick with it, Paul.

215
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:54,579
It may not be much longer.

216
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:59,029
I have it on good authority that Percy
has an application in at Briar Ridge.

217
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:01,782
Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.

218
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:03,259
Administration job.

219
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:04,889
Better pay.

220
00:23:06,462 --> 00:23:08,437
Then why is he still here?

221
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:12,465
He can get that application
pushed through.

222
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:17,749
With his connections, he could have
any state job he wants.

223
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:20,119
You know what I think?

224
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:25,490
I think he just wants to
see one cook up close.

225
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,144
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

226
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:36,978
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. In the meantime...

227
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:38,878
...you'll keep the peace?

228
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,307
Of course.

229
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:42,838
Of course.

230
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:45,744
Thank you, Paul.

231
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:50,549
Hal...

232
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,972
...you give Melinda my love, okay?

233
00:23:54,462 --> 00:23:58,518
I'm sure that x-ray will turn out
to be nothing at all.

234
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,012
You bet.

235
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:32,123
The music too loud?

236
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:37,552
There's just this empty spot
in the bed where my husband sleeps.

237
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:43,507
He said to tell you he's having
a little trouble with that tonight.

238
00:24:46,845 --> 00:24:48,916
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

239
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:51,447
Is that what's got you up?

240
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,065
Yeah, that...

241
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:56,760
...and things.

242
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,187
Things.

243
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:06,485
We got a new inmate today.

244
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:09,017
Simple-minded fella.

245
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:12,403
Do I wanna know what he did?

246
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:14,445
No.

247
00:25:15,836 --> 00:25:17,936
Things that happen in this world.

248
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:21,552
It's a wonder God allows it.

249
00:25:25,753 --> 00:25:27,575
Why don't you come to bed?

250
00:25:28,381 --> 00:25:31,344
I think I have something
that'll help you sleep.

251
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,709
You can have all you want.

252
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:38,191
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

253
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:40,301
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

254
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:42,574
Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?

255
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:43,821
No.

256
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:48,050
He'll want me to take sulfa tablets...

257
00:25:48,252 --> 00:25:50,620
...and I'll spend the week
puking in my office.

258
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:54,706
It will run its course by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

259
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:58,906
Poor old guy.

260
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:29,749
The legislature loosened up the purse
strings enough to hire on a new guard.

261
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:39,311
Look again.

262
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:40,922
He's right...

263
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,293
...there.

264
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:53,879
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people.

265
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,851
-Maybe it's rabid.
-Oh, my Christ.

266
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:59,728
-It could be.
-Oh, the big mouse expert.

267
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:02,002
The Mouse Man.

268
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:05,013
You see him foaming at the mouth,
Mouse Man?

269
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:07,315
I don't see its mouth at all.

270
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:20,213
-Brutal, we'll be hip-deep in mice.
-I just wanna see what he'll do.

271
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:22,669
In the interest of science, like.

272
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,408
He's in the damn restraint room.

273
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,911
He's chewing the padding
out of the walls...

274
00:28:06,104 --> 00:28:07,993
...making himself a nice little nest.

275
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:14,552
All right.

276
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:17,267
Let's go get the damn mouse.

277
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:29,495
Boss.

278
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,959
Saw me a mouse go by.

279
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,261
Can't put anything over on you.

280
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:07,991
You let him get past you.

281
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:10,522
No, I did not.
I been here all the time.

282
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,469
Then where the hell is he?

283
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:14,089
Well, I don't know.

284
00:29:16,478 --> 00:29:18,261
Three grown men...

285
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,455
...outsmarted by a mouse.

286
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:28,504
Bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

287
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,778
Yeah, that's the last
we'll see of him.

288
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:25,625
You little son of a bitch.

289
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,980
Well, I'll be damned.

290
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:33,843
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

291
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:36,634
That's a goddamn mouse.

292
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:40,624
Brute said he was
in here last night...

293
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:42,350
...begging for food.

294
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:44,911
He come right on up to the desk.

295
00:30:46,071 --> 00:30:47,183
Give him some room.

296
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:49,428
See what he does.

297
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,341
He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

298
00:31:31,674 --> 00:31:33,083
Goddamn!

299
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,701
You little scurvy!

300
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:39,566
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?!

301
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:41,782
I'm gonna kill you!

302
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:45,397
I'm gonna take you out!

303
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:49,904
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

304
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:52,043
It's just a little mouse, dumb merde.

305
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,942
You ugly little piece of sh--

306
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:56,685
-Are you listening to me?
-Fuck!

307
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:00,464
I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

308
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:02,036
...you little piece of shit!

309
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,372
Percy met your mouse.

310
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,961
It's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

311
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:35,574
Percy, we already tried that.

312
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:40,312
What'd you say?

313
00:32:40,504 --> 00:32:41,932
I said that we--

314
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:48,627
IKnock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

315
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:05,112
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

316
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:08,306
Don't that beat the mousy band?

317
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:16,151
You wanna think about
what you were doing?

318
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:19,824
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

319
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:23,373
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

320
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:25,137
...not to mention the inmates.

321
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:26,642
So what?

322
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:30,220
They aren't in cradle school,
case you didn't notice.

323
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:32,751
Although you treat them that way.

324
00:33:32,954 --> 00:33:35,984
We don't scare them
any more than we have to.

325
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:37,710
They're under enough strain.

326
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:39,954
Men under strain can snap.

327
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,503
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

328
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:45,843
...talking...

329
00:33:46,553 --> 00:33:47,981
...not yelling.

330
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,961
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward.

331
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:55,509
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

332
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:57,332
That's all.

333
00:33:58,234 --> 00:34:00,276
Anybody doesn't like it?

334
00:34:00,468 --> 00:34:02,606
You can kiss my ass.

335
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:05,551
You try it. Go on.

336
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:09,301
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

337
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:11,027
Okay, Brutal.

338
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,172
We all know who your connections are.

339
00:34:25,653 --> 00:34:29,613
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

340
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:31,320
Job be damned.

341
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:35,194
You done?

342
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,157
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

343
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,561
Arlen...

344
00:35:04,954 --> 00:35:07,217
...your daughter and her family
are here.

345
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:17,258
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

346
00:35:20,212 --> 00:35:22,552
Sitting down, sitting down!

347
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:24,364
Rehearsing now! Everybody settle!

348
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:26,426
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

349
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:30,071
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

350
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:33,427
-Is his head properly shaved?
-It's all dandruffy, and it smells.

351
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,029
I will take that as a yes.

352
00:35:35,221 --> 00:35:36,534
Let's go, Arlen.

353
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:40,246
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

354
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:44,054
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

355
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:46,068
...walking the Mile.

356
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,194
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

357
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:52,014
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

358
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:56,492
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people I've tramped on.

359
00:35:56,694 --> 00:35:59,062
And I hope they forgive me...

360
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:01,911
...and I'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

361
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:05,804
We're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

362
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:07,895
...hollering and shaking his dick.

363
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:10,542
-Actually--
-Still praying, still praying.

364
00:36:10,744 --> 00:36:12,786
-Getting right with Jesus.
-Do it quietly!

365
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:14,388
You old gink!

366
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,730
As I was saying...

367
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:18,483
...l don't believe they actually
shake their dicks.

368
00:36:18,714 --> 00:36:22,032
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

369
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:25,618
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked up.

370
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,562
On your feet, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

371
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:31,411
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

372
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:34,806
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

373
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:36,791
Walking the Mile.

374
00:36:36,983 --> 00:36:38,642
Walking in the Mile.

375
00:36:39,189 --> 00:36:41,461
Sitting down now.

376
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:45,336
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

377
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,698
What do I do?

378
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:49,326
Watch and learn.

379
00:36:55,828 --> 00:36:57,324
Getting strapped.

380
00:36:58,236 --> 00:37:00,019
Getting clamped.

381
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:03,212
Getting wired.

382
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:06,262
All right.

383
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:09,427
Getting all electrode.

384
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:15,881
Roll on one.

385
00:37:16,793 --> 00:37:19,660
"Roll on one" means I turn
the generator up full.

386
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,971
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

387
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:23,823
Arlen Bitterbuck...

388
00:37:24,187 --> 00:37:26,546
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury...

389
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:29,807
...sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

390
00:37:30,325 --> 00:37:32,693
Anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

391
00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:39,186
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and I want to shit in your hat.

392
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,709
I got to have Mae West
sit on my face...

393
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,528
...because I'm one horny motherfucker.

394
00:37:48,988 --> 00:37:49,966
You bastard.

395
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:52,469
That's a good one.

396
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:54,003
Quiet.

397
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:55,471
Quiet! Shut up!

398
00:37:55,672 --> 00:37:58,060
-Shut up!
-Sorry, boss.

399
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:02,261
One more remark like that, I'll
have Van Hay roll on two for real.

400
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,841
And I'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

401
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:06,921
It was pretty funny.

402
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:09,578
I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

403
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:13,961
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

404
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,407
Ever try not to laugh in church...

405
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:18,833
...when something funny gets stuck
in your head?

406
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:21,643
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

407
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:23,408
Let's keep going.

408
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,677
Soak the sponge.

409
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:35,722
Putting on the black hood.

410
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:40,047
And putting on my cap.

411
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:42,185
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

412
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:45,235
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

413
00:38:46,262 --> 00:38:49,263
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

414
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,847
Hush up there, Toot.

415
00:38:56,571 --> 00:38:58,546
Getting screwed.

416
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:01,337
I'm getting the cap.

417
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,736
Arlen Bitterbuck...

418
00:39:06,938 --> 00:39:10,160
...electricity shall be passed through
your body until you are dead...

419
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,529
...in accordance with state law.

420
00:39:12,952 --> 00:39:15,224
God have mercy on your soul.

421
00:39:16,471 --> 00:39:17,842
Amen.

422
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:21,228
Roll on two.

423
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,569
And that's that.

424
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:32,630
I'm frying! I'm frying!

425
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:37,262
I'm a done tom turkey!

426
00:39:38,874 --> 00:39:41,655
This is a shocking experience!

427
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,261
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

428
00:39:51,994 --> 00:39:54,612
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

429
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:57,105
Get that idiot out of the chair.

430
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:59,184
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

431
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:03,529
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

432
00:41:04,123 --> 00:41:05,810
...and live there forever?

433
00:41:08,122 --> 00:41:10,059
Could that be what heaven's like?

434
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:13,905
I just about believe that very thing.

435
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:22,863
Had me a young wife when I was 1 8.

436
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:27,984
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

437
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:31,628
And she'd lie there after...

438
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:34,802
...bare-breasted in the firelight.

439
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:39,089
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

440
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:44,402
That was my best time.

441
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:05,204
It'll be fine.

442
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:07,986
You'll do fine.

443
00:42:42,616 --> 00:42:46,193
Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

444
00:42:46,395 --> 00:42:50,288
...until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

445
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,791
God have mercy on your soul.

446
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:12,845
Roll on two.

447
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:56,625
Again.

448
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,843
Adios, chief.

449
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:09,610
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

450
00:44:12,114 --> 00:44:14,156
He's paid what he owed.

451
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,755
He's square with the house again...

452
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:19,536
...so keep your goddamn hands off him!

453
00:44:38,871 --> 00:44:40,626
What's up his ass?

454
00:44:40,818 --> 00:44:42,064
You.

455
00:44:43,033 --> 00:44:45,516
Always. You, Percy.

456
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:49,132
You gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

457
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:54,195
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

458
00:44:54,714 --> 00:44:57,428
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

459
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:01,072
Sounds to me like a pretty good job.

460
00:45:02,386 --> 00:45:05,704
I might just take it too,
soon as you put me out front.

461
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:08,179
Yeah, you heard me.

462
00:45:08,726 --> 00:45:11,248
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

463
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:18,776
Seeing a man die, that's not enough.
You gotta smell his nuts cook.

464
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:21,298
I just wanna be out front, is all.

465
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:24,434
Come on. One time.

466
00:45:25,624 --> 00:45:27,024
And then you know what?

467
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:30,035
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

468
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,982
And if I say no?

469
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:36,461
Well, I might just
stick around for good.

470
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,089
Make me a career of this...

471
00:45:40,345 --> 00:45:41,620
...boss.

472
00:46:32,277 --> 00:46:33,552
You won't believe this.

473
00:46:43,575 --> 00:46:44,850
Look.

474
00:46:46,394 --> 00:46:48,782
I done tame me that mouse.

475
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:51,093
We see that.

476
00:46:52,628 --> 00:46:55,284
Watch this. Watch what he do.

477
00:47:02,707 --> 00:47:04,567
Ain't he something now?

478
00:47:05,498 --> 00:47:07,636
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

479
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:09,900
-Mr. Jingles?
-That his name.

480
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:12,364
He whispered in my ear.

481
00:47:12,883 --> 00:47:13,899
Hey, captain...

482
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:17,611
...could I have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

483
00:47:17,812 --> 00:47:20,363
Your English gets better
when you want something.

484
00:47:20,565 --> 00:47:22,425
Wanna see what else he can do?

485
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:25,273
Watch, watch.

486
00:47:25,465 --> 00:47:28,361
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle,
wanna play fetch?

487
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:30,097
Wanna play fetch?

488
00:47:30,874 --> 00:47:33,070
Play fetch. Watch, watch, watch.

489
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:54,293
He fetch it every time. Every time.

490
00:47:55,032 --> 00:47:59,539
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or something.

491
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,690
Correct. That just what he is too.
He's a circus mouse.

492
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,828
When I get out,
he'll make me rich.

493
00:48:07,222 --> 00:48:09,456
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

494
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:11,854
We play fetch again?

495
00:48:12,468 --> 00:48:14,223
Well, well, well.

496
00:48:14,674 --> 00:48:16,783
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend.

497
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:18,739
Don't hurt him.

498
00:48:21,272 --> 00:48:22,547
Is that the one I chased?

499
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:24,523
Yeah, that's the one.

500
00:48:25,012 --> 00:48:28,148
Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.

501
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:30,123
Is that so?

502
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:32,971
Del's been asking for a box.

503
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:35,408
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it.

504
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,393
Might keep it for a pet.

505
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,912
What do you think?

506
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:45,775
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box...

507
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:50,666
...and get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

508
00:48:53,745 --> 00:48:55,826
That should do real nice.

509
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:07,190
Man said get a cigar box.

510
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:23,877
Hal, you wanted to see me?

511
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,886
Close the door.

512
00:49:34,868 --> 00:49:36,527
So you know...

513
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:40,364
...you got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

514
00:49:41,428 --> 00:49:43,020
"William Wharton."

515
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,322
He's what you call...

516
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:47,508
...a problem child.

517
00:49:48,343 --> 00:49:51,891
Got "Billy the IKid" tattooed
on his left arm.

518
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:55,976
Been rambling all over the state
last few years...

519
00:49:56,408 --> 00:49:58,508
...causing all kinds of trouble.

520
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:01,107
Finally hit the big time.

521
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:05,614
IKilled three people in a holdup.

522
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:07,849
One of them a pregnant woman.

523
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,175
Bad news all around.

524
00:50:26,004 --> 00:50:27,212
It's a tumor, Paul.

525
00:50:28,824 --> 00:50:30,483
A brain tumor.

526
00:50:32,152 --> 00:50:33,264
They got...

527
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,074
...x-ray pictures of it.

528
00:50:37,426 --> 00:50:39,852
It's the size of a lemon, they said.

529
00:50:42,452 --> 00:50:43,660
And...

530
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,249
...way down...

531
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:50,124
...deep inside,
where they can't operate.

532
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,681
I haven't told her.

533
00:50:55,379 --> 00:50:57,268
I can't think how.

534
00:51:00,884 --> 00:51:02,926
For the life of me, Paul...

535
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:07,242
...l can't think how to
tell my wife...

536
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,469
...she's going to die.

537
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:35,656
Oh, oh, God.

538
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:37,805
Oh, God.

539
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:42,868
I'm going.

540
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,951
What?

541
00:52:44,144 --> 00:52:46,896
To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

542
00:52:47,222 --> 00:52:48,622
Today.

543
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:51,730
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

544
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,226
That bad?

545
00:52:53,907 --> 00:52:55,278
Oh, yeah.

546
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:18,573
The boy's doped to the gills.

547
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,601
Hand me them clothes.

548
00:53:25,526 --> 00:53:27,348
William Wharton?

549
00:53:29,046 --> 00:53:30,829
You put on these clothes now.

550
00:53:38,608 --> 00:53:39,691
We'll have to do this.

551
00:53:41,811 --> 00:53:43,374
Hellraiser, huh?

552
00:53:43,575 --> 00:53:46,126
Look more like a limp noodle to me.

553
00:53:49,752 --> 00:53:53,396
You've been declared competent, son.
You know what that means?

554
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:55,726
You're gonna ride the lightning.

555
00:53:58,709 --> 00:54:00,272
Shut up, give us a hand.

556
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:02,737
Hellraiser.

557
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:33,866
You don't look so good.

558
00:54:35,766 --> 00:54:37,655
Look like you're running you a fever.

559
00:54:43,189 --> 00:54:44,713
Boss Edgecomb?

560
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:48,022
I needs to see you down here.

561
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,683
I got things to tend to, John Coffey.

562
00:54:55,254 --> 00:54:58,485
You just stay still in your cell.

563
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:10,762
E Block.

564
00:55:45,527 --> 00:55:46,955
Come on, let's go.

565
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:50,158
Come on. Look alive, big boy.

566
00:56:04,247 --> 00:56:05,417
Careful.

567
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:09,646
Careful.

568
00:56:09,848 --> 00:56:10,644
Step up.

569
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:11,823
Step up.

570
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,141
Ain't this a party now?

571
00:56:52,563 --> 00:56:53,608
-Is it or what?
-Let him go.

572
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,373
-Shoot him.
-See who you hit.

573
00:56:55,575 --> 00:56:56,975
Shoot the son of a bitch.

574
00:56:57,272 --> 00:56:58,068
Shoot him!

575
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,811
Hit him, Percy!
Goddamn it! Hit him.

576
00:57:01,012 --> 00:57:02,421
Hit me, you limp noodle.

577
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:03,477
Hit him, Percy!

578
00:57:03,669 --> 00:57:04,810
Goddamn it, hit him!

579
00:57:05,012 --> 00:57:06,258
Come on, Percy. Hit me.

580
00:57:07,026 --> 00:57:07,860
I'm warning you.

581
00:57:08,052 --> 00:57:09,394
You warning me?

582
00:57:09,903 --> 00:57:10,766
I'm warning you!

583
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:12,904
-You're warning me?!
-Shoot him!

584
00:57:13,106 --> 00:57:14,419
Well, come on--

585
00:57:20,721 --> 00:57:21,708
You're a big fucker.

586
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:24,269
Where'd you come from?

587
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,842
Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

588
00:57:37,044 --> 00:57:38,540
All right. Let it breathe.

589
00:57:39,096 --> 00:57:41,100
That's it. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

590
00:57:42,903 --> 00:57:44,552
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

591
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:47,631
-Didn't see it coming.
-Come on, boy, breathe.

592
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:49,769
Come on. Just breathe.

593
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:54,536
We thought he was doped.

594
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:58,890
Didn't we? Didn't we, all of us,
think he was doped?

595
00:57:59,092 --> 00:58:00,751
You didn't ask?

596
00:58:02,007 --> 00:58:03,790
I guess that's not a mistake...

597
00:58:04,146 --> 00:58:07,243
...you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

598
00:58:20,728 --> 00:58:24,199
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

599
00:58:24,631 --> 00:58:28,006
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

600
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:30,663
Say the situation's under control.
It's not a story.

601
00:58:30,865 --> 00:58:33,416
He won't appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

602
00:58:33,617 --> 00:58:35,755
What about you?
You're about to collapse.

603
00:58:35,986 --> 00:58:39,179
I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

604
00:58:39,928 --> 00:58:41,807
Go on now. Go.

605
00:58:49,173 --> 00:58:52,174
Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

606
00:59:16,726 --> 00:59:20,015
Boss, I needs to see you down here.

607
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:26,507
This is not a good time, John Coffey...

608
00:59:26,709 --> 00:59:28,598
...not a good time at all.

609
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:32,751
But I needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

610
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:55,154
Closer.

611
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:57,638
You know you ain't
supposed to do that.

612
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,110
Mind your business, Del.

613
01:00:10,355 --> 01:00:12,292
What do you want, John Coffey?

614
01:00:13,328 --> 01:00:14,373
Just to help it.

615
01:00:17,903 --> 01:00:19,284
Don't be afraid.

616
01:00:19,831 --> 01:00:20,809
Help!

617
01:00:21,586 --> 01:00:22,420
Help!

618
01:00:22,612 --> 01:00:24,271
Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

619
01:00:24,463 --> 01:00:25,891
Help!

620
01:00:26,103 --> 01:00:27,148
What are you doing?

621
01:00:31,703 --> 01:00:33,458
Boss Howell! Help!

622
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,789
Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

623
01:00:53,742 --> 01:00:55,880
Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!

624
01:00:56,082 --> 01:00:58,930
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

625
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:01,644
Del, for chrissakes, shut up!

626
01:01:46,326 --> 01:01:48,464
What did you just do to me?

627
01:01:50,354 --> 01:01:51,984
I helped it.

628
01:01:53,011 --> 01:01:54,574
Didn't I help it?

629
01:01:55,638 --> 01:01:57,776
I just took it back, is all.

630
01:01:58,544 --> 01:02:00,912
Awful tired now, boss.

631
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,051
Dog-tired.

632
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:29,098
Boss, what that man do to you?

633
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,656
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

634
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:36,049
Oh, not too bad.

635
01:03:37,239 --> 01:03:38,926
What did the doctor say?

636
01:03:41,075 --> 01:03:42,734
You know doctors.

637
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:44,978
Gobbledygook, mostly.

638
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:47,346
Gobbledygook.

639
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:03,496
Having stew tonight.

640
01:04:13,395 --> 01:04:15,015
What are you doing?

641
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,243
What does it feel like?

642
01:04:24,078 --> 01:04:26,418
Well, I know what it feels like.

643
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,731
It feels great.

644
01:05:06,995 --> 01:05:09,613
Not that I'm complaining...

645
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:14,284
...but we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 1 9.

646
01:05:14,514 --> 01:05:16,786
Yeah, we did, at your mom's.

647
01:05:18,226 --> 01:05:20,134
Wanna tell me what's going on?

648
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:24,776
Well...

649
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:28,266
...see, the thing is...

650
01:05:29,427 --> 01:05:32,841
...l never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

651
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:38,576
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

652
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:43,026
I'm thinking of taking the morning
off sick. You cover the fort for me?

653
01:05:44,052 --> 01:05:46,219
That's swell. Thanks.

654
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:48,933
Yeah, I'm sure I'll feel better.

655
01:05:56,846 --> 01:05:58,735
You're sure you ought to do this?

656
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,408
I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

657
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:21,416
Burt, you got some company.

658
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:23,593
Can I offer you a cold drink?

659
01:06:23,824 --> 01:06:26,797
Yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

660
01:06:27,123 --> 01:06:30,086
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home.

661
01:06:30,288 --> 01:06:31,880
Hope I'm not troubling you.

662
01:06:32,532 --> 01:06:34,536
Well, that depends, Mr...?

663
01:06:34,738 --> 01:06:38,602
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

664
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:41,067
The Green Mile.

665
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:44,261
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

666
01:06:45,009 --> 01:06:46,668
I'd like to ask you about one.

667
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,628
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

668
01:06:55,184 --> 01:06:56,114
Which client?

669
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:00,976
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

670
01:07:01,169 --> 01:07:02,444
John Coffey.

671
01:07:03,605 --> 01:07:04,679
Coffey.

672
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:06,280
Causing you problems?

673
01:07:06,741 --> 01:07:10,155
Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

674
01:07:10,356 --> 01:07:12,139
...but other than that....

675
01:07:12,303 --> 01:07:15,467
He cries, does he?
Got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

676
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:17,155
You know what he did.

677
01:07:17,808 --> 01:07:19,754
I read the court transcript.

678
01:07:20,627 --> 01:07:21,423
Thank you, missus.

679
01:07:21,615 --> 01:07:23,274
My pleasure.

680
01:07:24,109 --> 01:07:24,905
IKids!

681
01:07:25,106 --> 01:07:27,273
Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

682
01:07:27,504 --> 01:07:28,750
Coming, Mama!

683
01:07:28,942 --> 01:07:31,943
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

684
01:07:32,529 --> 01:07:34,763
I wonder if he did anything
like that before.

685
01:07:36,173 --> 01:07:38,062
Why? Has he said anything?

686
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:41,295
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

687
01:07:41,487 --> 01:07:45,227
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

688
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:49,168
...that it might be easy enough to
follow his back trail. Find out.

689
01:07:49,907 --> 01:07:53,551
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

690
01:07:53,743 --> 01:07:56,610
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

691
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,855
Believe me, we tried.

692
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:01,770
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

693
01:08:02,547 --> 01:08:03,918
How can that be?

694
01:08:04,149 --> 01:08:08,167
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

695
01:08:08,368 --> 01:08:12,232
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

696
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:15,464
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

697
01:08:16,213 --> 01:08:18,447
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

698
01:08:19,253 --> 01:08:20,777
He is...

699
01:08:21,104 --> 01:08:23,079
...strange, I admit.

700
01:08:23,444 --> 01:08:27,567
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

701
01:08:27,981 --> 01:08:30,321
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

702
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:33,264
I deal with them day in and day out.

703
01:08:34,032 --> 01:08:36,583
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

704
01:08:36,785 --> 01:08:39,604
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

705
01:08:40,947 --> 01:08:41,810
Do you?

706
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:45,799
One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.

707
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:47,976
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

708
01:08:48,178 --> 01:08:49,904
And yet you defended him.

709
01:08:50,863 --> 01:08:53,356
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

710
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:55,303
IKids! Lunch!

711
01:08:55,505 --> 01:08:56,751
Y'all listen to your mama!

712
01:09:01,202 --> 01:09:02,698
I'll tell you something.

713
01:09:03,734 --> 01:09:07,176
You listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

714
01:09:07,378 --> 01:09:08,682
I'm listening.

715
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,079
We had us a dog.

716
01:09:12,077 --> 01:09:14,023
Just a sweet mongrel.

717
01:09:14,225 --> 01:09:15,653
You know the kind.

718
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:20,267
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

719
01:09:21,102 --> 01:09:22,799
You get to know it.

720
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:27,181
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

721
01:09:27,374 --> 01:09:30,759
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

722
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:36,167
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

723
01:09:37,204 --> 01:09:39,304
My wife and I were not so lucky.

724
01:09:41,203 --> 01:09:42,660
Caleb, come here for a second.

725
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,163
Come here.

726
01:09:46,545 --> 01:09:47,753
Please, son.

727
01:09:49,297 --> 01:09:51,665
He still has the one good eye.

728
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,147
I suppose he's lucky...

729
01:09:55,349 --> 01:09:57,612
...not to be completely blind.

730
01:10:00,211 --> 01:10:03,816
We get down on our knees and thank God
for that much at least.

731
01:10:04,469 --> 01:10:05,802
Right, Caleb?

732
01:10:08,526 --> 01:10:09,417
Go on in, now.

733
01:10:12,717 --> 01:10:15,536
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

734
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:18,221
Just got it in his mind one day.

735
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,369
The same with John Coffey.

736
01:10:20,562 --> 01:10:24,618
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

737
01:10:25,261 --> 01:10:27,054
But those little girls...

738
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:29,587
...stayed raped and murdered.

739
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:32,137
Maybe he'd never done it before.

740
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:35,916
My dog never bit before.

741
01:10:37,585 --> 01:10:40,203
But I didn't concern myself with that.

742
01:10:41,172 --> 01:10:44,969
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

743
01:10:46,293 --> 01:10:47,405
Is Coffey guilty?

744
01:10:50,225 --> 01:10:51,884
Yes, he is.

745
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:54,061
Don't you doubt it.

746
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,784
And don't you turn your back on him.

747
01:10:57,581 --> 01:11:01,580
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

748
01:11:02,386 --> 01:11:03,978
...but in the end...

749
01:11:05,905 --> 01:11:07,314
...you'll get bit.

750
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,796
Oh, me! Oh, my!

751
01:11:28,366 --> 01:11:30,504
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

752
01:11:30,927 --> 01:11:32,749
It's from my missus.

753
01:11:36,307 --> 01:11:38,570
She wanted to thank you.

754
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:41,226
Thank me for what?

755
01:11:41,649 --> 01:11:42,857
Well, you know.

756
01:11:45,485 --> 01:11:46,827
For helping me.

757
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:48,994
Helping you with what?

758
01:11:49,676 --> 01:11:50,759
You know.

759
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:58,930
Was your missus pleased?

760
01:12:00,686 --> 01:12:02,278
Several times.

761
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:20,518
John, I can smell that from over here.
I surely can.

762
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:25,486
Can I give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

763
01:12:26,062 --> 01:12:29,476
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

764
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:35,748
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

765
01:12:36,467 --> 01:12:39,977
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't l?

766
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:45,002
It's yours, John. As you please.

767
01:12:45,588 --> 01:12:48,139
I think I'll just keep the rest, then.

768
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,878
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

769
01:12:58,036 --> 01:13:00,711
John, that's so very fine of you.

770
01:13:01,652 --> 01:13:05,392
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.
My mama'd thank you too, but she dead.

771
01:13:05,996 --> 01:13:07,281
Welcome.

772
01:13:08,528 --> 01:13:12,488
What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

773
01:13:16,402 --> 01:13:17,811
Here come the boss man.

774
01:13:18,636 --> 01:13:21,004
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

775
01:13:31,948 --> 01:13:33,894
You get that one for free.

776
01:13:34,863 --> 01:13:36,426
But that's the last one.

777
01:13:37,165 --> 01:13:39,984
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

778
01:13:40,531 --> 01:13:43,724
I guess I'm gonna have to
pay you out for the rest.

779
01:13:57,487 --> 01:13:58,436
Good shot, weren't it?

780
01:14:00,623 --> 01:14:02,665
The look on your face!

781
01:14:06,828 --> 01:14:08,362
You believe this?

782
01:14:08,564 --> 01:14:10,731
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

783
01:14:11,412 --> 01:14:13,291
Did y'all like that?

784
01:14:13,484 --> 01:14:15,689
I'm cooking up some turds
to go with it.

785
01:14:15,891 --> 01:14:17,444
Nice soft ones.

786
01:14:18,509 --> 01:14:20,714
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

787
01:14:22,163 --> 01:14:25,807
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

788
01:14:27,821 --> 01:14:30,209
Be careful with that.
That's fragile.

789
01:14:31,629 --> 01:14:34,563
What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

790
01:14:34,765 --> 01:14:36,807
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

791
01:14:37,229 --> 01:14:40,460
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

792
01:14:53,485 --> 01:14:55,757
You can come in here on your legs...

793
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,222
...but you'll go out on your backs.

794
01:14:58,414 --> 01:15:01,550
Billy the IKid gonna
guarantee you that.

795
01:15:01,905 --> 01:15:02,835
Come on, fuck-stick.

796
01:15:03,181 --> 01:15:07,180
No sneaking up on me this time.
We'll go man-to-man.

797
01:15:10,508 --> 01:15:11,562
Piss on me?

798
01:15:37,073 --> 01:15:39,624
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

799
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:44,016
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

800
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:46,145
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

801
01:15:46,347 --> 01:15:49,770
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

802
01:15:49,972 --> 01:15:51,822
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

803
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:56,176
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

804
01:15:58,191 --> 01:15:59,783
Thank you, Wild Bill.

805
01:16:07,532 --> 01:16:08,874
Not in there.

806
01:16:09,067 --> 01:16:10,284
I'll be good.

807
01:16:10,477 --> 01:16:12,970
Honest injun, I will. I will.

808
01:16:17,842 --> 01:16:19,184
He's pitching a fit.

809
01:16:19,376 --> 01:16:22,090
He'll be fine, boys.
Trust me on this one.

810
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:31,690
Hey, fellers!

811
01:16:38,097 --> 01:16:41,098
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

812
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,783
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

813
01:16:51,341 --> 01:16:53,412
I learned my lesson.

814
01:16:53,643 --> 01:16:55,139
I'll be good.

815
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:08,680
Hey, Toot.

816
01:17:10,771 --> 01:17:12,679
Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.

817
01:17:49,804 --> 01:17:51,942
Little Black Sambo!

818
01:17:53,007 --> 01:17:56,651
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

819
01:17:57,965 --> 01:18:00,103
Hope your bags are packed.

820
01:18:00,459 --> 01:18:02,377
My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

821
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:04,457
Where are we going? Let's go!

822
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,563
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original.

823
01:18:19,755 --> 01:18:21,251
Gotta give him that.

824
01:18:38,609 --> 01:18:42,119
Del, grab up your things. It's
a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

825
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:43,625
What you talking about?

826
01:18:43,827 --> 01:18:47,365
Important folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

827
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:48,880
Not just prison guards.

828
01:18:49,073 --> 01:18:52,170
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol.

829
01:18:54,194 --> 01:18:55,594
You fellas coming?

830
01:18:55,795 --> 01:18:59,142
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

831
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:02,537
But you knock them for a loop.

832
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:04,455
You knock them for a loop.

833
01:19:04,849 --> 01:19:06,987
Just like Mr. Harry says.

834
01:19:18,227 --> 01:19:20,461
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

835
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:23,492
All right, rehearsing now!

836
01:19:23,694 --> 01:19:26,082
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

837
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:29,582
I been fixing the plumbing here
for 1 0 years.

838
01:19:29,774 --> 01:19:31,941
Ain't never had to wear no tie before.

839
01:19:32,143 --> 01:19:35,940
Well, you're the VIP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

840
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:39,623
All right, everybody have a seat.

841
01:19:54,863 --> 01:19:56,426
This is great.

842
01:20:04,846 --> 01:20:09,257
Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

843
01:20:09,459 --> 01:20:10,916
...until you are dead...

844
01:20:11,118 --> 01:20:13,390
...in accordance with state law.

845
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:16,134
God have mercy on your soul.

846
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:25,570
Roll on two.

847
01:20:29,618 --> 01:20:30,509
That's that.

848
01:20:33,905 --> 01:20:36,772
Very good. Very professional.

849
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,743
Let's do it again.

850
01:20:41,261 --> 01:20:44,195
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

851
01:20:44,397 --> 01:20:45,193
Thank you.

852
01:20:45,394 --> 01:20:48,683
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

853
01:20:48,914 --> 01:20:51,848
You got that chin strap tight,
because his head will buck--

854
01:20:52,338 --> 01:20:54,025
All right, break it up.

855
01:20:57,967 --> 01:20:59,108
So?

856
01:20:59,339 --> 01:21:02,024
They love Mr. Jingles.
They laugh over there.

857
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:06,377
They cheer. They clap their hands.

858
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,430
Well, that's just aces.

859
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,790
Isn't that something?

860
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,062
You done good, old-timer.

861
01:21:13,264 --> 01:21:14,990
We're happy for you.

862
01:21:16,429 --> 01:21:18,184
Yeah, we are.

863
01:21:34,094 --> 01:21:35,369
Percy, you shit.

864
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:38,889
Come on.

865
01:21:39,091 --> 01:21:40,136
Del, get up.

866
01:21:40,337 --> 01:21:43,779
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

867
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:46,696
I was just playing. Come on, now.

868
01:21:46,897 --> 01:21:48,297
I was just having--

869
01:21:50,858 --> 01:21:52,392
Ain't you sweet?

870
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:55,365
Soft like a girl.

871
01:21:55,596 --> 01:21:57,418
I'd rather fuck your asshole...

872
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:59,556
...than your sister's pussy, I think.

873
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:01,062
Wharton!

874
01:22:06,193 --> 01:22:09,990
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

875
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:12,522
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty head.

876
01:22:13,232 --> 01:22:15,917
Your noodle ain't
limp at all, lover-boy.

877
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:18,699
I think you sweet on
old Billy the IKid.

878
01:22:21,068 --> 01:22:23,043
But smell you.

879
01:22:29,488 --> 01:22:30,859
Look.

880
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:32,461
He done piss his pants.

881
01:22:34,571 --> 01:22:36,297
Oh, my God.

882
01:22:37,707 --> 01:22:39,433
Look what the big man done.

883
01:22:39,635 --> 01:22:41,869
He bust other people with a stick.

884
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:49,004
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

885
01:22:51,824 --> 01:22:53,128
Learn when to shut up.

886
01:22:54,289 --> 01:22:55,948
All right, now.

887
01:22:57,358 --> 01:22:58,921
Don't touch me.

888
01:23:14,477 --> 01:23:17,066
You talk about this to anyone...

889
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:19,559
...l'll get you all fired.

890
01:23:21,171 --> 01:23:22,763
I swear that to God.

891
01:23:24,336 --> 01:23:28,680
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

892
01:23:35,153 --> 01:23:38,893
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

893
01:23:39,344 --> 01:23:41,482
You just keep on laughing!

894
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:46,662
Wetmore a good name for you!

895
01:23:48,849 --> 01:23:50,671
Percy Wetmore do a dance

896
01:23:50,862 --> 01:23:53,643
Listen to him squishing in his pant

897
01:24:04,529 --> 01:24:07,492
Well, what about Dean?
He's got a little boy.

898
01:24:07,694 --> 01:24:10,177
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

899
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:15,404
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

900
01:24:15,788 --> 01:24:18,089
Maybe forget to feed him.

901
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:22,089
How he keep up with his training?
He just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

902
01:24:31,727 --> 01:24:33,894
All right. I'll take him, then.

903
01:24:34,633 --> 01:24:35,620
Me.

904
01:24:36,906 --> 01:24:39,294
Merci beaucoup.
Thank you kindly, but...

905
01:24:40,656 --> 01:24:42,861
...you live out in the woods.

906
01:24:43,341 --> 01:24:44,654
Mr. Jingle, he be...

907
01:24:45,297 --> 01:24:48,423
...he be scared to live
out in the big woods.

908
01:24:53,066 --> 01:24:54,725
How about Mouseville?

909
01:24:55,885 --> 01:24:56,815
Mouseville?

910
01:24:57,007 --> 01:24:59,337
Tourist attraction down in Florida.

911
01:25:00,268 --> 01:25:01,764
Tallahassee, I think.

912
01:25:02,129 --> 01:25:04,430
Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?

913
01:25:04,622 --> 01:25:05,734
Tallahassee.

914
01:25:05,936 --> 01:25:09,378
It's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

915
01:25:11,633 --> 01:25:15,334
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

916
01:25:16,265 --> 01:25:17,799
You think he's got the stuff?

917
01:25:18,001 --> 01:25:19,823
I mean, he is pretty smart.

918
01:25:21,137 --> 01:25:22,661
What is Mouseville?

919
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:24,809
Tourist attraction, I said.

920
01:25:25,098 --> 01:25:26,728
They got this big tent.

921
01:25:26,929 --> 01:25:29,921
-You have to pay?
-Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

922
01:25:30,286 --> 01:25:31,177
Dime apiece.

923
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,767
-Two cents for the kids.
-For the kids.

924
01:25:33,969 --> 01:25:36,040
Inside the tent they got this...

925
01:25:37,162 --> 01:25:38,063
...mouse city...

926
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:40,327
...made out of...

927
01:25:40,528 --> 01:25:44,997
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

928
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:49,581
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

929
01:25:50,733 --> 01:25:53,581
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

930
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:57,158
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

931
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,087
Yeah, that's it.

932
01:26:03,823 --> 01:26:05,482
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

933
01:26:10,345 --> 01:26:13,222
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

934
01:26:13,644 --> 01:26:17,384
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

935
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:21,574
There he goes.

936
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:31,683
Mr. Jingles!

937
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:42,884
I knew I'd get him sooner or later.

938
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:45,867
It was just a matter of time, really.

939
01:26:46,059 --> 01:26:49,060
You fucking cruel bastard!

940
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:58,757
Give him to me.

941
01:26:59,371 --> 01:27:01,922
Give him to me. Might still be time.

942
01:27:14,063 --> 01:27:15,559
What are you doing?

943
01:27:18,993 --> 01:27:20,585
What the hell--?

944
01:27:20,844 --> 01:27:22,503
Please, John.

945
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:24,804
Help him.

946
01:27:26,128 --> 01:27:28,103
Please, Johnny, help him.

947
01:27:31,854 --> 01:27:34,309
Oh, dear Jesus.

948
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,852
The tail.

949
01:27:36,524 --> 01:27:37,607
Look at the tail.

950
01:29:04,401 --> 01:29:05,446
What'd you do?

951
01:29:05,964 --> 01:29:08,610
I helped Del's mouse...

952
01:29:08,937 --> 01:29:10,279
...his circus mouse.

953
01:29:10,922 --> 01:29:13,060
Gonna live in a mouse city...

954
01:29:13,262 --> 01:29:14,690
...down in....

955
01:29:16,619 --> 01:29:17,798
Florida.

956
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:22,632
Boss Percy bad.

957
01:29:22,891 --> 01:29:26,717
He mean. He step on Del's mouse.

958
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,451
I took it back, though.

959
01:29:36,461 --> 01:29:37,736
Brute...

960
01:29:38,446 --> 01:29:40,354
...you come along with me.

961
01:29:40,652 --> 01:29:43,720
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

962
01:30:06,728 --> 01:30:09,068
Now, don't start in on me.

963
01:30:09,385 --> 01:30:11,360
It was just a mouse.

964
01:30:11,562 --> 01:30:13,834
Never belonged here
in the first place.

965
01:30:14,027 --> 01:30:15,714
The mouse is fine.

966
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:17,575
Just fine.

967
01:30:17,777 --> 01:30:20,260
You're no better at mouse-killing
than you are...

968
01:30:20,682 --> 01:30:22,571
...at anything else around here.

969
01:30:24,653 --> 01:30:26,925
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?

970
01:30:28,652 --> 01:30:31,135
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

971
01:30:31,337 --> 01:30:33,581
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

972
01:30:34,608 --> 01:30:36,804
After all those talks we had about...

973
01:30:37,293 --> 01:30:39,048
...keeping the prisoners calm?

974
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:42,510
-Aren't you relieved?
-What kind of game is this?

975
01:30:42,702 --> 01:30:44,111
It's no game.

976
01:30:44,428 --> 01:30:45,741
See for yourself.

977
01:30:48,744 --> 01:30:49,923
Go on.

978
01:31:02,736 --> 01:31:05,545
Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle.

979
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:12,653
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

980
01:31:13,324 --> 01:31:17,419
I always keep a spare mouse in
my wallet for occasions such as this.

981
01:31:17,611 --> 01:31:20,200
Yeah, you playing with me.
Both of you.

982
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:22,693
Just who the hell you think you are?

983
01:31:25,485 --> 01:31:27,172
We're the people you work with.

984
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:29,214
But not for long.

985
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:32,111
Percy, I want your word.

986
01:31:32,649 --> 01:31:33,483
My word?

987
01:31:34,126 --> 01:31:36,648
I put you out front for Del...

988
01:31:37,549 --> 01:31:40,646
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the next day.

989
01:31:42,987 --> 01:31:47,360
What if I just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

990
01:31:47,562 --> 01:31:49,700
-Bullying me.
-Go ahead.

991
01:31:50,573 --> 01:31:53,325
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

992
01:31:53,517 --> 01:31:54,725
Over a mouse?

993
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:56,068
No.

994
01:31:56,778 --> 01:32:01,036
But four men will swear you stood by
while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean.

995
01:32:01,228 --> 01:32:05,025
About that, people will care.
Even your uncle the governor.

996
01:32:05,227 --> 01:32:07,653
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

997
01:32:08,143 --> 01:32:12,295
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

998
01:32:12,525 --> 01:32:14,308
I put you out front...

999
01:32:14,607 --> 01:32:16,812
...you put in for that transfer.

1000
01:32:18,318 --> 01:32:19,622
That's the deal.

1001
01:32:23,756 --> 01:32:24,897
All right.

1002
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:36,645
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1003
01:33:36,393 --> 01:33:38,090
Hey, boys.

1004
01:33:39,309 --> 01:33:42,473
No, now, say hey, Mr Jingles.

1005
01:33:44,555 --> 01:33:47,048
Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1006
01:34:01,031 --> 01:34:02,277
Boss Edgecomb.

1007
01:34:02,891 --> 01:34:04,319
Yes, Del?

1008
01:34:04,522 --> 01:34:07,044
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1009
01:34:08,521 --> 01:34:11,139
Here. You take him.

1010
01:34:19,531 --> 01:34:22,494
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1011
01:34:23,914 --> 01:34:24,844
...you know.

1012
01:34:26,925 --> 01:34:28,584
I'll take him, boss.

1013
01:34:29,227 --> 01:34:31,615
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1014
01:34:36,266 --> 01:34:40,485
You take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1015
01:35:00,712 --> 01:35:02,572
You gonna take him to Mouseville?

1016
01:35:03,436 --> 01:35:05,603
We'll do it together, most likely.

1017
01:35:06,735 --> 01:35:08,969
Maybe take a little vacation time.

1018
01:35:10,254 --> 01:35:12,900
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1019
01:35:13,294 --> 01:35:15,969
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1020
01:35:16,076 --> 01:35:16,872
That's right, Del.

1021
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:21,513
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1022
01:35:24,976 --> 01:35:26,404
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1023
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,347
I sure wish I could've
met you guys somewheres else.

1024
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,840
Hope he's good and scared.

1025
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:17,674
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1026
01:36:26,536 --> 01:36:28,262
Del, it's all right.

1027
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:10,440
Roll on one.

1028
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:24,424
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1029
01:37:25,776 --> 01:37:29,065
You be so quiet and so still.

1030
01:37:32,585 --> 01:37:33,994
Eduard Delacroix...

1031
01:37:34,407 --> 01:37:37,610
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1032
01:37:37,841 --> 01:37:41,485
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1033
01:37:41,869 --> 01:37:44,650
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1034
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,786
I sorry for what l--

1035
01:38:01,673 --> 01:38:03,850
I sorry for what I do.

1036
01:38:04,233 --> 01:38:06,505
I give anything to take it back.

1037
01:38:07,504 --> 01:38:09,096
But I can't.

1038
01:38:10,256 --> 01:38:12,327
God have mercy on me.

1039
01:38:13,008 --> 01:38:15,012
Ainsi soit-il. Amen.

1040
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,900
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1041
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,268
There's no such place.

1042
01:38:32,141 --> 01:38:35,689
That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

1043
01:38:38,126 --> 01:38:40,514
Just thought you should know, faggot.

1044
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:41,153
Eduard Delacroix...

1045
01:39:42,026 --> 01:39:45,440
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1046
01:39:45,930 --> 01:39:48,068
...in accordance with state law.

1047
01:39:49,162 --> 01:39:51,617
God have mercy on your soul.

1048
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:30,304
Roll on two!

1049
01:40:46,407 --> 01:40:47,557
The sponge is dry.

1050
01:40:47,759 --> 01:40:48,555
What?

1051
01:40:54,894 --> 01:40:57,540
-The goddamn sponge is dry!
-Well, don't you stop him!

1052
01:40:57,742 --> 01:41:00,254
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1053
01:41:14,765 --> 01:41:16,222
Is this normal?

1054
01:41:16,424 --> 01:41:18,975
God, the smell.

1055
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:22,590
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1056
01:41:23,023 --> 01:41:24,576
They're about done, I reckon!

1057
01:41:29,228 --> 01:41:31,616
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1058
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:38,213
He's cooking now!

1059
01:41:38,444 --> 01:41:40,486
He's cooking now!

1060
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:42,922
We gonna have a hoedown!

1061
01:41:43,182 --> 01:41:46,030
'Cution gumbo. Give me some!

1062
01:41:46,759 --> 01:41:48,044
Give me some!

1063
01:41:48,264 --> 01:41:50,172
I'm smelling gumbo! I'm smelling--

1064
01:41:51,468 --> 01:41:53,443
I said give me some!

1065
01:41:56,905 --> 01:41:58,765
I smell it!

1066
01:42:00,809 --> 01:42:01,643
Smell it!

1067
01:42:09,133 --> 01:42:10,178
Should I kill the juice?

1068
01:42:10,447 --> 01:42:11,875
No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1069
01:42:34,509 --> 01:42:35,880
He's frying now!

1070
01:42:36,072 --> 01:42:37,635
He's frying now!

1071
01:42:40,455 --> 01:42:41,768
Why don't you shut it down?

1072
01:42:41,961 --> 01:42:45,221
He's still alive. You want me to
shut down while he's still alive?

1073
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:53,862
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1074
01:42:55,148 --> 01:42:57,766
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1075
01:42:58,284 --> 01:43:01,036
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1076
01:43:06,733 --> 01:43:07,529
IKill it!

1077
01:43:14,376 --> 01:43:15,267
You do it!

1078
01:43:15,470 --> 01:43:17,378
You're running this show, ain't you?

1079
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:46,590
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1080
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:50,014
Brutal!

1081
01:43:50,254 --> 01:43:51,203
Brutal, no!

1082
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,054
What do you mean, no?

1083
01:43:53,256 --> 01:43:54,915
You saw what he did!

1084
01:43:55,116 --> 01:43:57,983
Delacroix's dead!
Percy is not worth it!

1085
01:43:58,185 --> 01:44:00,553
So he just gets away with it!
ls that how it works?

1086
01:44:08,716 --> 01:44:11,784
What in the blue fuck was that?

1087
01:44:12,743 --> 01:44:14,152
Jesus Christ.

1088
01:44:14,345 --> 01:44:17,097
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1089
01:44:17,289 --> 01:44:18,976
And the smell.

1090
01:44:19,629 --> 01:44:23,369
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for 5 years.

1091
01:44:23,561 --> 01:44:25,153
That's what I'm betting.

1092
01:44:26,026 --> 01:44:29,257
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1093
01:44:29,709 --> 01:44:31,080
You can hear him up there!

1094
01:44:31,627 --> 01:44:34,110
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1095
01:44:44,334 --> 01:44:46,501
Okay, boys, okay.

1096
01:44:46,991 --> 01:44:49,887
Now, what in the hell happened?

1097
01:44:50,088 --> 01:44:51,584
An execution.

1098
01:44:51,882 --> 01:44:52,927
A successful one.

1099
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:57,280
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1100
01:44:58,058 --> 01:45:00,484
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1101
01:45:02,124 --> 01:45:02,920
Isn't he?

1102
01:45:09,739 --> 01:45:10,918
Something to say?

1103
01:45:14,764 --> 01:45:17,065
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1104
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:20,902
How many years you spend
pissing on the toilet seat...

1105
01:45:21,094 --> 01:45:23,175
...before someone told you
to put it up?

1106
01:45:23,367 --> 01:45:25,093
Percy fucked up, Hal.

1107
01:45:25,295 --> 01:45:26,819
Pure and simple.

1108
01:45:27,366 --> 01:45:29,092
That's your official position?

1109
01:45:29,294 --> 01:45:31,173
Don't you think it should be?

1110
01:45:31,528 --> 01:45:35,421
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1111
01:45:35,623 --> 01:45:37,991
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1112
01:45:38,347 --> 01:45:39,689
Isn't that right, Percy?

1113
01:45:42,701 --> 01:45:44,321
Barbecue

1114
01:45:44,523 --> 01:45:47,812
Me and you
Stinky, pinky

1115
01:45:48,839 --> 01:45:51,773
Weren't Billy, Jilly, Hilly or Pa

1116
01:45:51,975 --> 01:45:54,823
it was a French-fried Cajun
Named Delacroix

1117
01:45:56,741 --> 01:45:57,604
Barbecue

1118
01:45:58,343 --> 01:45:59,656
Me and you

1119
01:45:59,849 --> 01:46:01,345
Stinky, pinky

1120
01:46:03,244 --> 01:46:04,701
Weren't Billy, Jilly--

1121
01:46:05,862 --> 01:46:09,698
You're 1 0 seconds away from spending the
rest of your life in the padded room.

1122
01:46:27,306 --> 01:46:28,389
Poor old Del.

1123
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:33,732
Poor old Del.

1124
01:46:39,563 --> 01:46:40,838
You okay?

1125
01:46:42,056 --> 01:46:44,194
I could feel it from here.

1126
01:46:44,808 --> 01:46:46,179
What do you mean?

1127
01:46:47,081 --> 01:46:48,605
You could hear it.

1128
01:46:48,846 --> 01:46:50,984
Is that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1129
01:46:51,244 --> 01:46:53,066
He out of it now, though.

1130
01:46:53,862 --> 01:46:55,626
He the lucky one.

1131
01:46:56,173 --> 01:46:59,711
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

1132
01:47:06,214 --> 01:47:07,777
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1133
01:47:08,842 --> 01:47:11,210
He run away under that door.

1134
01:47:12,745 --> 01:47:14,816
Don't think he'll be back.

1135
01:47:16,198 --> 01:47:18,624
He felt it too, through me.

1136
01:47:20,264 --> 01:47:22,239
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1137
01:47:22,758 --> 01:47:25,635
All that hurt just spill out.

1138
01:47:32,108 --> 01:47:34,342
Awful tired now, boss.

1139
01:47:36,107 --> 01:47:37,727
Dog-tired.

1140
01:47:43,339 --> 01:47:44,902
Me too, John.

1141
01:47:47,530 --> 01:47:48,671
Me too.

1142
01:48:46,117 --> 01:48:47,718
I hate this.

1143
01:48:48,457 --> 01:48:49,732
I know.

1144
01:49:10,573 --> 01:49:12,165
I am so happy to see you.

1145
01:49:14,025 --> 01:49:15,780
Look at you.

1146
01:49:16,653 --> 01:49:18,590
We missed you at church.

1147
01:49:22,254 --> 01:49:24,555
My hair--

1148
01:49:24,776 --> 01:49:27,490
-You look fine.
-I'm just a mess.

1149
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:34,855
She's having one of her good days.

1150
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:37,224
I thank God for that.

1151
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:41,280
What's a bad day?

1152
01:49:44,551 --> 01:49:46,344
Sometimes she's...

1153
01:49:47,754 --> 01:49:49,058
...she's not herself anymore.

1154
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:51,082
She swears.

1155
01:49:51,303 --> 01:49:52,712
She swears?

1156
01:49:52,933 --> 01:49:54,467
It just pops out.

1157
01:49:55,082 --> 01:49:57,604
Most awful language you can imagine.

1158
01:49:57,805 --> 01:50:00,001
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1159
01:50:01,286 --> 01:50:04,067
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1160
01:50:04,269 --> 01:50:07,299
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice....

1161
01:50:11,337 --> 01:50:13,725
I'm glad she's having a good day.

1162
01:50:14,828 --> 01:50:17,129
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1163
01:50:32,589 --> 01:50:33,663
Honey...

1164
01:50:34,153 --> 01:50:36,704
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1165
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:40,319
...l'm afraid I'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1166
01:50:48,903 --> 01:50:50,849
I'm thinking I love you.

1167
01:50:52,710 --> 01:50:56,028
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1168
01:51:02,089 --> 01:51:05,388
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1169
01:51:09,292 --> 01:51:11,622
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1170
01:51:11,977 --> 01:51:13,252
Well, thank you.

1171
01:51:13,512 --> 01:51:16,168
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1172
01:51:16,389 --> 01:51:17,770
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1173
01:51:18,182 --> 01:51:20,359
Brutal, you gonna hog all them taters?

1174
01:51:20,551 --> 01:51:23,006
Yes, I am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1175
01:51:23,207 --> 01:51:24,223
Come on, now.

1176
01:51:25,509 --> 01:51:28,165
Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1177
01:51:28,357 --> 01:51:30,629
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1178
01:51:33,354 --> 01:51:35,617
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1179
01:51:35,848 --> 01:51:37,535
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1180
01:51:37,996 --> 01:51:39,751
He did the same thing to me.

1181
01:51:40,106 --> 01:51:42,081
He put his hands on me.

1182
01:51:42,829 --> 01:51:44,862
He took my bladder infection away.

1183
01:51:49,543 --> 01:51:50,492
It's true.

1184
01:51:50,693 --> 01:51:52,937
When he came home that day, he was...

1185
01:51:54,405 --> 01:51:55,747
...all better.

1186
01:51:57,196 --> 01:52:00,005
Now, wait.
You're talking about...

1187
01:52:00,198 --> 01:52:01,790
...an authentic healing?

1188
01:52:03,113 --> 01:52:04,388
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1189
01:52:05,098 --> 01:52:06,277
I am.

1190
01:52:08,589 --> 01:52:11,619
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1191
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:14,439
What's it got to do with us?

1192
01:52:14,794 --> 01:52:16,203
You're thinking about Melinda.

1193
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:17,767
Melinda?

1194
01:52:18,343 --> 01:52:19,139
Melinda Moores?

1195
01:52:19,465 --> 01:52:23,042
So, Paul, you really think
you can help her?

1196
01:52:23,627 --> 01:52:27,683
It's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1197
01:52:28,652 --> 01:52:31,394
-...but there might be a chance.
-Hold on now.

1198
01:52:31,596 --> 01:52:36,161
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1199
01:52:36,363 --> 01:52:38,501
No, Hal would never stand for that.

1200
01:52:38,732 --> 01:52:41,215
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything, even if it fell on him.

1201
01:52:41,446 --> 01:52:42,980
So you're talking about...

1202
01:52:43,594 --> 01:52:45,502
...taking John Coffey to her.

1203
01:52:50,317 --> 01:52:52,800
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1204
01:52:53,769 --> 01:52:55,178
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1205
01:52:55,371 --> 01:52:58,267
-Dang right it is.
-No, not for you, Dean.

1206
01:52:58,469 --> 01:53:01,442
The way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1207
01:53:01,672 --> 01:53:03,264
That way, you can deny everything.

1208
01:53:04,012 --> 01:53:05,440
Why do I have to stay behind?

1209
01:53:07,464 --> 01:53:09,314
Our boy's grown up...

1210
01:53:09,517 --> 01:53:10,754
...gone off to school.

1211
01:53:10,955 --> 01:53:13,371
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1212
01:53:13,765 --> 01:53:14,982
Brutal's a single man.

1213
01:53:15,204 --> 01:53:18,435
You're the only one here with
two children, another on the way.

1214
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:21,725
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1215
01:53:23,912 --> 01:53:26,463
Brutal, help me out here.

1216
01:53:27,748 --> 01:53:29,512
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1217
01:53:29,705 --> 01:53:31,162
The finest.

1218
01:53:31,373 --> 01:53:33,444
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1219
01:53:33,675 --> 01:53:36,043
...to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1220
01:53:36,236 --> 01:53:37,923
I have no doubt.

1221
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:41,155
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1222
01:53:41,357 --> 01:53:44,349
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1223
01:53:45,414 --> 01:53:47,523
Now, what if he escapes?

1224
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:50,784
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1225
01:53:50,986 --> 01:53:54,150
...but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1226
01:53:54,342 --> 01:53:56,068
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1227
01:53:57,670 --> 01:53:58,983
In fact...

1228
01:54:01,516 --> 01:54:03,271
...l don't think he did it at all.

1229
01:54:06,244 --> 01:54:09,859
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1230
01:54:10,061 --> 01:54:12,065
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1231
01:54:12,324 --> 01:54:16,553
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1232
01:54:18,251 --> 01:54:19,296
And plus...

1233
01:54:19,757 --> 01:54:21,512
...he's huge.

1234
01:54:21,895 --> 01:54:26,594
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1235
01:54:26,796 --> 01:54:30,622
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1236
01:54:30,987 --> 01:54:32,195
I'd insist on that.

1237
01:54:33,452 --> 01:54:36,098
If he tried anything,
anything at all...

1238
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:38,534
...we'd have to take him down.

1239
01:54:39,148 --> 01:54:40,087
You understand?

1240
01:54:51,462 --> 01:54:52,737
So...

1241
01:54:53,448 --> 01:54:55,203
...tell us what you had in mind.

1242
01:55:02,156 --> 01:55:03,162
There it is.

1243
01:55:03,364 --> 01:55:04,773
I see it.

1244
01:55:15,016 --> 01:55:16,924
You think this is enough?

1245
01:55:18,057 --> 01:55:19,581
I don't know.

1246
01:55:54,788 --> 01:55:56,322
You fellas thirsty?

1247
01:55:56,715 --> 01:55:58,143
Fresh out of the icebox.

1248
01:55:58,346 --> 01:55:59,938
You bet. That's swell, Brutal.

1249
01:56:00,168 --> 01:56:01,855
-Thanks.
-Oh, yeah.

1250
01:56:02,057 --> 01:56:03,035
Hot in here.

1251
01:56:03,237 --> 01:56:04,186
Boy, howdy.

1252
01:56:04,388 --> 01:56:07,495
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't l?

1253
01:56:07,687 --> 01:56:10,986
-My ass, you get some too.
-What makes you think you deserve any?

1254
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:13,594
Because I got a big pecker.

1255
01:56:13,834 --> 01:56:16,480
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1256
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:19,453
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.
Come on, now.

1257
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:21,208
Don't be stingy hogs.

1258
01:56:24,297 --> 01:56:25,668
Come on.

1259
01:56:26,762 --> 01:56:28,699
Come on now, fellers.

1260
01:56:29,802 --> 01:56:30,981
Come on, boss.

1261
01:56:31,212 --> 01:56:32,967
I been good all day.

1262
01:56:36,074 --> 01:56:37,694
It's hot in here.

1263
01:56:37,925 --> 01:56:41,272
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1264
01:56:41,483 --> 01:56:43,305
Why don't you give me some?

1265
01:56:49,769 --> 01:56:51,015
Come on.

1266
01:56:55,907 --> 01:56:57,566
You gonna stay behaved?

1267
01:56:57,988 --> 01:56:59,301
Come on, you clunk, give me that.

1268
01:56:59,532 --> 01:57:01,124
You promise me...

1269
01:57:01,508 --> 01:57:03,617
...or I'll drink this myself
right here.

1270
01:57:04,069 --> 01:57:06,437
Come on, now. Don't be that way.

1271
01:57:06,955 --> 01:57:08,383
I'll be good.

1272
01:57:32,264 --> 01:57:33,213
Cup.

1273
01:58:21,923 --> 01:58:24,349
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

1274
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:26,757
After this, there's no turning back.

1275
01:58:28,234 --> 01:58:29,346
So?

1276
01:58:30,181 --> 01:58:31,331
We gonna do this?

1277
01:58:31,811 --> 01:58:34,688
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1278
01:58:34,889 --> 01:58:37,027
I'd like to take a ride.

1279
01:58:42,053 --> 01:58:43,999
Guess we're all in.

1280
01:58:54,636 --> 01:58:55,844
What is this?

1281
01:58:58,213 --> 01:58:59,143
Payback.

1282
01:58:59,335 --> 01:59:00,859
That's right.

1283
01:59:05,348 --> 01:59:08,100
-No, you let me go! Let go of me!
-Settle down.

1284
01:59:08,293 --> 01:59:09,223
-Let go!
-Settle down.

1285
01:59:09,415 --> 01:59:10,661
What are you doing?

1286
01:59:10,853 --> 01:59:11,744
Settle down.

1287
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:21,345
"Miss Lotta Leadpipe."

1288
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:25,536
-What would your mother say?
-You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1289
01:59:25,738 --> 01:59:28,356
I know people. Big people!

1290
01:59:28,739 --> 01:59:31,712
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1291
01:59:31,914 --> 01:59:33,803
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1292
01:59:33,995 --> 01:59:36,546
You're dead wrong about that, you know.

1293
01:59:41,993 --> 01:59:44,160
You gonna put your arms up?

1294
01:59:44,966 --> 01:59:47,996
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1295
01:59:50,059 --> 01:59:51,651
There you go.

1296
01:59:59,525 --> 02:00:00,906
Please, Paul.

1297
02:00:01,097 --> 02:00:04,741
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1298
02:00:05,931 --> 02:00:07,781
You would think that.

1299
02:00:09,355 --> 02:00:11,714
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1300
02:00:11,915 --> 02:00:14,245
You can't do this to me. You can't.

1301
02:00:14,438 --> 02:00:16,739
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1302
02:00:16,931 --> 02:00:19,932
We can and we are.

1303
02:00:26,406 --> 02:00:30,846
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1304
02:00:31,048 --> 02:00:34,558
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1305
02:00:43,113 --> 02:00:45,117
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1306
02:00:45,347 --> 02:00:47,418
What do you say if somebody stops by?

1307
02:00:49,126 --> 02:00:50,881
Coffey got upset after lights out...

1308
02:00:51,111 --> 02:00:54,208
...so we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1309
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:56,232
They hear kicking,
they'll think it's him.

1310
02:00:56,424 --> 02:00:57,373
What about me?

1311
02:00:57,575 --> 02:01:00,097
You're in Admin pulling Del's file,
going over the witnesses...

1312
02:01:00,299 --> 02:01:03,291
...on account of how big a screw-up
the execution was.

1313
02:01:05,506 --> 02:01:07,136
We going for the ride now?

1314
02:01:07,367 --> 02:01:09,889
That's right. We going for the ride.

1315
02:01:11,941 --> 02:01:13,283
What about us, Dean?

1316
02:01:13,514 --> 02:01:17,187
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1317
02:01:17,379 --> 02:01:19,901
Probably take a few hours
before you're back.

1318
02:01:23,114 --> 02:01:25,147
Where you think you going?

1319
02:01:31,467 --> 02:01:32,742
You a bad man.

1320
02:01:32,964 --> 02:01:35,236
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1321
02:01:42,698 --> 02:01:44,520
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1322
02:01:44,808 --> 02:01:46,179
What's wrong?

1323
02:02:09,129 --> 02:02:12,159
Whole room, whole room's spinning.

1324
02:02:12,361 --> 02:02:14,528
It's like I'm shitty-ass drunk.

1325
02:02:14,730 --> 02:02:17,031
Had me some shine or...

1326
02:02:17,703 --> 02:02:19,007
...or what?

1327
02:02:21,194 --> 02:02:23,812
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1328
02:02:24,004 --> 02:02:25,567
White man...

1329
02:02:25,768 --> 02:02:30,169
...ought not to sit in no nigger
electric chair. No, sir.

1330
02:02:37,027 --> 02:02:39,645
He a bad man.

1331
02:02:58,471 --> 02:02:59,554
Look, boss.

1332
02:03:03,909 --> 02:03:06,460
It's Cassie, the lady
in the rocking chair.

1333
02:03:07,170 --> 02:03:08,896
John, we have to be quiet now.

1334
02:03:09,414 --> 02:03:11,744
You see her? You see the lady?

1335
02:03:11,946 --> 02:03:13,921
Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

1336
02:03:24,874 --> 02:03:26,724
Let's go. Go, go!

1337
02:03:30,954 --> 02:03:32,066
Now!

1338
02:04:06,630 --> 02:04:08,576
All right, big boy.
Let's get moving. Come on.

1339
02:04:41,798 --> 02:04:43,169
Upsy-daisy.

1340
02:04:52,549 --> 02:04:54,620
Do you know where we're taking you?

1341
02:04:57,833 --> 02:04:58,974
Help a lady?

1342
02:05:00,873 --> 02:05:02,301
That's right.

1343
02:05:03,108 --> 02:05:04,220
How do you know?

1344
02:05:05,995 --> 02:05:07,270
Don't know.

1345
02:05:09,092 --> 02:05:13,503
Tell the truth, boss,
I don't know much of anything.

1346
02:05:14,722 --> 02:05:15,901
I never have.

1347
02:05:49,765 --> 02:05:51,673
We can still turn back.

1348
02:05:53,544 --> 02:05:54,589
Boss, look.

1349
02:05:54,982 --> 02:05:56,641
Someone's up.

1350
02:05:58,118 --> 02:05:59,873
This was a mistake.

1351
02:06:00,266 --> 02:06:01,982
Christ, what were we thinking?

1352
02:06:02,185 --> 02:06:05,311
It's too late now. John, you stay.

1353
02:06:09,607 --> 02:06:12,474
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

1354
02:06:22,276 --> 02:06:24,865
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

1355
02:06:25,058 --> 02:06:27,263
It's us. It's Paul and Brutal.

1356
02:06:27,465 --> 02:06:28,836
-It's us.
-Jesus.

1357
02:06:29,028 --> 02:06:31,099
It isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1358
02:06:31,301 --> 02:06:34,619
No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

1359
02:06:34,888 --> 02:06:35,866
Are you hostages?

1360
02:06:37,122 --> 02:06:38,435
Who's out there?

1361
02:06:38,820 --> 02:06:40,709
-Who's by that truck?
-Harry, the lights!

1362
02:06:44,967 --> 02:06:46,722
John Coffey.

1363
02:06:47,269 --> 02:06:48,218
Halt!

1364
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:50,625
-Stay where you are!
-Take it easy, now.

1365
02:06:50,952 --> 02:06:52,774
-Don't you move!
-Wait!

1366
02:06:52,966 --> 02:06:54,212
I'm warning you.

1367
02:06:54,404 --> 02:06:55,871
Halt or I'll shoot!

1368
02:06:56,102 --> 02:06:58,010
-I said halt!
-Hal, put the gun down!

1369
02:07:03,429 --> 02:07:05,855
Who are you talking to down there?

1370
02:07:06,114 --> 02:07:07,063
Goddamn it!

1371
02:07:07,265 --> 02:07:11,494
Now, nobody is hurt.
And we are here to help.

1372
02:07:11,686 --> 02:07:14,754
Help what? I don't understand.

1373
02:07:14,985 --> 02:07:17,699
You're just gonna have to trust me.

1374
02:07:33,610 --> 02:07:35,038
What do you want?

1375
02:07:37,542 --> 02:07:39,450
Make them go away!

1376
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:44,034
I don't want no salesmen...

1377
02:07:44,226 --> 02:07:45,923
...in the middle of the night.

1378
02:07:46,470 --> 02:07:50,047
Tell them to take a flying fuck
at a rolling....

1379
02:07:50,249 --> 02:07:51,591
Just to help.

1380
02:07:52,263 --> 02:07:54,977
Just to help, boss. That's all.

1381
02:07:55,562 --> 02:07:58,717
You can't. No one can.

1382
02:08:09,602 --> 02:08:11,942
-Stay out of here!
-Don't you go in there!

1383
02:08:12,163 --> 02:08:14,982
-Whoever you are, just stay out!
-Don't you do it!

1384
02:08:15,529 --> 02:08:18,080
I'm not dressed for visitors.

1385
02:08:19,682 --> 02:08:22,108
You stop now. You hear me?

1386
02:08:22,722 --> 02:08:25,340
-Paul, I don't want him up there.
-Boss...

1387
02:08:25,609 --> 02:08:27,680
...you just be quiet now.

1388
02:09:13,474 --> 02:09:15,775
It's all right, Hal. It's all right.

1389
02:09:16,006 --> 02:09:18,394
Hal, watch. Just watch him.

1390
02:09:24,359 --> 02:09:26,814
Don't come near me, pig-fucker.

1391
02:09:40,097 --> 02:09:42,302
Why do you have so many scars?

1392
02:09:45,065 --> 02:09:47,232
Who hurt you so badly?

1393
02:09:48,738 --> 02:09:50,982
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1394
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:55,135
What's your name?

1395
02:09:55,681 --> 02:09:58,778
John Coffey, ma'am.
Like the drink...

1396
02:09:59,048 --> 02:10:01,311
...only not spelt the same.

1397
02:10:07,689 --> 02:10:08,734
Ma'am?

1398
02:10:16,425 --> 02:10:18,275
Yes, John Coffey?

1399
02:10:19,945 --> 02:10:21,431
I see it.

1400
02:10:22,084 --> 02:10:23,196
I see it.

1401
02:10:30,082 --> 02:10:32,633
What's happening?

1402
02:10:33,861 --> 02:10:37,917
You be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1403
02:12:01,056 --> 02:12:03,396
Come on, John. Sick it up.

1404
02:12:03,713 --> 02:12:05,851
Come on. Cough it out
like you done before.

1405
02:12:07,367 --> 02:12:10,972
He's choking. Whatever he sucked out
of her, he's choking on it.

1406
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:16,573
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

1407
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:30,977
How did I get here?

1408
02:12:35,236 --> 02:12:38,170
We were going to the hospital
in Vicksburg.

1409
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:39,677
Remember?

1410
02:12:40,962 --> 02:12:42,170
Melly...

1411
02:12:42,659 --> 02:12:44,414
...it doesn't matter.

1412
02:12:45,124 --> 02:12:46,552
It doesn't matter anymore.

1413
02:12:46,755 --> 02:12:49,277
Did I have the x-ray?

1414
02:12:49,929 --> 02:12:51,357
Did l?

1415
02:12:53,957 --> 02:12:55,136
Yes.

1416
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,836
Yes. It was clear.
There was no tumor.

1417
02:13:16,744 --> 02:13:18,019
Can you stand up?

1418
02:13:18,211 --> 02:13:20,186
Can you turn around and see this lady?

1419
02:13:32,165 --> 02:13:33,689
What's your name?

1420
02:13:34,917 --> 02:13:36,988
John Coffey, ma'am.

1421
02:13:38,408 --> 02:13:40,000
Like the drink.

1422
02:13:41,381 --> 02:13:43,385
Only not spelt the same.

1423
02:13:43,712 --> 02:13:47,298
No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all.

1424
02:13:51,912 --> 02:13:53,283
No, you can't.

1425
02:14:16,962 --> 02:14:18,975
I dreamed of you.

1426
02:14:21,632 --> 02:14:24,422
I dreamed you were wandering
in the dark.

1427
02:14:25,861 --> 02:14:27,683
And so was l.

1428
02:14:29,448 --> 02:14:31,519
And we found each other.

1429
02:14:32,421 --> 02:14:34,904
We found each other in the dark.

1430
02:14:53,664 --> 02:14:55,294
Take it, John. It's a present.

1431
02:14:55,688 --> 02:14:57,692
It's St. Christopher.

1432
02:14:58,881 --> 02:15:00,990
I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey.

1433
02:15:01,797 --> 02:15:04,185
And wear it. He'll keep you safe.

1434
02:15:04,578 --> 02:15:06,006
Please.

1435
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:08,001
Wear it for me.

1436
02:15:21,984 --> 02:15:23,710
Thank you, ma'am.

1437
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:27,460
Thank you, John.

1438
02:15:33,857 --> 02:15:38,498
Christ, he goes down, it'll take three
mules and a crane to pick him up again.

1439
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:42,335
Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1440
02:15:57,382 --> 02:16:00,316
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1441
02:16:00,643 --> 02:16:02,714
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

1442
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:05,591
I give him a few days.

1443
02:16:05,860 --> 02:16:09,178
One of us will do a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1444
02:16:09,380 --> 02:16:11,969
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1445
02:16:12,161 --> 02:16:14,338
Let's just get him back on the Mile.

1446
02:16:27,621 --> 02:16:30,076
Am I happy to see you.
You were gone so long.

1447
02:16:30,277 --> 02:16:32,281
Wild Bill's making noise
like he's waking up.

1448
02:16:32,483 --> 02:16:33,461
What happened to him?

1449
02:16:33,864 --> 02:16:36,827
He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

1450
02:16:40,136 --> 02:16:41,593
Okay, John.

1451
02:16:43,397 --> 02:16:46,878
We're gonna set you down
on your bed now. Here we go.

1452
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:05,272
Well?

1453
02:17:07,047 --> 02:17:08,830
What about Mrs. Moores?

1454
02:17:10,816 --> 02:17:12,676
Was it like the mouse?

1455
02:17:13,923 --> 02:17:14,968
Was it...

1456
02:17:16,963 --> 02:17:19,782
...you know, a miracle?

1457
02:17:22,401 --> 02:17:24,472
Yes, it was.

1458
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,074
Damn!

1459
02:17:41,189 --> 02:17:42,330
Now...

1460
02:17:42,886 --> 02:17:45,465
...l want to talk, not shout.

1461
02:17:45,696 --> 02:17:48,899
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1462
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:54,010
My mama always said you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

1463
02:17:57,636 --> 02:17:59,295
Guess she was wrong.

1464
02:18:02,403 --> 02:18:03,899
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1465
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:05,375
-In a minute.
-Now!

1466
02:18:05,606 --> 02:18:07,265
Right now! I want out now!

1467
02:18:11,619 --> 02:18:13,527
Shut up and listen.

1468
02:18:14,247 --> 02:18:18,016
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

1469
02:18:18,725 --> 02:18:21,113
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born.

1470
02:18:21,535 --> 02:18:25,850
We'll tell people how you
sabotaged Del's execution...

1471
02:18:26,052 --> 02:18:30,079
...and pissed yourself like a frightened
little girl. Yes, we will talk.

1472
02:18:31,202 --> 02:18:32,630
But, Percy...

1473
02:18:33,284 --> 02:18:35,192
...you mind me now.

1474
02:18:35,624 --> 02:18:39,517
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1475
02:18:40,965 --> 02:18:42,173
We know people too.

1476
02:18:43,622 --> 02:18:45,789
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

1477
02:18:48,264 --> 02:18:51,198
Let bygones be bygones.

1478
02:18:52,167 --> 02:18:54,718
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.

1479
02:18:55,140 --> 02:18:59,129
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

1480
02:18:59,523 --> 02:19:02,870
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1481
02:19:03,877 --> 02:19:05,219
Always has.

1482
02:19:14,023 --> 02:19:16,411
May I be let out of this coat now?

1483
02:19:35,525 --> 02:19:36,637
My things?

1484
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:41,595
Think it over, Percy.

1485
02:19:42,334 --> 02:19:44,098
I intend to.

1486
02:19:44,962 --> 02:19:47,925
I intend to think it over very hard.

1487
02:19:49,604 --> 02:19:51,032
Starting right now.

1488
02:20:00,671 --> 02:20:03,874
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

1489
02:20:17,694 --> 02:20:19,803
-Hey, let him go!
-John, let go!

1490
02:20:20,005 --> 02:20:20,983
Let go, John!

1491
02:20:21,223 --> 02:20:23,006
John, goddamn it! Let him go!

1492
02:20:23,199 --> 02:20:24,033
Let go, John! No!

1493
02:20:25,894 --> 02:20:26,814
Back off!

1494
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:29,116
John, stop it!

1495
02:20:29,826 --> 02:20:31,139
Let him go! Back off!

1496
02:20:31,332 --> 02:20:32,310
John, let him go!

1497
02:20:47,587 --> 02:20:49,179
Oh, my God!

1498
02:21:30,821 --> 02:21:33,439
Easy, now. Easy.

1499
02:21:34,657 --> 02:21:35,999
Easy.

1500
02:21:46,175 --> 02:21:47,556
Are you all right?

1501
02:22:18,974 --> 02:22:20,949
Boy, what you looking at?

1502
02:22:28,478 --> 02:22:32,026
What you looking at? You limp noodle.

1503
02:22:32,324 --> 02:22:36,351
You wanna kiss my ass?
You wanna suck my dick?

1504
02:22:56,865 --> 02:22:59,032
Grab the gun! Grab the gun!

1505
02:23:58,819 --> 02:24:01,274
I punished them bad men.

1506
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:03,451
I punished them both.

1507
02:24:03,682 --> 02:24:04,890
Why?

1508
02:24:05,763 --> 02:24:06,971
Why Wild Bill?

1509
02:24:08,256 --> 02:24:12,379
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1510
02:24:13,282 --> 02:24:15,104
I saw what Wild Billy'd done.

1511
02:24:15,679 --> 02:24:17,980
Saw it plain as day.

1512
02:24:19,045 --> 02:24:21,787
You can't hide what's in your heart.

1513
02:24:22,086 --> 02:24:23,198
What?

1514
02:24:24,963 --> 02:24:26,075
You saw what?

1515
02:24:29,796 --> 02:24:31,829
Take my hand, boss.

1516
02:24:34,850 --> 02:24:36,537
You see for yourself.

1517
02:24:40,067 --> 02:24:41,112
No.

1518
02:24:44,997 --> 02:24:46,339
Please.

1519
02:24:54,405 --> 02:24:55,997
No, no.

1520
02:24:56,927 --> 02:24:57,723
Please.

1521
02:24:57,925 --> 02:25:02,394
I gots to, boss. I gots to
give you a little bit of myself.

1522
02:25:04,063 --> 02:25:05,444
A gift.

1523
02:25:06,719 --> 02:25:10,775
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

1524
02:26:06,237 --> 02:26:07,550
Suppertime!

1525
02:26:07,906 --> 02:26:09,689
Bring the girls!

1526
02:26:13,027 --> 02:26:15,836
Girls! You heard your mama!

1527
02:26:16,671 --> 02:26:19,289
Yes, Papa! We're coming!

1528
02:26:36,897 --> 02:26:40,311
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

1529
02:26:40,638 --> 02:26:42,297
Come get you some supper.

1530
02:26:45,126 --> 02:26:49,144
God is great, God is good,
and we thank You....

1531
02:27:12,545 --> 02:27:17,081
You love your sister? You make
any noise, you know what happens?

1532
02:27:17,283 --> 02:27:19,287
I'm gonna kill her instead of you.

1533
02:27:19,517 --> 02:27:22,873
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her. You understand?

1534
02:27:23,075 --> 02:27:24,638
You understand?

1535
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:46,226
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1536
02:27:47,425 --> 02:27:49,659
Now you see how it is.

1537
02:27:50,916 --> 02:27:53,697
That's the way it is every day.

1538
02:27:53,918 --> 02:27:57,917
That's the way it is all over the world.

1539
02:28:07,747 --> 02:28:08,667
Percy.

1540
02:28:08,898 --> 02:28:10,144
Percy Wetmore.

1541
02:28:11,037 --> 02:28:11,986
Son?

1542
02:28:14,911 --> 02:28:16,157
Son?

1543
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:19,667
-Son, can you hear me?
-Speak up if you can hear us.

1544
02:28:20,637 --> 02:28:23,571
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1545
02:28:25,278 --> 02:28:28,097
Percy, I got to ask you
a few questions.

1546
02:28:28,318 --> 02:28:31,454
One minute, he was fine,
and the next, blammo!

1547
02:28:31,685 --> 02:28:33,986
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars.

1548
02:28:34,178 --> 02:28:36,316
Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself.

1549
02:28:37,602 --> 02:28:40,383
See, we didn't even see it happen.

1550
02:28:44,162 --> 02:28:47,355
I'll cover for you as much as I can...

1551
02:28:47,557 --> 02:28:49,753
...even if it means my job.

1552
02:28:50,405 --> 02:28:52,160
But I have to know...

1553
02:28:52,544 --> 02:28:55,612
...does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

1554
02:28:58,403 --> 02:28:59,860
Does it, Paul?

1555
02:29:01,693 --> 02:29:02,910
No.

1556
02:30:26,750 --> 02:30:30,394
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1557
02:30:31,612 --> 02:30:33,271
Well, can he help?

1558
02:30:33,828 --> 02:30:36,503
Does he have the influence to do
something about this?

1559
02:30:36,705 --> 02:30:38,162
Stop the execution?

1560
02:30:38,402 --> 02:30:39,351
No.

1561
02:30:42,401 --> 02:30:43,829
Then don't tell him.

1562
02:30:44,483 --> 02:30:46,650
If it can't help, don't tell him.

1563
02:30:46,976 --> 02:30:48,184
Ever.

1564
02:30:50,429 --> 02:30:51,838
I won't.

1565
02:31:03,069 --> 02:31:05,341
There's no way out of this for you,
is there?

1566
02:31:06,751 --> 02:31:08,064
No.

1567
02:31:09,053 --> 02:31:11,508
And I've been thinking about it,
believe me.

1568
02:31:11,710 --> 02:31:14,913
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways.

1569
02:31:17,215 --> 02:31:19,257
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1570
02:31:20,734 --> 02:31:25,375
I've done some things in my life
that I am not proud of...

1571
02:31:25,923 --> 02:31:30,593
...but this is the first time I've
ever felt real danger of hell.

1572
02:31:31,552 --> 02:31:32,865
Hell?

1573
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:40,059
Talk to him.

1574
02:31:41,181 --> 02:31:42,936
Talk to John.

1575
02:31:44,643 --> 02:31:46,580
Find out what he wants.

1576
02:32:02,817 --> 02:32:03,996
Hello, boss.

1577
02:32:04,965 --> 02:32:06,240
Hello, John.

1578
02:32:07,612 --> 02:32:09,913
I guess you know we're
coming down to it now.

1579
02:32:10,652 --> 02:32:12,311
Another couple of days.

1580
02:32:25,316 --> 02:32:27,991
Is there anything special
you wanna eat that night?

1581
02:32:28,385 --> 02:32:30,590
We can rustle you up most anything.

1582
02:32:40,478 --> 02:32:44,956
Meat loaf be nice.
Mashed taters, gravy.

1583
02:32:45,216 --> 02:32:46,558
Okra.

1584
02:32:47,613 --> 02:32:50,336
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make...

1585
02:32:51,133 --> 02:32:53,108
...if she don't mind.

1586
02:32:55,324 --> 02:32:56,666
Now...

1587
02:32:57,185 --> 02:33:01,884
...what about a preacher?
Somebody to say a little prayer with.

1588
02:33:02,076 --> 02:33:04,157
Don't want no preacher.

1589
02:33:05,154 --> 02:33:07,570
You can say a prayer, if you like.

1590
02:33:08,194 --> 02:33:09,268
Me?

1591
02:33:12,165 --> 02:33:14,879
Suppose I could, if it came to that.

1592
02:33:22,753 --> 02:33:25,438
I have to ask you something
very important now.

1593
02:33:27,039 --> 02:33:29,148
I know what you gonna say.

1594
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,028
You don't have to say it.

1595
02:33:31,365 --> 02:33:34,558
No, I do. I do.
I have to say it.

1596
02:33:38,337 --> 02:33:40,571
Tell me what you want me to do.

1597
02:33:41,444 --> 02:33:43,352
You want me to take you out of here?

1598
02:33:44,542 --> 02:33:48,378
Just let you run away?
See how far you could get?

1599
02:33:49,788 --> 02:33:52,377
Why would you do such a foolish thing?

1600
02:33:54,305 --> 02:33:56,347
On the day of my judgment...

1601
02:33:57,124 --> 02:33:59,224
...when I stand before God...

1602
02:33:59,426 --> 02:34:03,099
...and He asks me why did l...

1603
02:34:03,291 --> 02:34:05,813
...did I kill one of His true...

1604
02:34:06,657 --> 02:34:08,153
...miracles...

1605
02:34:09,275 --> 02:34:11,356
...what am I going to say?

1606
02:34:12,258 --> 02:34:13,917
That it was my job?

1607
02:34:15,998 --> 02:34:17,906
It's my job.

1608
02:34:18,204 --> 02:34:22,644
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1609
02:34:25,665 --> 02:34:28,148
I know you're hurting and worrying.

1610
02:34:28,801 --> 02:34:32,311
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

1611
02:34:33,443 --> 02:34:36,310
I want it to be over and done with.

1612
02:34:36,963 --> 02:34:38,391
I do.

1613
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:44,568
I'm tired, boss.

1614
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:50,110
Tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1615
02:34:51,262 --> 02:34:53,918
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with...

1616
02:34:54,465 --> 02:34:58,866
...to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

1617
02:34:59,682 --> 02:35:03,738
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1618
02:35:04,804 --> 02:35:08,592
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world...

1619
02:35:08,803 --> 02:35:10,395
...every day.

1620
02:35:10,750 --> 02:35:12,639
There's too much of it.

1621
02:35:12,956 --> 02:35:16,638
It's like pieces of glass
in my head...

1622
02:35:16,830 --> 02:35:19,035
...all the time.

1623
02:35:20,484 --> 02:35:22,450
Can you understand?

1624
02:35:25,279 --> 02:35:28,127
Yes, John, I think I can.

1625
02:35:30,400 --> 02:35:33,660
Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

1626
02:35:35,742 --> 02:35:37,688
There must be something that you want.

1627
02:35:46,723 --> 02:35:51,029
I ain't never seen me a flicker show.

1628
02:35:51,518 --> 02:35:53,560
Heaven

1629
02:35:53,763 --> 02:35:55,834
i'm in heaven

1630
02:35:56,707 --> 02:36:01,339
And my heart beats so
That i can hardly speak

1631
02:36:03,104 --> 02:36:07,736
And i seem to find
The happiness i seek

1632
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:13,912
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

1633
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:15,769
Why, they's angels.

1634
02:37:16,643 --> 02:37:19,194
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1635
02:38:17,378 --> 02:38:19,286
I'll be all right, fellas.

1636
02:38:20,639 --> 02:38:22,806
This here's the hard part.

1637
02:38:24,063 --> 02:38:25,520
I'll be all right in a while.

1638
02:38:28,225 --> 02:38:30,967
I should have this just for now.

1639
02:38:34,814 --> 02:38:37,154
I'll give it back after.

1640
02:38:40,098 --> 02:38:44,499
You know, I fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1641
02:38:45,660 --> 02:38:47,673
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

1642
02:38:48,797 --> 02:38:49,976
Did you, John?

1643
02:38:50,715 --> 02:38:54,944
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1644
02:38:55,136 --> 02:38:57,341
That Mouseville place.

1645
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:59,834
I dreamed there's kids.

1646
02:39:00,382 --> 02:39:03,681
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1647
02:39:06,078 --> 02:39:09,722
I dreamed that those two little
blonde-headed girls was there.

1648
02:39:09,915 --> 02:39:11,708
They's laughing too.

1649
02:39:11,900 --> 02:39:14,719
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1650
02:39:14,911 --> 02:39:18,804
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1651
02:39:19,035 --> 02:39:22,238
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1652
02:39:23,677 --> 02:39:26,976
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1653
02:39:44,478 --> 02:39:48,371
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1654
02:39:50,242 --> 02:39:52,217
I can feel it.

1655
02:39:52,419 --> 02:39:54,068
It's like bees stinging me.

1656
02:39:54,395 --> 02:39:56,667
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1657
02:39:57,914 --> 02:39:59,026
We don't hate you.

1658
02:40:00,417 --> 02:40:01,903
Can you feel that?

1659
02:40:04,062 --> 02:40:06,133
IKill him twice, you boys!

1660
02:40:06,881 --> 02:40:10,707
You go on and kill that raping
babykiller twice!

1661
02:40:10,909 --> 02:40:12,664
That'd be fine!

1662
02:40:28,671 --> 02:40:31,039
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1663
02:40:31,231 --> 02:40:32,477
Yes, sir.

1664
02:40:44,255 --> 02:40:45,271
Roll on one.

1665
02:40:52,963 --> 02:40:56,338
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1666
02:40:57,116 --> 02:40:59,293
I hope it hurts like hell.

1667
02:41:01,182 --> 02:41:03,637
John Coffey, you've been condemned
to die in the electric chair...

1668
02:41:03,839 --> 02:41:05,047
...by a jury of your peers.

1669
02:41:05,277 --> 02:41:08,537
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1670
02:41:08,989 --> 02:41:12,086
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1671
02:41:13,755 --> 02:41:16,181
I'm sorry for what I am.

1672
02:41:27,709 --> 02:41:29,368
Please, boss...

1673
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:33,299
...don't put that thing over my face.

1674
02:41:34,461 --> 02:41:36,695
Don't put me in the dark.

1675
02:41:37,434 --> 02:41:39,678
I's afraid of the dark.

1676
02:41:48,961 --> 02:41:50,553
All right, John.

1677
02:42:09,916 --> 02:42:12,821
Heaven, i'm in heaven

1678
02:42:13,024 --> 02:42:15,738
Heaven, heaven

1679
02:42:15,929 --> 02:42:17,693
i'm in heaven

1680
02:42:18,241 --> 02:42:20,724
Heaven, heaven

1681
02:42:20,955 --> 02:42:22,585
i'm in heaven

1682
02:42:42,658 --> 02:42:44,182
John Coffey...

1683
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:48,181
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1684
02:42:48,383 --> 02:42:50,454
...in accordance with state law.

1685
02:42:52,737 --> 02:42:56,314
May God have mercy on your soul.

1686
02:43:33,439 --> 02:43:35,289
You have to say it.

1687
02:43:36,891 --> 02:43:39,096
You have to give the order.

1688
02:43:56,379 --> 02:43:58,584
He killed them with they love.

1689
02:43:58,786 --> 02:44:03,418
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1690
02:44:16,634 --> 02:44:18,015
Roll on two.

1691
02:45:58,397 --> 02:46:01,628
it was the last execution
i ever took part in.

1692
02:46:01,917 --> 02:46:05,494
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1693
02:46:06,626 --> 02:46:11,123
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1694
02:46:11,354 --> 02:46:13,051
It was all right.

1695
02:46:13,665 --> 02:46:16,474
"Catch them young" became my motto.

1696
02:46:19,583 --> 02:46:20,657
You don't believe me.

1697
02:46:21,501 --> 02:46:23,927
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1698
02:46:24,704 --> 02:46:26,775
-It's just that--
-It's quite a story.

1699
02:46:26,977 --> 02:46:29,115
It's quite a story.

1700
02:46:29,499 --> 02:46:31,771
One thing I don't understand.

1701
02:46:31,992 --> 02:46:33,689
You said you and Jan...

1702
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:37,334
...had a grown son in 1 935.

1703
02:46:37,593 --> 02:46:39,021
Is that right?

1704
02:46:39,387 --> 02:46:41,276
The math doesn't work, does it?

1705
02:46:46,714 --> 02:46:49,207
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1706
02:47:09,021 --> 02:47:10,392
Watch your step.

1707
02:47:10,881 --> 02:47:13,115
Now let your eyes adjust.

1708
02:47:24,481 --> 02:47:25,459
There.

1709
02:47:29,113 --> 02:47:30,772
Wake up, old fella.

1710
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:32,248
Wake up.

1711
02:47:35,673 --> 02:47:39,384
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

1712
02:47:43,422 --> 02:47:44,697
Come over here, boy.

1713
02:47:45,177 --> 02:47:47,449
Come on over here and see this lady.

1714
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:53,136
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1715
02:48:14,878 --> 02:48:17,361
Go on, you can do it.

1716
02:48:24,162 --> 02:48:28,468
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1717
02:48:29,216 --> 02:48:33,013
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1718
02:48:39,199 --> 02:48:42,709
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1719
02:48:43,131 --> 02:48:47,801
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1720
02:48:47,994 --> 02:48:50,295
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1721
02:48:50,497 --> 02:48:53,757
And I think a part of...

1722
02:48:53,978 --> 02:48:56,529
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1723
02:48:56,798 --> 02:48:59,991
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1724
02:49:01,113 --> 02:49:03,021
As for me...

1725
02:49:04,153 --> 02:49:06,608
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1726
02:49:06,877 --> 02:49:08,948
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1727
02:49:09,275 --> 02:49:12,574
...so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1728
02:49:14,875 --> 02:49:17,013
When John did that...

1729
02:49:18,395 --> 02:49:20,629
...when he took my hand...

1730
02:49:21,598 --> 02:49:25,338
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1731
02:49:26,240 --> 02:49:28,023
...spilled into me.

1732
02:49:28,379 --> 02:49:30,134
He...what?

1733
02:49:30,556 --> 02:49:33,941
He infected you with life?

1734
02:49:35,456 --> 02:49:37,690
It's as good a word as any.

1735
02:49:39,129 --> 02:49:41,910
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1736
02:49:42,112 --> 02:49:43,512
With life.

1737
02:49:47,425 --> 02:49:50,388
I'm 1 08 years old, Elaine.

1738
02:49:50,619 --> 02:49:54,809
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1739
02:49:57,601 --> 02:50:01,206
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1740
02:50:01,437 --> 02:50:05,810
He was just a force of nature.

1741
02:50:06,232 --> 02:50:10,259
I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1742
02:50:11,257 --> 02:50:14,105
Another century come to pass.

1743
02:50:16,733 --> 02:50:21,010
But I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1744
02:50:21,375 --> 02:50:23,350
Hal and Melinda...

1745
02:50:23,773 --> 02:50:25,144
...Brutus Howell...

1746
02:50:25,336 --> 02:50:27,896
...my wife, my boy.

1747
02:50:30,716 --> 02:50:32,509
And you, Elaine.

1748
02:50:33,469 --> 02:50:35,195
You'll die too.

1749
02:50:36,633 --> 02:50:40,862
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

1750
02:50:42,234 --> 02:50:44,574
It's my atonement, you see.

1751
02:50:45,121 --> 02:50:46,770
It's my punishment...

1752
02:50:46,972 --> 02:50:49,494
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1753
02:50:51,134 --> 02:50:53,780
For killing a miracle of God.

1754
02:50:55,258 --> 02:50:57,914
Almighty, everlasting God...

1755
02:50:58,202 --> 02:51:00,503
...the source of all being and life.

1756
02:51:00,696 --> 02:51:04,858
You'll be gone like all the others.
i'll have to stay.

1757
02:51:06,776 --> 02:51:10,803
i'll die eventually.
Of that i'm sure.

1758
02:51:11,514 --> 02:51:15,350
i have no illusions of immortality.

1759
02:51:15,705 --> 02:51:18,093
But i will have wished for death...

1760
02:51:18,783 --> 02:51:20,883
...long before death finds me.

1761
02:51:21,948 --> 02:51:25,621
in truth, i wish for it already.

1762
02:51:37,216 --> 02:51:39,124
Mr. Jingles?

1763
02:51:47,736 --> 02:51:49,807
Where you been?

1764
02:51:50,239 --> 02:51:53,365
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1765
02:51:54,172 --> 02:51:56,502
Let's see if we can find you
something to eat.

1766
02:51:57,595 --> 02:52:01,172
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1767
02:52:02,554 --> 02:52:03,829
Look at you.

1768
02:52:05,469 --> 02:52:09,209
i lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

1769
02:52:09,401 --> 02:52:11,347
And i wait.

1770
02:52:12,221 --> 02:52:14,839
i think about all the people
i've loved...

1771
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:17,111
...now long gone.

1772
02:52:17,821 --> 02:52:20,151
i think about my beautiful Jan...

1773
02:52:20,344 --> 02:52:23,249
...how i lost her so many years ago.

1774
02:52:24,573 --> 02:52:29,013
And i think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...

1775
02:52:29,215 --> 02:52:31,766
...each in our own time.

1776
02:52:32,792 --> 02:52:35,860
But one thought
more than any other...

1777
02:52:36,062 --> 02:52:38,584
...keeps me awake most nights:

1778
02:52:39,707 --> 02:52:43,504
if he could make a mouse
live so long...

1779
02:52:43,994 --> 02:52:46,928
...how much longer do i have?

1780
02:52:50,112 --> 02:52:52,758
We each owe a death.

1781
02:52:52,961 --> 02:52:55,349
There are no exceptions.

1782
02:52:56,087 --> 02:52:58,005
But, oh, God...

1783
02:52:58,878 --> 02:53:00,594
...sometimes...

1784
02:53:01,180 --> 02:53:04,632
...the Green Mile seems so long.
