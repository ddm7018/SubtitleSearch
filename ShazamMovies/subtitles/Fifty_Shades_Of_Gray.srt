- Oh, yes.
- And you have all the questions?

- Yes
- And you know where you're going?

Yes, I do have a GPS, and a four point GPA.

- I can figure it out.
- You're wearing that?

- Christian Grey.
- I'm Anastasia Steele.

Miss Kavanagh has the flu, so she asked me to fill in.

I see, so you're studying journalism as well?

No. English literature
Kate's my roommate.

As I said, I only have 10 minutes

Thanks

00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:30,277
Yes I'm giving the commencement address

31
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:31,898
at this year's ceremony

00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:33,124
You are?

33
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:38,858
I mean um… I know

34
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:45,540
You are very young to have amassed an empire

35
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,894
- To what do you owe-
- To what do I owe my success?

00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:51,747
- Yep
- Seriously?

37
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,112
Yes.

38
00:05:56,018 --> 00:06:00,393
Business is about people, and I've always been good at people

39
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:04,841
What motivates them, what inspires them

40
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,721
Well maybe you're just lucky

41
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:14,753
I've always seen, the more hard eye work, the more luck I seem to have

42
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,147
The key to my success is identifying talents in individuals

43
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:23,309
- And harnessing their efforts
- You're a control freak?

44
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:26,033
Oh I exercise control in all things Miss Steele

45
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:35,070
Okay um, your company is involved primarily

46
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,030
in the telecommunications sector

47
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:41,127
Yet you also invest in numerous agricultural projects.

48
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:45,269
Including several in Africa.
Is that something you feel passionate about?

49
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,120
Feeding the world's poor?

50
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:48,701
Its smart business.

51
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,299
You don't agree?

52
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:56,040
I don't know enough about it.

53
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:07,286
I just wonder, if you're heart might be
a bit bigger than you want to let on?

54
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,571
But some people say I don't have a heart.

55
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,704
- Why would they say that?
- Because they know me well.

56
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:18,534
Continue.

57
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:23,428
Do you have any interests outside of work?

58
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:26,124
I enjoy various physical pursuits.

59
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:31,557
You're unmarried, oh
you were adopted at age four

60

Thats a matter of public record.

I'm sorry I didn't...

62
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:39,923
Do you have an actual question, Miss Steele?

63
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,968
Yes.

64
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:45,065
Are you gay?

65
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:53,012
Its written here, I'm just...

66
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:57,598
No, Anastasia. I'm not gay.

67
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:01,789
I apologise, Mr Grey
Kate can be a little-

68
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,166
- Intrusive?
- Curious

69
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,034
What about you?

70
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,865
Why don't you ask me something you wanna know?

71
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,960
Earlier you said that there are some
people who know you well.

72
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:32,710
Why do I have the feeling that that is not true?

73
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,264
Mr Grey, your next meeting is in the conference room

74
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:40,227
Cancel it please, we're not finished here

75
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:41,448
Yes sir.

76
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:44,384
No I um… I can go 

77
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,232
- Its fine
- I would like to know more about you.

78
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:51,716
There's not really much to know about me

79
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:57,438
You said you're in English literature?
Tell me was it Charlotte Brontë, Jane Austen

80
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:00,274
or Thomas Hardy, who made you fall in love
with literature?

81
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,107
Hardy.

82
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:08,411
I would've guessed Jane Austen.

83
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,094
What are your plans for after you graduate?

84
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:15,291

- Then I was planning on moving here

We offer an excellent internship program

88
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:28,661
I don't think I'd fit in here.

00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:37,965
So? What was he like?

- He was fine.
- Fine? Just fine?

He was very polite, and curteous,
very formal and clean.

The hot type of human?

113
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,929
I asked him if he was gay.
It was in your questions

114

Why would you do that to me?

115
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:56,596
Because whenever he's in the society pages

116
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:58,989
He's never been photographed with a woman
So naturally

117
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,591
Well maybe he just wants to keep
his private life private Kate.

00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,573
- That it?
- Masking tape.

162
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:14,917
- Are you redecorating?
- No.

163
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:21,731
We have one inch and two inch, but the truly self

164
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,395
respecting handyman would have both in his tool box.

165
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:26,022
Of course he will.

166
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,531
It's rare to find a connoisseur these days...

167
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:35,277
- Did you want anything else?
- Yes, rope.

168
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:42,040
Thats very impressive.
Do you girl scouts?

169
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:49,117
No, organised activity groups aren't 
really my thing.

170
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:55,375
- So what is your thing?
- I don't know… Books?

171
00:15:57,721 --> 00:16:04,748
Okay, rope, tape, cable ties
You're like a complete serial killer.

172
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:08,460
- Not today.
- Anything else?

173
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:12,837
- What would you recommend?
- For a do-it-yourselfer?

174
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:16,904
Maybe coveralls, to protect all your clothes?

175
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:23,702
- Or I could just take all my clothes off.
- Okay, no clothes

176
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:29,491
I mean, no coveralls
I can't think of anything else

177
00:16:31,067 --> 00:16:33,975
- I guess that must be it
- Cool. 

178
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,249
Thank you for answering
Kate's questions by the way. 

179
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:40,425
- She was thrilled.
- I hope she's feeling better. 

180
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,483
Yeah she is, she's just having
trouble finding an original photo
of you. 

181
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:46,733
If she'd like an original, I'm around tomorrow.

182
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,176
- You'd be willing to do that?
- Yeah. 

183
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:54,205
- Do you want me to bag for you Ana?
- No, I'm good, thanks though Paul. 

184
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,489
Okay. 

185
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,181
I'm staying at the Heathman.
Call me before 10. 

186
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,880
- About the photos. 
- Oh, yeah, I will.

187
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:16,988
Enjoy your...

188
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:38,986
Thanks for doing this again Mr Grey. 

189
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:43,163
- I'm happy to help. 
- How about we try a few with a smile?

190
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:49,513
Or not.

191
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,479
You do realise he hasn't
stopped looking at you?

192
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,939
He asked me to go for coffee afterwards.

193
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:58,128
What?

194
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,238
Kate shh… 

195
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:03,371
Is he your boyfriend?

196
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,468
- Who?
- The photographer. 

197
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:12,240
- Jose? No.
- I've seen the way he was smiling at you. 

198
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,854
No Jose is more like family. He's
not my boyfriend. 

199
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:22,237
- And the guy at the store?
- Paul? No.

200
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,672
Thank you. 

201
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:44,399
- You seem nervous. 
- I find you intimidating. 

202
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,028
You should. 

203
00:18:49,415 --> 00:18:52,601
- Eat.
- Not to mention high-handed. 

204
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:56,083
I'm used to getting my own way. 

205
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:57,425
Then you must get very boring. 

206
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:05,488
- Tell me about your family.
- My family? Okay. 

207
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,345
My dad died when I was a baby. 

208
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:11,016
So I was raised by my step-father Ray. 

209
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,008
- He's amazing. 
- And your mom?

210
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:23,824
My mother is on husband number four.
She's an incurable romantic. 

211
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:27,269
- And you?
- Am I romantic?

212
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:32,855
Well I study English Literature.
I kind of have to be. 

213
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,660
But the photo shoot went well right?
Kate seems to be really happy. 

214
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:42,970
- I'm sorry, I can't. 
- What?

215
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,403
I'll walk you out. 

216
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:53,716
- Do you have a girlfriend, is that it?
- I don't do the girlfriend thing. 

217
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:55,706
- What does that even mean?
- Watch it!

218
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:13,072
I'm not the man for you. 
You should steer clear of me. 

219
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,658
I have to let you go. 

220
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:23,348
Goodbye Mr Grey. 

221
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:30,381
Alright pencils down. 

222
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,235
Please take your final exams to the
back of the classroom

223
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,505
Final grades will be posted
in two weeks. 

224
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:41,270
- Hey, you all good?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

225
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,800
- We are so partying tonight
- Oh my god. 

226
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:46,768
This is way too much. 

227
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:49,632
No, we're getting exactly the
right amount. 

228
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:51,939
- All over my face?
- Thats the idea. 

229
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:56,760
- Wow, no Kate. 
- Cab's early, lets go. 

230
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,124
Ana, there's a package for you. 

231
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,442
<i>"Why didn't you tell me there was danger?
Why didn't you warn me?</i>

232
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,868
<i>"Ladies know what to guard against</i>

233
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,459
<i>- "... because they read novels that tells them of these tricks "</i>

234
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,845
Thats a quote from Tess of the d'Urberville.

235
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:17,143
Oh my god. 

236
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:18,941
These must be from Christian. 

237
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,164
I mean…

238
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:26,221
These are incredible.

239
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,016
Wow, Grey. 

240
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:35,123
Kate these are first editions
I can't, this is too much. 

241
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:38,220
I can't accept them, I have to send them back. 

242
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:41,966
Thats the cab, okay, are you ready?

243
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:45,163
- Are you really though?
- Yes, yes, very.

- Did you do it all?
- Alright!

248
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,631
With my right eye closed and left handed,
I can get this in.

- What?

Wait what did Kate say?

She warned me to be on my best behaviour.

- More like threatened me.

Did you put me to bed?

302
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:16,629
- You undressed me? 
- I didn't have much choice

00:27:18,006 --> 00:27:19,265
Where did you sleep?

- So we just slept then?
- It was a novelty for me too.

You - need to eat.
I had Taylor pick you up some clothes.

00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:08,124
If you were mine you wouldn't
be able to sit down for a week. 

314
00:28:08,951 --> 00:28:10,162
What?

315
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:15,142
I gotta go take a shower.

316
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:24,938
Why am I here Christian?

317
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:31,621
You're here because I'm incapable
of leaving you alone.

318
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:35,989
Then don't. 

319
00:28:41,162 --> 00:28:45,627
- Why'd you send me those books?
- I thought I owed you an apology.

320
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,507
- For what?
- For letting you believe that I...

321
00:28:55,418 --> 00:29:00,744
Listen to me. I don't do romance

322
00:29:04,382 --> 00:29:10,813
My tastes are very - singular.
You wouldn't understand.

323
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:20,736
Enlighten me then. 

324
00:29:58,021 --> 00:30:02,930
- You look beautiful.
- Taylor has good taste. 

325
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:10,944
- What are you doing here later?
- I'm working at the hardware store till 7.

326
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:13,315
I'll have Taylor pick you up then. 

327
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,268
I'd like to bite that lip. 

328
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,126
I think I'd like that. 

329
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,893
I'm not gonna touch you, not
until I have your written consent.

330
00:30:29,998 --> 00:30:31,116
What?

331
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:34,210
I'll explain later.
Come I'll take you home. 

332
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:49,283
Fuck the paperwork. 

333
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:14,943
What is it about elevators?

334
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,251
Hey

335
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:32,474
- Hi, you must be Ana.
- You must be Elliot.

336
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:34,152
And we must be going, Elliot.

337
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:38,093
So awesome your place.
Kate's told me a lot about you. 

338
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:41,182
Elliot grab your shoes, some of us
have work to return to.

339
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:44,418
What you're doing with Mr. Worm here,
I've got no idea. 

340
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:48,854
Laters baby. 

341
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:54,928
I'll see you tonight, email
me if something changes. 

342
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:56,504
My computer's broken. 

343
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,127
Well call then, you know
you have my number.

344
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:02,300
Laters baby. 

345
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:12,142
- Elliot seems really nice. 
- No, no. We're starting with you. 

346
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:15,490
If you're seeing him again tonight,
this means that something happened. 

347
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,716
- Ana? Tell me what happened...
- I have to get ready for work. 

348
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:25,892
We just kissed. Once.

349
00:32:26,516 --> 00:32:29,365
Only once? Thats odd.

350
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,060
- Odd doesn't even cover it. 
- Uh huh, and a new jacket.

351
00:32:51,858 --> 00:32:52,858
Bye. 

352
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,693
Hi, its Taylor right?

353
00:32:56,717 --> 00:33:00,106
Good evening Miss Steele, Mr
Grey will be joining us there. 

354
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,198
<i>GREY ENTERPRISES</i>

355
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:16,961
Good evening, Anastasia.

356
00:33:33,068 --> 00:33:34,688
What, you're flying this?

357
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,674
No escaping now. 

358
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:02,683
November 1-2-2-4. Charlie Tango.
Ready to depart. 

359
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,365
<i>Charlie tango, your flight plan to
Seattle has been cleared..</i>

360
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:08,035
Seattle? Thats where we're going?

361
00:35:10,886 --> 00:35:13,683
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes please. 

362
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:43,843
- You play?
- Yes. 

363
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:48,271
Of course you do.

364
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:59,993
- Whats this?
- Its a nondisclosure agreement. 

365
00:36:01,238 --> 00:36:05,253
It means you cannot discuss anything
about us with anyone. 

366
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:08,562
I'm afraid my lawyer insists on it. 

367
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:11,201
I would never talk to anyone 
about us anyway. 

368
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:25,188
Are you gonna make love to me now?

369
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,630
Two things: First, I don't make love

370
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,706
I fuck - hard. 

371
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:47,615
- And the second?
- Come. 

372
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:04,431
- Its just around this door.
- What is it?

373
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:08,506
- My playroom. 
- Like your xbox and stuff?

374
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,469
Its important you know that you
can leave at any time.

375
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:13,862
Why, whats in there?

376
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:17,370
I meant what I said, the helicopter

377
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:19,337
is not standby, for whenever you
wanna go. 

378
00:37:19,566 --> 00:37:21,150
Just open the door. 

379
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,439
Oh my god. 

380
00:38:20,376 --> 00:38:21,736
Its called a flogger. 

381
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:34,148
Say something please. 

382
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:42,219
Do women do this to you or...
383
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:44,932
I do this to women. With women. 

384
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,642
Women who want me to. 

385
00:38:57,478 --> 00:39:00,966
- You're a sadist?
- I'm a dominant. 

386
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,346
What does that mean?

387
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,225
It means I want you to willingly
surrender yourself to me. 

388
00:39:06,282 --> 00:39:07,866
Why would I do that?

389
00:39:08,853 --> 00:39:13,711
- To please me.
- Please you? How?

390
00:39:13,735 --> 00:39:17,892
I have rules, if you follow them,
I'll reward you.

391
00:39:18,216 --> 00:39:20,642
If you don't, I'll punish you. 

392
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:24,263
You'd punish me, you'd use this stuff on me?

393
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:29,657
- Yes. 
- What would I get out of this?

394
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:33,870
Me. 

395
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:52,243
If we were to do this, this would be your room. 

396
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,392
You can decorate it however you like. 

397
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:58,772
You want me to move in?

398
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,891
Not full time, just Friday through to Sunday

399
00:40:02,115 --> 00:40:09,167
- We can negotiate the particulars
- So - I'd sleep in here with you?

400
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:14,153
No I sleep downstairs. I told you
I don't sleep with anyone. 

401
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:19,164
What if I don't want anything to
do with that? 

402
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:21,037
Then I understand completely. 

403
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,358
But then we wouldn't have
any sort of relationship at all?

404
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:27,050
This is the only sort of 
relationship I have. 

405
00:40:28,555 --> 00:40:34,265
- Why?
- Its the way I am. 

406
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:46,553
When you said negotiate, what did you mean?

407
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:50,276
I already have the contract prepared. 
Fairly detailed. 

408
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:56,337
You would review, and negotiate what
you are and not willing to try. 

409
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:58,818
How can I know what I'd
be willing to try?

410
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:03,743
Well when you had sex, was there
anything you didn't like doing?

411
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,107
We have to be honest with each other
for this to work,

412
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:10,131
Okay?

413
00:41:13,078 --> 00:41:19,489
- I… I wouldn't know. 
- What do you mean?

414
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:27,523
- Because I haven't...
- You're still a virgin?

415
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:31,649
- I've just shown you-
- I know, I know. 

416
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:35,904
- You've done other things right?
- No.

417
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:48,932
- Where have you been?
- Waiting.

418
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,335
Guys must throw themselves at you. 

419
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,586
They're never what I've wanted. 

420
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:03,937
Stop biting your lip. 

421
00:42:16,174 --> 00:42:19,448
- What are you doing?
- Rectifying the situation. 

422
00:42:19,572 --> 00:42:20,990
The situation?

423
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:26,783
You're energetic this morning.

424
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:31,476
- You hungry?
- Very. 

425
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:37,213
Because I'm making pancakes. 

426
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:46,640
Lets get you cleaned up. 

427
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:38,271
Do you trust me?

428
00:46:50,336 --> 00:46:51,601
Stay here. 

429
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,679
Hold out your wrists. 

430
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:29,795
Hold them there. Understand?

431
00:47:31,604 --> 00:47:36,529
- Tell me you understand. 
- I won't move my arms.

432
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:38,651
Good girl. 

433
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:51,081
- Stay still.
- Okay. 

434
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:03,859
- Say yes. 
- To what. 

435
00:48:03,883 --> 00:48:05,486
Being mine. 

436
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,822
<i>Christian!</i>

437
00:48:11,846 --> 00:48:14,297
- Shit. 
- Its my mother. 

438
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:20,101
- I'm naked. 
- Get dressed. 

439
00:48:22,314 --> 00:48:26,919
No need to show me around, no
need to hover. 

440
00:48:26,943 --> 00:48:30,441
- He's sleeping Dr. Grey. 
- Still sleeping? He never sleeps in.

441
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:31,898
Certainly not at this hour. 

442
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:33,542
Unless of course he's ill is he? Ah. 

443
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:37,019
- Sorry Mr. Grey. 
- Its fine I know how she can be.

444
00:48:37,043 --> 00:48:41,778
She? Darling you can try to avoid me, but 
the least you can do is

445
00:48:41,813 --> 00:48:44,083
Call me by my correct name, which is mama. 

446
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:47,634
- Hi. 
- Oh, dear god. 

447
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:50,345
Mother, Anastasia Steele.
Ana, meet my mother

448
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:51,936
Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey.

449
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,471
You have no idea how delighted I am to meet you.

450
00:48:55,495 --> 00:48:57,673
Its nice to meet you too Dr. Grey. 

451
00:48:57,697 --> 00:49:00,204
Grace. She's very pretty. 

452
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:01,482
You are very pretty. 

453
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:02,506
Thanks. 

454
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:05,702
What happened to calling before 
dropping by?

455
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:09,173
And have your head-henchman give
me the run around here, no thank you. 

456
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:13,145
I'll take my chances. Well I was in the
neighbourhood and I  thought perhaps
457
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:14,507
we could have lunch. 

458
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:16,797
I can't today, I have to drive Ana home. 

459
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:21,437
Its okay, take it - I was just showing mother out.

460
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:22,472
Excuse me. 

461
00:49:23,901 --> 00:49:25,134
Anastasia!

462
00:49:25,158 --> 00:49:26,784
- Kate, wait
- It was a joy to meet you. 

463
00:49:27,308 --> 00:49:30,148
I'm having the whole family 
for dinner at my house. 

464
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,785
Christian's sister Mia is back
from Paris, so lets come.

465
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:35,231
We'll see mother. 

466
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:37,446
- Nice to meet you.
- You too. 

467
00:49:39,586 --> 00:49:40,586
Kate.

468
00:49:41,614 --> 00:49:42,887
Thank you. 

469
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:50,178
I can't talk about it right now Kate.

470
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,526
I gotta go, I'll call you back okay?

471
00:50:15,948 --> 00:50:17,756
Everything okay with the phone call?

472
00:50:19,959 --> 00:50:23,538
Yeah, nothing important.
I liked your mom. 

473
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:27,827
She's excited. She's never seen
me with a woman before. 

474
00:50:28,451 --> 00:50:30,044
You're the first. 

475
00:50:35,629 --> 00:50:37,167
What is it Ana?

476
00:50:39,061 --> 00:50:43,177
I just… How many women have stayed in here?

477
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:46,349
15. 

478
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:52,661
-Thats a lot of women. 
- I told you before, if you want out-

479
00:50:52,685 --> 00:50:56,113
I don't want out, I'm just not jumping
at the opportunity

480
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,849
for whips, torture and your red room
of pain. 

481
00:50:58,873 --> 00:51:02,174
The red room is much more about pleasure.
I promise you. 

482
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:09,726
Will we still go out to dinner, and movies...

483
00:51:10,899 --> 00:51:12,562
Thats not really my thing. 

484
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:16,469
Try to keep an open mind. 

485
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:24,168
If you agree to be my submissive,
I will be devoted to you. 

486
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:30,066
This is what I want.
And I want it with you.

487
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,283
Why do I have to sleep in here?
We slept in the same bed last night. 

488
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:42,049
Like normal people. 

489
00:51:42,473 --> 00:51:45,501
Try not to get hung up on the 
sleeping arrangements. 

490
00:51:46,276 --> 00:51:49,157
If you agree to do this,
you're gonna want your own room

491
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,648
Why, because I'll be your sex slave?

492
00:51:52,257 --> 00:51:55,262
I don't wanna do this here,
lets talk downstairs. 

493
00:51:55,286 --> 00:51:59,284
No. I think I'll hold on to my
freewill a little while longer thank you. 

494
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,027
Actually you know what, I would like
to go home, can I go home?

495
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:13,248
- Which one's yours?
- All of them. 

496
00:53:03,543 --> 00:53:05,172
Lets go for a walk. 

497
00:53:07,925 --> 00:53:12,983
- How did you start doing this?
- One of my mother's friends. 

498
00:53:14,651 --> 00:53:18,230
- I was 15.
- She seduced you?

499
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:25,680
- I was her submissive for six years.
- Seriously, does your mother know that?

500
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:30,242
Of course not. No one in my family
knows about this

501
00:53:30,966 --> 00:53:32,455
Part of me. 

502
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,737
So she introduced you to all of this?
Mrs Robinson?

503
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:44,805
Mrs Robinson? I'll tell her you said that.
She'll love it. 

504
00:53:45,729 --> 00:53:51,495
- You still talk to her?
- On occasions. We're friends. 

505
00:53:56,692 --> 00:54:04,498
Ana. I know how intimidating this is.
I felt the same at first. 

506
00:54:04,522 --> 00:54:09,133
Well… What made you change your mind?

507
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:18,235
By giving up control, I felt free,
from responsibilities.

508
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:22,288
From making decisions.
I felt safe. 

509
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,107
You will too, you'll see. 

510
00:54:27,913 --> 00:54:30,850
I never took anyone in the helicopter. 

511
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:37,129
Never had sex in my own bed.
Never slept with anyone. 

512
00:54:37,453 --> 00:54:41,414
Ever. Only you. 

513
00:55:05,745 --> 00:55:08,649
This is the contract.
Read it carefully. 

514
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,093
Email me if you have any questions. 

515
00:55:11,539 --> 00:55:13,503
I told you, my computer's down. 

516
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:14,951
Just consider it okay?

517
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:22,505
I really hope you say yes. 

518
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,257
- Thanks for the ride. 
- Laters baby. 

519
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:43,780
- Um.
- Okay, you're all set. 

520
00:55:44,204 --> 00:55:46,362
- Your roommate let me in. 
- I just figured you forgot to tell me about it

521
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:49,369
- Do I look okay?
- Tell you about what?

522
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:52,074
- Just sign here. 
- Hold on, do you have the right apartment?

523
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,756
Anastasia Steele?

524
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:03,291
- Enjoy. 
- Another gift huh?

525
00:56:03,315 --> 00:56:05,835
What happened to flowers and chocolate?

526
00:56:05,859 --> 00:56:07,787
I'm dying to hear everything, but

527
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,969
I have to run right now, cause Elliot
and I are having dinner

528
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:11,506
And then we're seeing a show at the Gorge. 

529
00:56:11,565 --> 00:56:14,553
Jose called for you, twice, by the way. 

530
00:56:14,777 --> 00:56:19,019
- Is that some article?
- No... These are

531
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,363
These are my thesis notes, I 
left them at school. 

532
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,594
Oh okay, well there's yesterday's mail. 

533
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:37,770
- What?
- I don't know. You look - different. 

534
00:56:38,547 --> 00:56:41,968
- I feel different. 
- Of course you do
535
00:56:43,908 --> 00:56:46,365
- Okay.
- Bye.

536
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,554
Bye. 

537
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:06,349

<i>to the dominant, and so only address him

Its been nice knowing me has it?

578
01:00:24,274 --> 01:00:27,853
Let me remind you, how nice it was.

579
01:00:35,824 --> 01:00:37,304
Is this what you want?

580
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:06,593
Don't make a sound.

581
01:02:07,928 --> 01:02:09,208
That was really nice.

582
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,112
What are you doing to me?

583
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:37,029
What about here?

584
01:02:39,898 --> 01:02:43,276
Why not? Is that breaking the rules?

585
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:51,219
- Speaking of which...
- I haven't made up my mind yet.

586
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:01,919
- You're not staying?
- I told you. I don't sleep with anyone.

587
01:03:04,132 --> 01:03:05,731
Can we negotiate?

588

<i>TENGO UNAS DUDAS CON EL PAPELEO.</i>

595
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:40,599
Business meeting.

596
01:04:55,596 --> 01:04:59,702
<i>Mr Christian Grey: Dominant.
Miss Anastasia Steele: Submissive.</i>

597
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:09,751
- Impressive.
- I've done this before.

598
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:15,893
- Business meetings I mean.
- Oh.

599
01:05:16,517 --> 01:05:19,368
Miss Steele. Your meeting. 

600
01:05:21,449 --> 01:05:25,619
Page 1 - strike out my old address
and replace it with the new one.

601
01:05:25,943 --> 01:05:28,069
An oversight. Do go on. 

602
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:31,130
Page 3, section 15-20

603
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:35,352
"The submissive shall submit to
any sexual activity"

604
01:05:35,376 --> 01:05:40,044
"... demanded by the dominant without
hesitation or argument."

605
01:05:47,146 --> 01:05:51,367
Turn to page 5, appendix 3, soft limits

606
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:55,189
- With you. 
- Find anal fisting. 

607
01:05:55,513 --> 01:05:58,150
- I'm all ears.
- Strike it out. 

608
01:06:03,012 --> 01:06:05,322
Strike out vaginal fisting too.

609
01:06:05,746 --> 01:06:07,981
- You sure?
- Yep.

610
01:06:10,187 --> 01:06:11,228
Same page. 

611
01:06:11,252 --> 01:06:13,964
"Is the use of sex toys acceptable
to the submissive"

612
01:06:13,988 --> 01:06:16,838
Vibrators - okay
Dildos - fine

613
01:06:17,594 --> 01:06:20,917
Genital clamps - absolutely not.

614
01:06:21,241 --> 01:06:27,246
- Consider them gone. 
- What are butt plugs?

615
01:06:42,717 --> 01:06:45,795
You must go through quite a few
non-disclosure agreements. 

616
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:49,101
My staff know only what I 
choose to tell them. 

617
01:06:49,832 --> 01:06:51,785
Please resume Miss Steele.

618
01:06:54,964 --> 01:06:58,728
Also, on page 5, there are some terms
which need clarification.

619
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:03,676
- Suspension
- Hanging on a rope from the ceiling. 

620
01:07:04,707 --> 01:07:07,875
- For what possible reason?
- For your pleasure.

621
01:07:08,473 --> 01:07:13,214
- Really?
- And mine - something to consider

622
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,762
No. Hard limit. 

623
01:07:16,881 --> 01:07:21,537
"Is bondage acceptable to the submissive?"
- I'm good with rope

624
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:26,212
Leather casts, hand cuffs...
Please lose tape.

625
01:07:27,939 --> 01:07:33,514
- And whats others?
- Cable ties?

626
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:40,433
Can I just say how impressed I am
with your commitment to this meeting?

627
01:07:41,905 --> 01:07:45,913
And in that spirit, I'm gonna offer
something sweeter. 

628
01:07:46,895 --> 01:07:52,227
How about, once a week, on a night
of your choosing, we go on a date. 

629
01:07:53,413 --> 01:08:00,318
Just like a regular couple - dinner
movie, ice skating

630
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:05,435
- Whatever you want
- Accepted. 

631
01:08:06,235 --> 01:08:10,830
- You're very kind.
- I'll suggest it in Appendix 5.

632
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:28,990
I would like to fuck you into
the middle of next week. 

633
01:08:31,969 --> 01:08:35,823
- You're not fighting fair.
- I never have. 

634
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:42,219
I'll review all these changes and
try to arrive at a decision.

635
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,334
- You wanna leave?
- Yes. 

636
01:08:45,558 --> 01:08:50,856
But your body tells me something different.
Your legs for instance. 

637
01:08:51,932 --> 01:08:54,910
The way you're pressing your thighs
together under the table. 

638
01:08:56,551 --> 01:09:02,057
The change in your breathing.
And then your complexion. 

639
01:09:02,281 --> 01:09:05,091
- My complexion?
- You're flushed. 

640
01:09:06,076 --> 01:09:09,039
- That could just be the wine.
- Its the adrenaline. 

641
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:23,428
Say I did stay. What would happen?

642
01:09:24,252 --> 01:09:29,014
First, I would help you out of
that little dress of yours

643
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:32,788
- Yes?
- Then I'd be pleased to discover

644
01:09:32,812 --> 01:09:35,818
- ... that you are naked underneath.
- Really?

645
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,895
- Then I would bend you over.
- Right here?

646
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:46,102
- Yes.
- On this table?

647
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:48,561
Yes. 

648
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:09,602
Thank you for the meeting Mr. Grey

649
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:21,928
This is me. 

650
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:26,767
Didn't know I was a collector 
of classic cars huh?

651
01:10:29,344 --> 01:10:32,048
You're sure I can't persuade 
you to stay?

652
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,619
Goodnight, Christian.

653
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:37,674
- When will you know?
- Soon, maybe. 

654
01:10:47,266 --> 01:10:49,384
Why do I think you're telling me goodbye?

655
01:10:50,809 --> 01:10:51,875
Because I'm leaving. 

656
01:10:59,145 --> 01:11:01,178
You got your speech ready yet?

657
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:02,213
More or less.

658
01:11:02,465 --> 01:11:04,237
- Annie.
- Dad!

659
01:11:06,355 --> 01:11:07,355
Hi. 

660
01:11:07,447 --> 01:11:09,958
Sorry I'm late, I had a hell
of a time parking. 

661
01:11:09,982 --> 01:11:12,131
Oh thats okay, you're here, 
that's all that matters

662
01:11:12,155 --> 01:11:13,610
You're kidding me, I wouldn't miss
this for the world. 

663
01:11:13,634 --> 01:11:15,898
I saved you a seat next to Kate's parents okay?

664
01:11:15,922 --> 01:11:17,415
- I'll sit where you want Miss Steele. 
- Okay. I'll see you after. 

665
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:19,161
Yeah, good luck out there. 

666
01:11:19,385 --> 01:11:22,442
And is also a major benefactor
for our university. 

667
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:26,517
Please join me in welcoming, Mr Christian Grey.

668
01:11:41,726 --> 01:11:46,935
Thank you. I am deeply moved by the great 
compliment accorded to me today. 

669
01:11:47,702 --> 01:11:51,969
- He is so hot. 
- Oh god. He so is.

670
01:11:55,203 --> 01:11:56,441
I heard he's gay. 

671
01:11:56,476 --> 01:11:59,117
<i>Sustainable methods of farming
for third world countries.</i>

672
01:11:59,717 --> 01:12:05,248
The goal? To eradicate hunger and poverty
across the globe. 

673
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:14,078
I myself have known what its
like to be profoundly hungry. 

674
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:16,764
So this is a very personal mission for me.

675
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,309
Anastasia Steele.

676
01:12:30,293 --> 01:12:31,293
Thanks. 

677
01:12:35,086 --> 01:12:37,493
Congratulations, you must be very proud. 

678
01:12:37,517 --> 01:12:42,119
- I am. Nice tie by the way?
- Truthfully its become my favourite. 

679
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:45,845
- Do you have your answer yet?
- I'm still thinking. 

680
01:12:45,869 --> 01:12:48,767
Anastasia, just try it my way. Please. 

681
01:12:49,695 --> 01:12:51,618
- Okay.
- What?

682
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:57,221
- Congratulations
- Thank you. 

683
01:12:58,529 --> 01:13:00,316
(chatter)

684
01:13:01,676 --> 01:13:04,327
- Dad hi!
- I am so proud of you Annie.

685
01:13:04,351 --> 01:13:05,383
Thank you. 

686
01:13:05,407 --> 01:13:08,583
Oh, Kate. Best speech of all others. 
687
01:13:08,741 --> 01:13:09,781
- Thanks.
- Of course. 

688
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:10,941
Yeah, I agree. 

689
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:13,005
- Ana? Hi.
- Hi. 

690
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:16,082
Ray, have you met Christian Grey?
Ana's new boyfriend?

691
01:13:16,117 --> 01:13:17,117
Hi. 

692
01:13:17,608 --> 01:13:18,787
Great pleasure to meet you. 

693
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,301
My pleasure. I really enjoyed your speech. 

694
01:13:20,325 --> 01:13:23,266
- Thank you sir. 
- Sounds like you've accomplished some pretty impressive things. 

695
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:24,179
And what things?

696
01:13:24,203 --> 01:13:27,186
- Thank you. - Okay, I'm gonna go find
my family, who are

697
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:29,031
impatiently waiting to embarrass me. Bye. 

698
01:13:29,055 --> 01:13:32,037
- Visit us soon yeah?
- Soon as I get an invitation. 

699
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,422
So, how long you two known each other?

700
01:13:36,034 --> 01:13:38,474
A few weeks now, we actually met when
Anastasia

701
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:40,645
interviewed me for the student newspaper. 

702
01:13:40,669 --> 01:13:42,950
- A picture please Mr. Grey?
- One minute excuse me. 

703
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,445
Big smile now. 

704
01:13:57,281 --> 01:14:01,479
To celebrate your graduation.
Among other things

705
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:08,390
Roll your eyes at me again and 
I will take you across my knee. 

706
01:14:14,213 --> 01:14:15,464
So it begins.

707
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:22,325
- Come on, I've got something to show you.
- What?

708
01:14:31,363 --> 01:14:35,734
Thats cute. Doesn't really seem like your style though. 

709
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:42,202
Its not, happy graduation Anastasia. 

710
01:14:42,885 --> 01:14:46,255
Oh my god. Christian thats a car. 

711
01:14:47,089 --> 01:14:48,309
You don't miss much do you?

712
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:53,523
Thank you but I can't. This is too...

713
01:14:53,747 --> 01:14:56,544
- Do you like it?
- Of course I like it, its beautiful. 

714
01:14:58,341 --> 01:15:03,120
But I have a car...
Where's my car?

715
01:15:03,144 --> 01:15:05,299
I told Taylor to fetch a decent price for it. 

716
01:15:05,323 --> 01:15:07,267
Christian, this is way too much. 

717
01:15:07,291 --> 01:15:08,857
Did you just roll your eyes at me?

718
01:15:17,299 --> 01:15:20,292
- Do you know why I'm doing this?
- Because I rolled my eyes at you. 

719
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:21,859
And is that polite?

720
01:15:23,405 --> 01:15:24,405
No.

721
01:15:24,514 --> 01:15:27,192
- Excuse me?
- No, sir. 

722
01:15:46,224 --> 01:15:49,004
- Do you want more?
- Yes. Yes.

723
01:15:56,402 --> 01:15:58,043
Welcome to my world. 

724
01:16:19,956 --> 01:16:23,394
- What are you doing?
- There a few things at the office

725
01:16:23,418 --> 01:16:25,745
which require my attention. 

726
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,345
You okay?

727
01:16:30,811 --> 01:16:33,610
- I just thought that...
- I enjoyed tonight. 

728
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,420
I'll see you at my place tomorrow. 

729
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:09,505
Hi mama. 

730
01:17:09,529 --> 01:17:13,714
<i>¿Anastasia, whats going on, 
I've left you two messages this week.</i>

731
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:19,076
I know I'm sorry. I just got a little distracted. 

732
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:22,454
<i>I'm sorry I missed your graduation honey
I heard it was lovely.</i>

733
01:17:22,885 --> 01:17:24,313
And your new beau

734
01:17:24,832 --> 01:17:27,995
Ray told me all about him, he
sounds such a young man.

735
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:32,029
<i>Of course, I would've preferred to 
have heard about it from you. </i>

736
01:17:36,195 --> 01:17:37,282
Ana?

737
01:17:38,623 --> 01:17:39,698
<i>Whats the matter?</i>

738
01:17:41,509 --> 01:17:42,696
Nothing I'm fine. 

739
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:45,163
Is he not making you happy?

740
01:17:46,509 --> 01:17:49,425
He is yeah, I mean most of the time yeah.  

741
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:51,892
<i>Its complicated.</i>

742
01:17:54,443 --> 01:17:57,597
Listen honey, if you need a break, 
you just

743
01:17:57,717 --> 01:18:00,328
come on right down here. 

744
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:02,149
<i>Even if its just for a day or two.</i>

745
01:18:02,173 --> 01:18:05,017
<i>I have air miles, and we could talk
and have girl time.</i>

746
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:12,417
- Promise me you'll think about it?
- Yeah I promise. I promise. 

747
01:18:13,842 --> 01:18:16,997
- I love you mama. 
- I love you too darling. 

748
01:18:18,183 --> 01:18:21,515
I gotta go. Bye. 

749
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:32,145
<i>Looks like you and Grey did some celebration last night.</i>

750
01:18:33,506 --> 01:18:37,582
- Is he still asleep?
- No, he couldn't tay. 

751
01:18:38,306 --> 01:18:39,986
Well whose car keys are those then?

752
01:18:43,308 --> 01:18:46,984
- Those are my keys.
- Wow Ana.

753
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,100
What?

754
01:18:50,124 --> 01:18:51,761
Nothing, I'm just...

755
01:18:52,425 --> 01:18:54,888
Make sure you're taking it at your own pace okay?

756
01:18:54,912 --> 01:18:57,329
I am, I am, I gotta go. 

757
01:18:57,353 --> 01:18:58,699
Where are you going?

758
01:19:06,596 --> 01:19:11,395
- Look at this. 
- I've seen it, not a bad picture. 

759
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:13,991
Christian Grey and friend. 

760
01:19:15,472 --> 01:19:19,198
- So we're friends. 
- Well it must be true, if its in the paper.
761
01:19:20,828 --> 01:19:23,663
- So how did it go with Dr. Greene?
- It was fine. 

762
01:19:23,787 --> 01:19:25,858
But she said I had to abstain from

763
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:28,248
all sexual activity for four weeks. 

764
01:19:28,272 --> 01:19:30,032
You know, after I start the pill. 

765
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:31,043
What?

766
01:19:34,196 --> 01:19:35,196
Just kidding. 

767
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,451
I wanna take you to my playroom. 

768
01:19:54,431 --> 01:20:00,998
- I haven't signed the contract. 
- I'm well aware. Call it a free sample. 

769
01:20:02,286 --> 01:20:03,381
Okay. 

770
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:10,500
Ready?

771
01:20:45,259 --> 01:20:50,223
Eyes down. Take off your shoes. 

772
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:55,868
Arms above your head.

773
01:21:01,844 --> 01:21:04,437
You have a beautiful body Anastasia. 

774
01:21:04,563 --> 01:21:06,958
I want you unashamed of your nakedness, understand?

775
01:21:08,887 --> 01:21:09,887
Yes sir. 

776
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:15,407
Stop biting your lip, you know what it does
to me. Turn around. 

777
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:27,557
When I tell you to come into this room
This is how you'll be

778
01:21:29,508 --> 01:21:30,708
You'll wait for me. 

779
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:33,744
Kneeling by the door. 

780
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:41,373
Hands flat on your thighs. Good.

781
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:15,095
Hold out your hands.

782
01:22:41,934 --> 01:22:45,137
- Did that hurt?
- No.

783
01:22:45,425 --> 01:22:48,566
You see? Much of your fear is in your head.

784
01:22:50,253 --> 01:22:51,383
Come. 

785
01:24:27,735 --> 01:24:31,142
- How does that feel?
- Good. 

786
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,405
Quiet.

787
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,255
Where are we going?

788
01:26:17,308 --> 01:26:19,118
Remember my mother mentioned dinner?

789
01:26:19,913 --> 01:26:21,292
My sister Mia's in town. 

790
01:26:22,089 --> 01:26:23,089
Yes. 

791
01:26:26,653 --> 01:26:30,239
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah. 

792
01:26:31,793 --> 01:26:32,852
Dance with me. 

793
01:27:20,799 --> 01:27:22,442
- Good evening Mr. Grey. 

794
01:27:22,477 --> 01:27:23,477
They're here!

795
01:27:23,862 --> 01:27:24,862
You're here. 

796
01:27:25,029 --> 01:27:27,985
- Welcome welcome. 
- Ana, you've met my mother. 

797
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:28,939
Hi, lovely to see you.

798
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:31,150
This is my father, Carrick.
Hi, its nice to meet you.

799
01:27:31,185 --> 01:27:32,136
Pleasure to meet you. 

800
01:27:32,171 --> 01:27:32,701
<i>Is she here?</i>

801
01:27:32,736 --> 01:27:34,300
There's been a lot of speculation!

802
01:27:34,367 --> 01:27:36,433
Oh my god! She exists!

803
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:40,497
Its a great apartment, and the rent's not ridiculous

804
01:27:40,885 --> 01:27:42,719
Elliot and Jose helped us move in.

805
01:27:43,601 --> 01:27:47,708
Jose is Ana's friend, although I think Elliot's
trying to poach me.

806
01:27:47,743 --> 01:27:51,130
He's a cool guy!

807
01:27:52,132 --> 01:27:54,305
Ana, where is your family from?

808
01:27:54,613 --> 01:27:57,903
My step father's in Montesano and
my mom lives in Georgia
809
01:27:57,967 --> 01:28:00,314
- Georgia? Which part?
- Savannah.

810
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:05,487
How nice! Although I hear it gets really humid in Georgia
this time of year. 

811
01:28:05,671 --> 01:28:08,995
Oh my god it does. Its stifling sometimes. 

812
01:28:09,001 --> 01:28:10,927
Actually I'm going to visit her tomorrow. 

813
01:28:11,101 --> 01:28:14,439
How nice. You hear that Christian?

814
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:17,624
Some children do visit their parents now and again.

815
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:23,123
- Hey dad you catch the Mariners game?
- I heard it went back stream.

816
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:24,447
<i>¡Béisbol de Seattle!</i>

817
01:28:25,822 --> 01:28:27,598
This is news to me. When were you gonna tell me?

818
01:28:27,633 --> 01:28:29,754
<i>I think it was alright though.</i>

819
01:28:30,813 --> 01:28:32,097
Who wants coffee?

820
01:28:32,418 --> 01:28:35,398
Actually I promised Ana a tour of the grounds.

821
01:28:36,105 --> 01:28:37,181
Excuse us.

822
01:28:42,111 --> 01:28:45,288
Christian, I cannot walk that fast in these shoes. 
823
01:28:49,305 --> 01:28:50,747
When were you gonna tell me about Georgia?

824
01:28:50,971 --> 01:28:53,608
What? You have no right to be mad at me. 

825
01:28:53,632 --> 01:28:55,822
Yeah but I am mad. Palm-twitchingly mad. 

826
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:03,422
You're mine. All mine. Understand?

827
01:29:10,858 --> 01:29:12,842
Christian, you're so confusing.

828
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:18,856
- Ana.
- What do you want?

829
01:29:20,774 --> 01:29:23,060
- What do you want?
- I want you. 

830
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:25,620
I'm trying, Christian.

831
01:29:30,905 --> 01:29:32,078
I know you are.

832
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:35,175
Why can't we sleep in the same bed?

833
01:29:36,114 --> 01:29:40,517
Why won't you let me touch you?
Why does it have to be like this?

834
01:29:48,170 --> 01:29:49,938
If you would just sign the contract you wouldn't have...

835
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:52,120
Why do you care so much about the contract Christian?

836
01:29:52,144 --> 01:29:56,114
- Don't you like me the way I am?
- Of course I do. 

837
01:29:56,138 --> 01:29:59,861
- Then why are you trying to change me?
- I'm not. 

838
01:30:01,477 --> 01:30:05,031
- Its you
- I need more, I want more

839
01:30:06,746 --> 01:30:10,741
Hearts and flowers?
That's not something I know

840
01:30:12,932 --> 01:30:18,551
Ana please - its you that is changing me

841
01:30:20,675 --> 01:30:24,461
Let me touch you. Let me. 

842
01:30:38,928 --> 01:30:43,501
- Are they burns?
- I had a rough start in life.

843
01:30:43,925 --> 01:30:48,821
- That's all you need to know
- Okay.

844
01:31:11,888 --> 01:31:16,639
The woman who gave birth to me,
was a crack addict.

845
01:31:17,891 --> 01:31:19,153
And a prostitute. 

846
01:31:24,189 --> 01:31:25,983
She died when I was four.

847
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:36,617
I remember certain things. Terrible things.

848
01:31:40,884 --> 01:31:42,423
I don't remember her. 

849
01:31:46,485 --> 01:31:52,200
Sometimes, I can see her in my dreams. 

850
01:32:12,217 --> 01:32:13,957
Do you really have to go to Georgia?

851
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:20,099
Yeah, I really

852
01:32:43,115 --> 01:32:45,898
- This gazpacho is really salty Bob
- Yeah. 

853
01:32:45,922 --> 01:32:48,518
You'll get fat with all this sitting around
You tell him Ana.

854
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:51,581
- I'm not gonna tell him that.
- Yes thank you Ana.

855
01:32:51,605 --> 01:32:55,387
I'm just saying gazpacho is in a bowl of salsa

856
01:32:55,411 --> 01:32:58,163
Now could you hand me some chips for my bowl of salsa?

857
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,614
You can have a carrot?

858
01:33:00,876 --> 01:33:07,268
What are you getting at with this? You're lucky that I happen
to love you - very much. 

859
01:33:07,292 --> 01:33:09,236
- I know that. 
- Do you?

860
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,313
Hmm, I do

861
01:33:42,687 --> 01:33:47,834
<i>TE ECHO DE MENOS.
ME GUSTARÍA QUE ESTUVIERAS AQUÍ.</i>

862
01:33:47,858 --> 01:33:53,796
<i>YO TAMBIÉN. VOY A CENAR
CON UNA AMIGA ESTA NOCHE.</i>

863
01:33:59,388 --> 01:34:05,992
<i>¿QUÉ AMIGA? ¿LA SRA. ROBINSON?</i>

864
01:34:06,016 --> 01:34:09,800
<i>NO TE PREOCUPES POR ESO.</i>

865
01:34:47,406 --> 01:34:50,551
Oh darling, I think we should pace ourselves,
or at least order something to eat. 

866
01:34:50,575 --> 01:34:55,149
- You go ahead, I'm not very hungry. 
- Well, at least the fruit's nice. 

867
01:35:00,527 --> 01:35:04,085
- He can wait.
- Mom

868
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:07,059
<i>ANOTHER COSMO?</i>

869
01:35:07,483 --> 01:35:09,063
- Holy fuck
- What?

870
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:10,614
What is it?

871
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:15,550
Its Christian, he's here, in Georgia.

872
01:35:18,146 --> 01:35:20,763
- Here, here!
- Mrs Adams

873
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,095
Delighted to meet you. 

874
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:24,728
- Something to drink sir?
- Gin and tonic.

875
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:27,293
Hendrix if you have it, otherwise Bombay Sapphire


876
01:35:27,317 --> 01:35:29,841
Cucumber with the Hendricks,
lime with Bombay

877
01:35:29,865 --> 01:35:33,310
- I like him already
- What are you doing here Christian?

878
01:35:33,434 --> 01:35:36,678
- I came to see you. 
- I need to go to the bathroom

879
01:35:47,443 --> 01:35:49,982
I broke rule 7, clause 5

880
01:35:52,183 --> 01:35:57,342
We'll let it go, lets not talk
about the contract right now

881
01:35:57,944 --> 01:35:59,405
How was your dinner?

882
01:36:03,183 --> 01:36:05,887
She's a friend, thats all

883
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:07,908
She knows me.

884
01:36:08,977 --> 01:36:13,707
- What did she advise you to do?
-Well I'm here

885
01:36:16,347 --> 01:36:19,996
- Now what?
- I've got a room in this hotel.

886
01:36:22,017 --> 01:36:23,776
Well I hope you'll be comfortable in it

887
01:36:28,401 --> 01:36:30,202
What are you doing for breakfast tomorrow?

888
01:36:35,877 --> 01:36:38,875
- Where are we going?
- Its a surprise.

889
01:36:39,468 --> 01:36:42,111
I think I've reached my quota of surprises.

890
01:36:43,719 --> 01:36:44,968
We're almost there. 

891
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:55,551
Mr Grey? Hey, I'll be your co-pilot

892
01:36:55,575 --> 01:36:58,198
How do you do? This is my girlfriend,
Anastasia Steele.

893
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:32,143
<i>We're at 400 feet, ready?</i>

894
01:37:32,467 --> 01:37:35,490
- Ready?
- Yes, ready. 

895
01:37:35,714 --> 01:37:37,080
Release. 

896
01:38:06,596 --> 01:38:07,804
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

897
01:38:10,329 --> 01:38:13,682
- Is this more?
- Oh my god. So much more!

898
01:38:34,633 --> 01:38:39,147
Oh my god, that was incredible Christian.
Thank you.

899
01:38:39,271 --> 01:38:41,179
We aim to please Miss Steele.

900
01:38:42,193 --> 01:38:47,518
- I thought you didn't do romance.
- I don't. Ana.

901
01:38:47,542 --> 01:38:51,994
What? What?
Why are you fighting this?

902
01:38:55,196 --> 01:38:56,816
What are you afraid of?

903
01:39:07,321 --> 01:39:11,784
Grey. What? When?

904
01:39:14,025 --> 01:39:17,905
Have Stefan get the plane ready.
I'll be on the tarmac in 30 minutes.

905
01:39:18,329 --> 01:39:20,803
- What happened?
- I have to go back to Seattle.

906
01:39:21,327 --> 01:39:22,547
Come I'll take you home. 

907
01:39:24,999 --> 01:39:27,068
Oh sweetheart, I wish Christian could've stayed

908
01:39:27,103 --> 01:39:29,795
Bob was looking forward to meeting him. 

909
01:39:29,819 --> 01:39:34,737
I know, he had to get back to Seattle though.
There's a um, situation at work. 

910
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:38,293
I wish I could tell you things get easier,
but they don't.

911
01:39:38,317 --> 01:39:41,311
You just need to get to know yourself better.

912
01:39:42,733 --> 01:39:45,515
- Thank you for everything mama
- Take care.

913
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:46,550
I will.

914
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:06,533
<i>STEELE</i>

915
01:40:06,568 --> 01:40:09,582
You think I wouldn't recognise you Taylor?

916
01:40:09,772 --> 01:40:11,094
Right this way Miss Steele. 

917
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:21,121
- How does he seem Taylor?
- Preoccupied I'm afraid. 

918
01:40:21,934 --> 01:40:24,401
- Really?
- Yes ma'am.

919
01:40:30,668 --> 01:40:32,085
Well that's not gonna work. 

920
01:40:34,421 --> 01:40:35,539
What?

921
01:40:37,555 --> 01:40:43,066
Well tell them they don't have 24 hours.
That is unnacceptable.

922
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:46,440
I need to know. Just keep me informed. 

923
01:41:02,747 --> 01:41:08,326
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing that concerns you. 

924
01:41:10,394 --> 01:41:12,788
- I can leave if you want me to go?
- No.

925
01:41:14,553 --> 01:41:16,235
Thats the last thing I want.

926
01:41:22,808 --> 01:41:27,060
I want you, in the playroom, in 15 minutes.

927
01:41:49,775 --> 01:41:53,486
- What are your safe words?
- Red and yellow.

928
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:55,006
Remember them. 

929
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:17,676
That sounds so sad. Everything you play
sounds sad. 

930
01:43:19,674 --> 01:43:24,079
When you were six and learning, was it
because you wanted to please your new family?

931
01:43:33,025 --> 01:43:34,591
I just wanna talk. 

932
01:43:38,790 --> 01:43:40,630
Why won't you let me in?

933
01:43:43,187 --> 01:43:45,748
- We should be talking.
- Like normal people?

934
01:43:46,131 --> 01:43:47,222
Yeah. 

935
01:43:50,893 --> 01:43:52,360
Is that so wrong?

936
01:44:04,884 --> 01:44:07,979
Is this because of the contract?
Because I still haven't signed it?

937
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:12,821
Fuck the contract, I think its a 
little redundant don't you?

938
01:44:14,269 --> 01:44:16,412
So then the rules are redundant too?

939
01:44:16,682 --> 01:44:20,357
- No. The rules stand. 
- And what if I break them?

940
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:23,221
- Then there'll be consequences.
- Punishment?

941
01:44:23,724 --> 01:44:24,724
Yes. 

942
01:44:26,125 --> 01:44:28,176
- Why do you want to punish me?
- Ana.

943
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,173
Why do you want to hurt me?

944
01:44:33,306 --> 01:44:36,111
I would never do anything to you,
that you couldn't handle.

945
01:44:36,146 --> 01:44:39,126
But why do you even wanna do anything
at all to me Christian?

946
01:44:41,147 --> 01:44:44,368
If I told you, you'd never look at me 
the same way again. 

947
01:44:45,324 --> 01:44:48,816
So there is a reason. Tell me.

948
01:44:51,084 --> 01:44:53,290
- Do you wanna punish me right now?
- Yes.

949
01:44:53,614 --> 01:44:55,643
I wanna punish you right now.

950
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:01,136
What if I told you that I feel the same 
way about being punished as you

951
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:03,762
do about me touching you, would
you still wanna punish me then?

952
01:45:06,417 --> 01:45:09,715
No. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't need to.

953
01:45:09,844 --> 01:45:11,767
- Why?
- Ana stop. 

954
01:45:11,791 --> 01:45:14,365
- Why do you need...
- Because its the way I am!

955
01:45:22,501 --> 01:45:24,640
Because I'm 50 shades of fucked up.

956
01:45:47,891 --> 01:45:49,241
Show me then.

957
01:46:03,358 --> 01:46:08,361
I need you to show me, what
you wanna do to me.

958
01:46:09,012 --> 01:46:11,536
Punish me, show me how bad it can be.

959
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:13,392
I want you to show me the worst. 

960
01:46:21,464 --> 01:46:23,317
Its the only way I can understand.

961
01:46:37,419 --> 01:46:40,628
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

962
01:46:53,602 --> 01:46:54,775
Bend over. 

963
01:47:02,156 --> 01:47:06,025
I'm gonna hit you six times.
And you're gonna count with me.

964
01:47:18,495 --> 01:47:22,823
- Count, Anastasia.
- One

965
01:47:28,695 --> 01:47:29,921
Two

966
01:47:38,611 --> 01:47:39,611
Three

967
01:47:50,472 --> 01:47:51,765
Four

968
01:47:59,331 --> 01:48:00,543
Five.

969
01:48:14,412 --> 01:48:15,570
Six. 

970
01:48:31,223 --> 01:48:35,098
Is this what you really want?
You wanna see me like this?

971
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,418
- Ana.
- Don't come near me.

972
01:48:46,454 --> 01:48:48,102
Does this give you pleasure?

973
01:48:51,399 --> 01:48:52,399
No.

974
01:48:57,649 --> 01:48:59,525
Don't you dare come near me.

975
01:50:03,593 --> 01:50:05,061
Please don't hate me.

976
01:50:08,246 --> 01:50:10,349
You will never do that to me again.

977
01:50:19,244 --> 01:50:24,324
- I'm not what you want.
- No, you are everything that I want. 

978
01:50:33,138 --> 01:50:34,943
I've fallen in love with you. 

979
01:50:38,973 --> 01:50:42,767
No. No, Ana. You can't love me. 

980
01:50:56,183 --> 01:50:57,713
I need you to leave.

981
01:51:04,571 --> 01:51:05,782
Please. 

982
01:52:00,019 --> 01:52:05,087
- I'd like my car back.
- Taylor already sold it.

983
01:52:07,468 --> 01:52:09,662
Then I'd like the money he got for it please.

984
01:52:11,354 --> 01:52:12,708
I'll send you a check.

985
01:52:13,615 --> 01:52:14,615
Okay. 

986
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,141
Taylor will take you home. 

987
01:52:40,038 --> 01:52:41,038
Stop.

988
01:52:41,727 --> 01:52:42,735
No!

989
01:52:58,132 --> 01:53:00,281
- Ana.
- Christian.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
