2
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,680
not much going on for a Friday.

3
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,140
It's early yet.

4
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,020
Make it a double would you.

5
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,280
Sure.

6
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,376
And buy one for yourself.
I gotta make a call.

7
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,480
Thank's pal.

8
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,120
Therese?
Is that you?

9
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
What do you know!

10
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,690
I'm saying to myself,
I know that girl.

11
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,190
Jack.

12
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,760
It's great to see you, therese.

13
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,860
It's been, months.

14
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,600
Months.

15
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,300
Jack, this is Carol arid.

16
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,720
Pleased to meet you.

17
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,400
Likewise.

18
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,320
Hey, Ted gray's meeting me here

19
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,160
Phil and a bunch of us
are going down to Phil's party.

20
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,176
You're going aren't you?

21
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,720
Yes. I just planned to
get there a little...

22
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,856
You two go ahead.

23
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,216
You coming along?

24
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,120
No,

25
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,080
I should make a few calls before dinner,
anyway.

26
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,650
I should really run.

27
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,950
You sure?

28
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,950
Of course.

29
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,296
Then it would be great to catch a ride.

30
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,120
Yeah, sure.

31
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,500
You two have a wonderful night.

32
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,906
Nice meeting you, Jack.

33
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,800
Nice meeting you.

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,540
Alright, well let me go make
sure the loaf is on his way.

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,280
Back in a flash.

36
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,270
I like your scribbles.

37
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,780
Yeah, I've been busy!

38
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,380
I don't know how you do it.

39
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
What?

40
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,400
You look a million bucks
first thing in the morning.

41
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
I'll be down in a minute.

42
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,280
So, I got the schedules.
In the mail.

43
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,320
You listening to me?

44
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,320
I'm listening!
You got the schedules.

45
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,400
Two sailings to France in June,
one in July.

46
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,000
Wow.

47
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,000
What do think?

48
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,640
I think...

49
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,536
It's too cold I can't think straight.

50
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Alright let's get you warmed up.

51
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,416
Compliments in the
season from the management.

52
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,416
Compliments of the
season from the management.

53
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,240
Season's greetings
from the management.

54
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,776
Esther anyway she's just

55
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,280
going crazy with no girls
in the family but Esther-

56
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,240
how is Esther?

57
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,216
She'll pull through.

58
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,216
Compliments of the
season from the management.

59
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,640
Compliments of the
season from the management.

60
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,920
I gotta open the floor.

61
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,560
See you later

62
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,880
miss blivet.
You're needed upstairs

63
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,120
make it snappy.

64
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,316
Frankenberg good morning,
happy

65
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,400
holidays and welcome,
shoppers, to frankenberg's.

66
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,066
Be sure to take advantage of our

67
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,916
congratulations ike and mamie
inaugural early bird special

68
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,480
ike mamie in our beds and bedding
department on the second floor.

69
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,376
And on your way there, you won't
want to miss our brand new general

70
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,886
electric television and
stereophonic display on

71
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:04,240
the first floor, just
past the haberdashery.

72
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,080
Miss, miss,
where's the ladies room, honey?

73
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,620
If you go back to the
elevator, make a right, you can't miss it.

74
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,600
Thanks you

75
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,520
I wonder if you might
help me find this doll for my daughter.

76
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,480
Bright Betsy bright Betsy.
Oh she cries. And wets herself.

77
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,810
But I'm afraid
we're out of stock.

78
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,980
I've left it too long.

79
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,456
We have plenty
of other dolls. All kinds, hmm…

80
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,360
right. What was
your favorite doll when you were four?

81
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,630
Me? I never...
Not many, to be honest.

82
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,240
Sorry. No
smoking on the sales floor.

83
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,976
Oh, of all the -
forgive me. Shopping makes me nervous.

84
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
That's okay.
Working here makes me nervous.

85
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,480
You're very kind.

86
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,040
Here she is.

87
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,840
She looks like you.
Around the eyes.

88
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,840
You think so?

89
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,490
So what did you
want when you were this age?

90
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,460
A train set.

91
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,930
Really? Do you
know much about train sets?

92
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,550
I do actually. And
there's a new model, just in last week.

93
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,196
Hand-built and hand-painted

94
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,976
cars, it's a limited
edition of five thousand,

95
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,880
you may have seen it.
Over by the elevators.

96
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,546
I would show you more of

97
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,100
it, but... I'm sort of confined.
To this desk.

98
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,360
Do you ship?

99
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,750
Special delivery. Or
courier. You'll have it in two, three days.

100
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
We'll even
assemble it for you.

101
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,780
Well. That's...
That. Sold.

102
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,996
Shall I pay now?

103
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,560
Oh yes, of course.

104
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,500
I need your account
details. And your shipping address.

105
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,160
Of course.

106
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,960
I love Christmas.

107
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,381
Wrapping gifts, all that. And then

108
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:19,250
you somehow wind up overcooking
the turkey anyway.

109
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,790
Done.

110
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,480
Where'd you learn so much about train sets?

111
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,080
I... read.
Too much, probably.

112
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,400
It's refreshing.

113
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,480
Thank you

114
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,640
merry Christmas.

115
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,600
Merry Christmas.

116
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,210
I like your hat.

117
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,430
Move over. Nobody
else can see the screen.

118
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,300
Nobody else is watching.

119
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm watching.

120
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,670
I've seen it six times.

121
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,731
Right now I'm charting the correlation

122
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:49,910
between what the characters
say and how they really feel.

123
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,440
My kid brother,
the movie jerk.

124
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,560
I'm strictly a beer man.
Everything else makes me want to vomit.

125
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,636
Wine makes me feel naughty
but in a good way.

126
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,800
I drink to forget I gotta get up
for work in the morning.

127
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,336
Semco see, that's your problem,
semco.

128
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,560
You really ought to
drink because you remember you have a job.

129
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,240
Employment is a curse.

130
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,936
Phil you have a job, Phil.

131
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,176
You call that a job?
I call it an illusion.

132
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,960
You get paid.
Is money an illusion?

133
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,960
My kid brother,
the jerk philosopher.

134
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
Where do you work?

135
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,856
Dannie works at the New York times.

136
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,816
No kidding.

137
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,720
It's a job.

138
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,576
But I want to write.
That's why I watch movies.

139
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Everybody's a writer...

140
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,840
Therese say, therese-before
I get too drunk to remember...

141
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,816
You did it? It's fixed?

142
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,816
He said it was a cinch.
No sweat.

143
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,840
Thank you, Phil!
I was missing it!

144
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,256
So, you take pictures?

145
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,056
Well.

146
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,936
She's more excited by some chintzy

147
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,816
camera than she is about
sailing with me to Europe.

148
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,600
Women.

149
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,480
You said it, pal!

150
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,516
I don't believe it!
Does the house un-American

151
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,336
activities know you're back on the streets?
Hey honey, hey darling.

152
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,216
Terry, honey,
it's been ages. Call me, would you?

153
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,760
I will, I promise!

154
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,496
You still owe me for that poker game!

155
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,120
Richard, watch out, you're!

156
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,456
You come by the times,
for dinner sometime?

157
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,376
I work at night, so... I've

158
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,320
got a good pal who's a
junior photo editor.

159
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,480
He loves to pontificate.
I'll introduce you.

160
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,270
Really? I would like that.

161
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,280
Yeah? Okay.

162
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,196
Sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six…. Sixty?

163
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Fifty-four.

164
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,160
That must be your daddy.
Come on. We'd better finish up.

165
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,536
Mommy can you come skating too

166
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,216
oh, I wish I could, sweet pea.

167
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,800
Why plea please?

168
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,800
Hiya, sunshine.

169
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,416
Daddy! I want mommy to come.

170
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,840
You do don't you?

171
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,520
You're early.

172
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,880
Mail came.

173
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,240
Cy Harrison's wife.
Jeanette

174
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,200
Jeanette asked about you.

175
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,680
Did she?

176
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
You can color the trunk honey.

177
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,240
I know she'd love to see you there.

178
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,720
Give her my best.
I've always liked Jeanette.

179
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,160
I'd like you to be there.

180
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm sorry, harge.
I have plans.

181
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,840
Mommy wants to give
aunt Abby a present

182
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,776
you been seeing a lot of

183
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,240
aunt Abby lately, haven't you sunshine?
With mommy?
Yes

184
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I'll try and re-arrange with Abby.

185
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,080
Thank you.

186
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,436
I told this

187
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,856
customer it would get to
her by Christmas Eve.

188
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,096
According to what we've been told.
Three days should be...

189
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Should have been
delivered this afternoon.

190
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,048
Oh. Right. So... it arrived?
She signed for it?

191
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,680
It arrived.

192
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,920
Great. Thank you. Thanks.

193
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,856
Belivet? Miss belivet?

194
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,856
Over here please. Now?

195
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,476
Sorry, would you excuse me. I...
Just be one minute.

196
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,230
Of course.

197
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,616
Hello?

198
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,896
Is this employee 645-a,
Theresa belivet?

199
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,376
Yes.

200
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
We're patching you though

201
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,460
so it was you.

202
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,600
Oh hello. Mrs. arid?
Did you receive the train set alright?

203
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,280
I did. Yes.

204
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,076
And the gloves. Thank

205
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,080
you so much. You're a
star for sending them.

206
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,256
I just wanna to say thank you.
Really.

207
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,240
Of course.

208
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,600
What... what I wanna to say was

209
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,416
do you get lunch hour there?

210
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,616
Let me take you to lunch.
It's the least I can do.

211
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,880
Yes, of course.
But you don't have to...

212
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm free tomorrow.

213
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,360
Tomorrow?

214
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,800
No, I don't know it.
Hold on.

215
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
Can I borrow a pencil and paper?

216
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,810
Thank you.

217
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,410
All right

218
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,900
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

219
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,760
I'll have the creamed spinach
over poached eggs.

220
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,480
And a dry Martini.
With an olive.

221
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,180
I'll have the same.

222
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,600
The meal or the drink?

223
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,920
All of it. Thank you.

224
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,390
Cigarette?

225
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,990
Yes please.

226
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,880
So what kind of a name is belivet?

227
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,816
T's Czech. It's changed.
Originally...

228
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,080
It's very original.

229
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,840
Well

230
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,296
and your first name?

231
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,040
Therese

232
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
therese, not ter-eeza

233
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,360
no.

234
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,800
Therese belivet.

235
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,830
It's lovely.

236
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,230
And yours?

237
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,960
Carol.

238
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,160
Carol.

239
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,496
Two dry Martinis.

240
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you.

241
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,670
Cheers.
Cheers.

242
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,881
So
You… I'm sure you thought

243
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,290
it was a man who sent
back your gloves.

244
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,760
I did.

245
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,020
I thought it might
be a man in the ski department.

246
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,060
I'm sorry.

247
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,086
No,
I'm delighted. I doubt

248
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,100
very much if I'd have
gone to lunch with him.

249
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,240
Your perfume.

250
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,120
Yes?

251
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,440
It's nice.

252
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,520
Thank you.

253
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,256
Harge thank you.
Harge bought

254
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,496
me a bottle years ago,
before we were married.

255
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,960
I've been
wearing it ever since.

256
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,840
Harge is your husband?

257
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,120
Yes. Well. Technically we...
We're divorcing.

258
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,256
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,240
Don't be.

260
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,230
And do you live alone, therese belivet?

261
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,360
I do.

262
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,860
Well there's Richard.
He wants to live with me.

263
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,400
No, it's nothing like that.
It's... he'd like to marry me.

264
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,136
I see.

265
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,920
Would you like to marry him?

266
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,040
I barely even know what to order for lunch.

267
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,480
And your meals.

268
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,240
Thank you.

269
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,280
Enjoy.

270
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,960
I'm starved.
Bon appetite.

271
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,370
What do you do on Sundays?

272
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,960
Nothing in particular.
What do you do?

273
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,320
Nothing... lately.

274
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,760
I mean, if you'd like to visit
me some time, you're welcome to.

275
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,800
At least there's some
pretty country around where I live.

276
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,120
Would you like to come out this Sunday?

277
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,560
Yes.

278
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,960
What a
strange girl you are.

279
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,160
Why?

280
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,040
Flung out of space.

281
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,340
Just see harge's
mother's face when she sees me in this.

282
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,896
Maybe I should stop home and change.

283
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,480
Don't be a stupe.

284
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,920
Maybe I should just not show up?

285
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,096
Well than I'll be blamed

286
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,840
for it. So you'd better
just grin and bear it.

287
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,400
You want to tell me about her?

288
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
Therese?

289
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,120
She returned my gloves.

290
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,640
And?

291
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,216
And if you don't get us
out of this traffic soon,

292
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,840
I won't have to worry
about that damned party.

293
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,200
Where... is my compact.
God damn it.

294
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,800
You look fine.

295
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,976
Come in with me.
Just for a minute.

296
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,216
Don't even start.

297
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,000
- You're the one who canceled on us
- you nitwit!

298
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,240
I know. I'm sorry. I'm going!

299
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,880
Call me later.

300
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,080
You're always the
most beautiful woman in any room.

301
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,250
Tell your mother that.

302
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,676
Keep an eye out, will

303
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,360
you? Cy will scream if
he catches me with this.

304
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,530
What will he do?
Dock your allowance?

305
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,040
He doesn't like me to smoke.

306
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,840
So? You like it.

307
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,360
Carol, I... it's really not my business

308
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,656
but if you're going to
be alone on Christmas

309
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
cy and I would love to have you.

310
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,600
Thank you, Jeanette.

311
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,400
I don't know.

312
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I don't know.
I might get away by myself.

313
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,360
At least for a few days.

314
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,120
Don't worry.
Nothing will break if you pick it up.

315
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,530
What are your pictures like?

316
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,880
I don't know.
They're probably not very good.

317
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,940
I mean... what are they?
What do you take pictures of?

318
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,910
Trees. Birds. Windows. Anything, really.

319
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,200
What do you write about?

320
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,760
People.

321
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,576
Always feel funny taking
pictures of people.

322
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Like it's some sort of a ..

323
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,080
Invasion of privacy?

324
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,400
Yes.

325
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,720
All of us, you know,
we have affinities for people.

326
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,320
We like certain people.
You like certain people right?

327
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,376
Sometimes.

328
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
You don't like others.

329
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,421
And you don't know why

330
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:57,826
you're attracted to some
people and not others,

331
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,481
the only thing you know is... you

332
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:03,160
either are attracted or
you're not attracted.

333
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,970
It's like physics bouncing
off each other like pin balls.

334
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,831
Yeah but... not everything's

335
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:15,070
as simple as a bunch of
pin balls reacting or,

336
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,180
some things don't
even react. But everything's alive.

337
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,080
It's late. I should go.

338
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,480
You shouldn't

339
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,000
why? Did you mind?

340
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,840
No.

341
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,120
I have to go.

342
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,040
Come back tomorrow? Or Wednesday?

343
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,040
Maybe. I don't know.

344
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,320
Here.

345
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,240
Thanks.

346
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,600
And thanks for staying sober
and driving me home.

347
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,920
Harge goodnight, harge.

348
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,280
Carol

349
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,160
come to my parents for Christmas.

350
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,120
We had a good time tonight.

351
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,320
It was one night harge.

352
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,640
I don't like the idea of you being alone.

353
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,880
I'm not alone. There's rindy. And a...

354
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,280
Abbey.

355
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,920
There's always Abby.

356
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,516
Harge Abby and I were

357
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,440
over long before you and
I were over, harge.

358
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,336
I'll have rindy packed

359
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,680
and ready for you at four on Christmas Eve.

360
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,760
It shouldn't be like this.

361
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,720
I know.

362
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,830
Mama's special girl.

363
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,670
Goodnight, Florence.

364
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,200
Where's this place in jersey?

365
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,360
The country. I don't really know.

366
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,536
My uncle sal lives in union city

367
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
and he claims it's pretty
dangerous at night

368
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,560
it's not union city.

369
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,600
Okay.

370
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,600
There's my ride.

371
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,920
Hi.

372
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,040
Hello. Carol arid.

373
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,336
Richard semco.
Glad to meet you.

374
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,280
Likewise.

375
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,520
Therese speaks very highly of you.

376
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,960
That's well.
So you'll get her back here safe and sound?

377
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,400
I think I see snow

378
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,360
wouldn't that be wonderful?

379
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,760
I love the snow

380
00:32:18,770 --> 00:31:37,586
makes you feel like Christmas,
don't you think?

381
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,920
Love you.

382
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,120
You still with me?

383
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,400
Yes

384
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,650
mommy's home!

385
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,330
Hello, my darling!
Guess what I brought you?

386
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,816
I bet you'll never guess...

387
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,320
Is it blue?

388
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,320
No, it's green.

389
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,680
Oh it's long isn't it.
Do you need scissors?

390
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,616
Maybe we should do the star first.

391
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,200
We can do that,
where's the star?

392
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,736
The gold or...

393
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,600
- You choose
- ok

394
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,640
that's my girl.

395
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,680
What do you think?

396
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,560
Good.

397
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,600
That is the most beautiful
tree in the whole wide world.

398
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,840
Were those pictures of me you were taking?
At the tree lot?

399
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,580
I'm sorry. I should have asked.

400
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,360
Don't apologize.

401
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,920
I've been trying to...

402
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,840
A friend of mine told me
I should be more interested. In humans.

403
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,840
And how's that going?

404
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,120
It's going well... actually.

405
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,600
I'm glad.

406
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,080
That's beautiful.

407
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,150
Is that what you want to be?

408
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
A photographer?

409
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,190
I think so. If I have any talent for it.

410
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,320
Isn't that something other people
let you know you have.

411
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,320
And all you can do is...

412
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,920
Keep working.

413
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,440
Use what feels right.
Throw away the rest.

414
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,040
I suppose so.

415
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,800
Will you show me your work?

416
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,376
Sure. I mean, I haven't sold anything.

417
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,656
Or even shown a picture
to anyone who could buy one.

418
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
I don't even have a decent camera.

419
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,890
But they're all at my place.
Under the sink, mostly.

420
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,880
Invite me round.

421
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,440
Harge harge.
What's wrong?

422
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,476
Nothing. Does there have

423
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,560
to be a problem for me
to visit my wife?

424
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,680
That's not fair, harge.

425
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,840
We agreed that rindy
would stay with me until Christmas Eve.

426
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,456
What do you suggest I do?

427
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,016
You think I prefer traipsing

428
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,600
off to west palm beach
for the holiday?

429
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,400
It was all mother's idea

430
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,576
but I'm not... ready...
She's not packed,

431
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,576
she's asleep upstairs in bed!

432
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,176
What about my Christmas with my daughter?

433
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,456
I'm sorry, Carol,
but it can't be helped.

434
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,280
The flight's in the morning
you think I've packed already?

435
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,400
Goddammit!

436
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,340
How do you know my wife?

437
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,340
Harge, please...

438
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,936
I... work at frankenberg's.
The department store.

439
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,816
I ordered a gift from her desk.
I forgot my gloves.

440
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
She returned them.
I thanked her...

441
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,240
That's bold.

442
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,680
Can I do anything?

443
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,800
Just... leave it be.

444
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,910
Okay, snow flake.
Gimme a big one.

445
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,000
You're going to have a wonderful Christmas,
I promise.

446
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,240
There's room for you in the car, mommy.
You can come with us!

447
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,960
Oh, darling…
I wish I could...

448
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
You know sometimes...

449
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,596
Mommies and daddies decide there isn't

450
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,840
enough room for them both
in the same place at the same time

451
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,036
anyway, mommy has to be here to make sure

452
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,360
Santa's elf doesn't give your gift
from mommy to another little girl.

453
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,240
You wouldn't want that, would you?

454
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,280
No.

455
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,160
I love you snowflake

456
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,400
you smell good.

457
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,280
You're drunk.

458
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,440
Harge, I'm very cold.

459
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,960
Let me get you some coffee.

460
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,040
I'm not drunk.

461
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,800
You can still come with us.
Go back a bag.

462
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,016
I can't do that.

463
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,080
Yes, you can.

464
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,416
What are you gonna do?

465
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,076
You're gonna stay here with Abby?

466
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,760
You're gonna stay
with the shop girl over there?

467
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,760
What are you gonna do?

468
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,616
Stop it. God damn it.

469
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
I put nothing past women like you. Carol.

470
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,640
You married a woman like me.

471
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,040
If you don't get in that car
with us right now?

472
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,200
Then what? Then it's over?

473
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,640
God damn you

474
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,200
you were never... cruel.

475
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,480
Harge.

476
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,680
I should call a cab.

477
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,046
And just when you think it

478
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,900
can't get any worse,
you run out of cigarettes.

479
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,416
Oh...
I... tell me where to go.

480
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,880
I'll buy some for you.
I don't mind really.

481
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,376
You don't have to run out in

482
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,640
- the middle of nowhere to buy cigarettes.
- I'm fine.

483
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,880
The next train's at 8.30.
I'll drive you to the station.

484
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,000
Hello?

485
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,656
Do you know what time it is, miss belivet?

486
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
- I'm sorry,
- it just rang...

487
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Hello?

488
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,840
I was... horrible. Earlier.

489
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,200
Will you forgive me?

490
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,160
Yes...

491
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,160
I mean

492
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,840
then will you... would you...
Let me... come see you tomorrow evening?

493
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,240
Alright, yes...

494
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,200
I want to... know.

495
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,960
I mean, I want to ask you... things.

496
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,240
But I'm not sure you want that.

497
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,680
Ask me. Things. Please.

498
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,856
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

499
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,216
Thank you Mrs. arid.

500
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,656
There he is.

501
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,096
Now will you talk to me?

502
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,096
I didn't want you to come
all the way down here

503
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,120
just... give it to me, straight, Fred.

504
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,160
What am I not to worry
about until after the holiday?

505
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,536
Jerry rix served some

506
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,720
papers this morning,
to my complete surprise.

507
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,360
Why don't you sit.

508
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,816
Why is it people think you're

509
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,600
going to take bad news better
if you're sitting down?

510
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,456
Rindy, harge took out an injunction

511
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,616
which denies you any access to
rindy until the custody hearing.

512
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,320
What?

513
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,716
Harge rindy
and I'm afraid harge has changed

514
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,880
his mind about joint custody.
He wants sole custody of rindy.

515
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,600
We've already
reached an agreement about custody.

516
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,920
What is this all about?

517
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,476
They'll be filing
the formal papers on the twenty-ninth

518
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,400
in district family court one. For
the, uh, permanent petition, that is.

519
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,936
Can he do this?
Is it... right?

520
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,600
I don't know if it's
right, but it's certainly legal.

521
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,360
On what grounds.

522
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,836
Listen.
Let's deal with

523
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,800
this after Christmas.
You'll have a chance to-

524
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,560
on. What. Grounds.

525
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,160
They're petitioning the
judge to consider a morality clause.

526
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,240
A morality... what
the hell does that mean?

527
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,120
Abby gerhard okay. I won't
mince words with you. Abby gerhard.

528
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,916
Also they're
suggesting similar associations

529
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,256
with, well they're alleging
evidence of a pattern of behave

530
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,840
evidence of a pattern?

531
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,000
Abbyrindy Abby... Abby is
rindy's godmother. Abby is...

532
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,560
Rindy... if he can't
have me, I can't have rindy. That's…

533
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,216
I'm sorry.
But they seem serious.

534
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,240
When's
the custody hearing?

535
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,736
That's hard to say, with
the holidays and a backlog of cases.

536
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,400
Fred your best guess, Fred.

537
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,560
Not before the middle
of march. Could be middle of April.

538
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,000
Can I see her?

539
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,376
Not - let me put it this way
it would not be advisable under the

540
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,376
at school?
In an office with a-

541
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,680
the
issue is not where

542
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,436
Carol
surely a visit supervised

543
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,080
by a teacher or a -Carol, these
are serious allegations.

544
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,200
Forcing
contact before the hearing

545
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,476
you
simply invite further

546
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,680
scrutiny concerning your conduct.
My conduct!

547
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,560
Jesus Christ.

548
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,560
I'm her mother
for god's sake.

549
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,680
A morality clause.

550
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,800
I see

551
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,320
do you?

552
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,320
No

553
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,000
Rindy there's nothing
moral about taking rindy from me.

554
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,620
Yes,
that's it thank you.

555
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,480
Find what you wanted?

556
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,640
Something for
someone at the store.

557
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,640
Oh that's nice of you.

558
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,320
You should stop
by on Christmas sometime.

559
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,920
My mom's sort
of planning on it.

560
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,040
…... Christmas... that's
for families. I'd feel.. I don't know...

561
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,040
Terry you
are family, Terry.

562
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,076
I'm
thinking of putting

563
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,960
together a portfolio, you
know, of my pictures.

564
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,560
Start taking portraits, even.
Apply for jobs.

565
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,216
Dannie...
Maybe at a newspaper.

566
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,416
Maybe at the times.
Dannie knows someone...

567
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,800
Have you been
thinking more about Europe?

568
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,600
Terry Terry?

569
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,200
What?

570
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,920
How many times
have you been in love?

571
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,080
Never.

572
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,080
Until you.

573
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,480
Don't lie. You told me about
those two other girls.

574
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,400
Come on. They were

575
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,720
I had sex with them.
That's not the same thing.

576
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,916
Meaning... I'm different

577
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,760
because you haven't...
Gone all the way with me?

578
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,840
No

579
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,120
Hey, what's this all about?

580
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,760
I love you. That's what's different.

581
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,480
Have you ever been in love with a boy?

582
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,800
No.

583
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,080
But you've heard of it?

584
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,256
Of course. I mean, have I heard of
people like that? Sure.

585
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,096
I don't mean people like that. I mean

586
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,936
two people who just...
Fall in love. With each other.

587
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Say, a boy and a boy.
Out of the blue.

588
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,960
I don't know anyone like that.

589
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,636
But I'll tell you this... there's

590
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,080
always some reason for it.
In the background.

591
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,360
So you don't think it
could happen to somebody,

592
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,360
just anybody?
No. I don't.

593
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,240
What are you saying?
Are you in love with a girl?

594
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,280
No

595
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,800
Don't you know
I want to spend my life with you?

596
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,336
Come to France with me.
Let's get married.

597
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,120
Richard, I'm not... ready. For that.
I can't make myself...

598
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,360
What? Tell me.

599
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,680
I'm sorry. I have to go.
I'm sorry.

600
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,280
I found rindy's hair brush
underneath my pillow this morning.

601
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,520
Full of her hair.

602
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,496
She does that, you know,

603
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,720
to let me know she's been a good girl
and brushed properly.

604
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,000
I usually clean it out but
today, for some reason...

605
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,960
How could he. How dare he...
A morality what?

606
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,496
Clause, he said.

607
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,896
Carol if I'm responsible in any way

608
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,880
don't you dare

609
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,520
don't you ever.

610
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,936
Anyway, I've got my eye

611
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,640
on this redhead who owns a steak house
outside of paramus.

612
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,656
Rita Hayworth I'm talking...
Serious Rita Hayworth redhead.

613
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,360
Really? You think you have
what it takes to handle a redhead?

614
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,240
You going somewhere?

615
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,080
- West.
- I thought

616
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,520
at least for a few weeks until the hearing.

617
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,840
What else am I going to do?

618
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,480
I know you don't like to drive alone. So.

619
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,800
She's young.

620
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,840
Tell me you know what you're doing.

621
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,680
I don't.

622
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,600
I never did

623
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,080
your landlady let me in.

624
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,960
Merry Christmas.

625
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,560
Open it.

626
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,360
Oh Carol.

627
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,040
It's not that good. I was rushed,

628
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,040
I mean...
I can do better.

629
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,880
It's perfect.

630
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,480
Is this you?

631
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,200
Um-huh.

632
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,776
Do you keep anything in

633
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,240
the icebox besides photo chemicals?
I'm feeling...

634
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,240
Sure.

635
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,880
Is there any point in, I don't know...
Fighting it?

636
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,800
The injunction?

637
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,680
No.

638
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,520
I feel useless.

639
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,680
Like I can't help you or offer anything

640
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,240
it has nothing to do with you.

641
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,720
I'm going away for a while.

642
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,400
When?... where?

643
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,440
Wherever my car will take me.

644
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,560
West.

645
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:38,920
Soon.

646
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,120
And I thought...
Perhaps you might like to come with me.

647
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:53,960
Would you?

648
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,680
Yes.

649
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,040
Yes, I would.

650
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,440
You don't know her.

651
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,800
You can forward any mail to Chicago,
general post

652
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,080
I've paid the rent through February.
I had a little extra

653
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,360
some money I saved

654
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,336
Terry for our trip. Our trip, Terry.

655
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,360
And now you're...

656
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,840
I don't believe this is happening!

657
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,040
I can't explain it. I just...

658
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,296
You've got one hell

659
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,920
of a crush on this women...
Like a schoolgirl.

660
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,056
I do not
I just like her is all.

661
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,080
I'm fond of anybody I can really talk to.

662
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,120
Nice

663
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,160
you know what I think?

664
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,600
I think two weeks form now,
you'll be wishing that

665
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,120
she'll get tired of you, and then
you'll gonna wish you were never...

666
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,256
You don't understand

667
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,016
I do,I understand completely.
You're in a trance!

668
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,996
I'm wide awake. I've never

669
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,000
felt more awake.
Why don't you leave me alone?

670
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,200
Are we over?
Is that what this is?

671
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,416
I didn't say that.

672
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,956
But why should I want to

673
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,520
be with you if all you do
is argue about this?

674
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,076
- To say
- to say for a minute you

675
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,016
practically want to say goodbye
because of some silly crush!

676
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,040
I didn't say that.
You said it?

677
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,120
You made me buy boat tickets,
I got a better job for you...

678
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,480
I asked you to marry me,
for christsakes.

679
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,916
I didn't make you do

680
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,320
anything. I never asked you for...
Anything.

681
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,080
Maybe that's the problem.

682
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,896
I swear to you, two weeks from

683
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,320
now you'll be begging me
to forget this ever!

684
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,336
Richard...
Richard!

685
00:58:54,360 --> 01:00:00,024
Have a great trip, Terry!

686
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,896
For you. Merry Christmas.

687
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,536
Oh no. You shouldn't have.

688
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,120
Open it.

689
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,360
I played it for you.
At your house.

690
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,720
I remember.

691
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,376
Thank you.

692
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,976
Oh god, I look a fright

693
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
no you do not,
you look wonderful.

694
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,520
Just stay like that.

695
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,320
Do you miss Richard?

696
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,760
No. I haven't thought about him all day.

697
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,160
Or of home. Really.

698
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,280
Home.

699
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,840
I have to speak to her.

700
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,440
What are you doing here?

701
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,880
You're supposed to be in Florida.

702
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,816
I couldn't do it.

703
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,600
Because rindy wanted
to be with her mother on Christmas.

704
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,856
Not that it's any of your business.

705
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,096
Just go get her.
I know she's here.

706
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,096
You've got some
fucking nerve ordering me around.

707
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,120
And, no. She's not here.

708
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,536
That's impossible.

709
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,536
She's not home.
She's not with me.

710
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,800
She must be with you.

711
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,476
You've spent ten years making

712
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,680
damned sure her only point
of reference is you,

713
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,136
your job, your friends, your family,
your...

714
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,160
Where is she. Goddamn it.

715
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,816
Abby she's still my wife, Abby.

716
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,856
She's my responsibility.

717
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,396
You should have thought of that

718
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,960
before you slapped her
with that injunction.

719
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,880
I'm closing the door.

720
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,800
I love her.

721
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,200
I can't help you with that.

722
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,720
Carol?

723
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,160
Therese, is that you?

724
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,176
Yes!

725
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,240
Would you be a sweetie and fetch
my red knit sweater?

726
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,696
It's in the big
suitcase on the bed.

727
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,400
Okay.

728
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,840
Hey, slowpoke...

729
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,000
Found it.

730
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,360
Thanks. Everything all right?

731
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,760
- I'm just
- suddenly starving.

732
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,720
I won't be a minute.

733
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,240
You hungry?

734
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,240
Sure.

735
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
Do you feel... safe.

736
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,376
With me, I mean?

737
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,240
You're full of surprises.

738
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,396
I mean you would tell me...

739
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,720
If something scared you.
And I could help.

740
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,280
I'm not frightened, therese.

741
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,416
Our standard rooms come equipped
with stereophonic console radios,

742
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,596
or if you prefer, the presidential

743
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,800
suite is available.
At a very attractive rate.

744
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,456
Two standard rooms should be fine.

745
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,480
Why not take the presidential suite?

746
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,720
If the rate's attractive...

747
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,720
Can I help you with that?

748
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,760
Thank you.

749
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,760
It's so cold.

750
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,680
So cold, my glasses have fogged
right the way over.

751
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,480
Here you go.

752
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,720
Thanks again. Night.

753
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,680
Night.

754
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,840
Don't blink.

755
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,400
There

756
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,520
I need lipstick.

757
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,000
Again.

758
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,640
Take a look at yourself.

759
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,880
Beautiful.

760
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,120
Next?

761
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,956
Would mademoiselle be so

762
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,800
kind as to apply at the pulse points only?

763
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,320
Me, too.

764
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,760
That's divine.

765
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:29,800
Smell that.

766
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,520
To president McKinley.

767
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,776
Good morning. Glad to see you
didn't freeze over or nothing.

768
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,720
You too.

769
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,240
I'm afraid the coffee is not very good

770
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,240
long as it's hot.

771
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,320
What's in the case?

772
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,280
Oh. Notions. I'm a
I sell them. Or try to.

773
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,936
Lousy coffee.

774
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,040
I'm sorry

775
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,880
excuse me?

776
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,216
We were just chatting.

777
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,240
Name's Tucker... Tommy

778
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,840
therese belivet Carol arid.

779
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,200
Pleased to meet you.

780
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,800
Mr. Tucker sells notions.

781
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,056
I see.

782
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,056
I don't really know what notions are.
Exactly.

783
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,016
But they do instruct us to use that word.

784
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,456
Sales appeals to women.

785
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,600
Do you sell lipstick?

786
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,680
No. But I have a sewing kit.

787
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,400
You don't need a sewing kit.
I can tell.

788
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,576
We should make Chicago

789
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,640
by five or six, if we get an early start.

790
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,336
I'm headlining.

791
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,016
There's a short cut across the

792
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,720
interstates, knocks three hours
off the drive.

793
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,240
Two hours that'll be something.

794
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,256
Can we stop to buy some magazines?

795
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:34,400
I have field and stream,
national geographic...

796
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,896
Popular photography?

797
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:42,560
Course not.
I am doomed to remain without a sale.

798
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,256
Is this alright?

799
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,480
Thank you so much.

800
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,880
Finally. A real bed.

801
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:36,880
Heaven.

802
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,520
And the furniture!

803
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,936
Good evening.

804
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,096
Table for two, please, for dinner.

805
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,976
Are you staying here at the hotel?

806
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,240
Yes, it's room...

807
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,320
623, Mrs. arid.

808
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,320
That'll be just a moment, Mrs. arid.

809
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,850
Therese belivet

810
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,440
hargess arid. Hello.

811
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,176
Someone's popular.

812
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,536
All from Richard.

813
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,936
Aren't you going to pick up your mail?

814
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:56,976
Nobody knows I'm here.

815
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,456
Were you... making a call?

816
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,000
What?

817
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,520
Ladies room.

818
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:34,730
Happy new year.

819
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,190
Happy new year.

820
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,050
Harge and I never spend
new year's Eve together.

821
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:59,590
There's always a business function,
always clients to entertain.

822
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,610
I've always spent new year's Eve alone.
In crowds.

823
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,420
I'm not alone this year.

824
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,740
Take me to bed.

825
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:12,630
I never looked like that.

826
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:23,510
You're trembling.

827
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,460
Don't. I want to see you.

828
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,520
My angel. Flung out of space.

829
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,510
What town is this again?

830
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:40,710
This? Waterloo. Isn't that awful?

831
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,106
You the folks in 42?

832
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,416
We're checking out.

833
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,790
Telegram come for you last night.

834
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,680
When did this arrive?

835
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:08,670
Early. Seven. Nine. I ain't a clock, lady.

836
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:23,236
Where's my suitcase?

837
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,206
I put it in the back.

838
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:26,236
I want my fucking suitcase.

839
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,386
Carol...
What's going on?

840
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:28,360
Carol!

841
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:37,170
Carol what are you going to do with that?
What happened?

842
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,460
Carol, you're scaring me.

843
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,800
Where's the tape, you son of a bitch.

844
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,886
How much is harge paying

845
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,546
you for this? I'll give you double, triple.

846
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:12,296
Whatever you want.

847
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,536
I wish I could oblige you, ma'am.

848
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,456
But the tape is already on,
its way to your husband.

849
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,460
That can't be right.

850
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,650
My reputation rests on my efficiency,
Mrs. arid.

851
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,120
How do I know you're not lying?

852
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,770
You don't. Ma'am

853
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:49,400
how could you.

854
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,691
I am a professional,

855
01:20:51,715 --> 01:20:53,230
miss belivet. It's not personal.

856
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,270
Let's get out of here.

857
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:08,970
There's nothing we can do.
As soon as we got the telegram

858
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:14,180
earliest flight into LaGuardia
is tomorrow afternoon...

859
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:19,006
Oh Abby, I don't know how to fix this...

860
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:20,530
I haven't the strength...

861
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,111
What are you thinking?

862
01:21:35,135 --> 01:21:37,986
You know how many times
a day I ask you that?

863
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:41,380
I'm sorry. What am I thinking?

864
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:44,826
I'm thinking that I'm utterly selfish.
And I

865
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:46,976
don't do this. You had no idea.

866
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,806
How could you have known?

867
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,246
I should have said no to you.

868
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,570
But I can never say no.

869
01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:57,346
And it's selfish because I take...
Everything.

870
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,716
And I don't know...
Anything.

871
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:00,416
I don't know what I want.

872
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,050
How could I if I say yes to everything?

873
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:23,100
I took what you gave willingly.

874
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:39,090
It's not your fault, therese.
Alright.

875
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:55,856
Thank you, darling.

876
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:00,960
You know. Shattered. Sickened.

877
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:04,836
I hope so.

878
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,376
Anything else you need?

879
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,326
Talk tomorrow.

880
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,316
Try to get some sleep. And don't worry.

881
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,136
I will. And thank you.

882
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,150
Night

883
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:22,800
you don't have to sleep over there.

884
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,560
She's gone?

885
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:56,130
Early this morning.

886
01:24:57,820 --> 01:24:59,220
Is she coming back?

887
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,130
No.

888
01:25:05,130 --> 01:25:06,780
This is all my fault.

889
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:09,010
Nonsense.

890
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,020
We should get going.

891
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:25,790
Eat something.

892
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,030
Suit yourself.

893
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,826
Why do you hate me?
I've never done anything to you.

894
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,816
Do you think I've flown halfway

895
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,806
across the country to drive you back east

896
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:47,380
because I hate you,
and want to see you suffer?

897
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,746
It's for Carol. Not for me.

898
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:51,390
That's...

899
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:05,940
With you and Carol, what happened?

900
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:09,441
Carol it's completely different.

901
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:12,020
I've known Carol since
I was 10 years old.

902
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:23,620
It was five or six years ago. Summer

903
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:25,876
late one night.

904
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:29,920
My Ford broke down at my mother's house.

905
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:34,740
We tried to stay up, but...

906
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:39,206
Curled up together in my old twin bed.

907
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:44,520
And that was it... for a while.

908
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,356
And then it changed.

909
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:52,530
It changes.

910
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,080
Nobody's fault.

911
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:07,230
So

912
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,080
Here, she...

913
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:32,540
Dearest. There are no accidents

914
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,770
and he would have found us
one way or another.

915
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,880
Everything comes full circle.

916
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:45,980
Be grateful it was sooner
rather than later.

917
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:50,986
You'll think it harsh of me to say so,

918
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:54,560
but no explanation I
offer will satisfy you.

919
01:27:58,630 --> 01:28:00,946
Please don't be angry when I tell you

920
01:28:00,970 --> 01:28:05,810
that you seek resolutions
and explanations because you're young.

921
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:09,310
But you will understand this one day.

922
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:39,996
And when it, happens,
I want you to imagine me there

923
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,160
to greet you.

924
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:47,210
Our lives stretched out ahead of us,
a perpetual sunrise.

925
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:04,996
But until then,
there must be no contact between us.

926
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:10,730
I have much to do, and you,
my darling, even more.

927
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:16,230
Please believe that I would do anything
to see you happy

928
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:43,270
and so I do the only thing I can...
I release you.

929
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:12,510
Hello?

930
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:17,170
Carol?

931
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:41,220
I miss you...
I miss you.

932
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:12,816
Therese, these are seriously

933
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,706
good. I mean, they really capture...
Whoever this is.

934
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:19,380
They're just practice.

935
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:32,310
You really wanna put together a portfolio.

936
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:38,266
Say the word,
I'll introduce you to my pal at the times.

937
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:40,640
There's always a clerk job going.

938
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:49,810
You went away with her, right?

939
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:51,760
Yes.

940
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:54,610
What happened?

941
01:32:56,370 --> 01:33:00,640
Ohh. Nothing. It's hard to...

942
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:04,816
Is it because I tried to kiss you that day?

943
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,211
Because if it is, don't even think

944
01:33:07,235 --> 01:33:09,606
about that, I mean, don't be afraid of...

945
01:33:09,630 --> 01:33:10,630
I'm not afraid.

946
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:21,140
Let's finish while we
still have light, okay?

947
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:29,706
I still think you have to put
together that portfolio.

948
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:31,160
Okay.

949
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,660
More mashed potatoes, Carol?

950
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,340
Yes, thanks. They look delicious.

951
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:51,680
Thank you..

952
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,121
Chester Marge rindy I thought...
Maybe...

953
01:34:02,145 --> 01:34:05,410
Chester and Marge would be here...
With rindy..

954
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:08,630
Marge said to go ahead, not to wait.

955
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,150
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

956
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,486
Harge tells us you've been

957
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:21,396
getting along quite well
with your doctor, Carol.

958
01:34:21,420 --> 01:34:23,816
And why shouldn't she be getting on well.

959
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,590
He is a very expensive doctor.

960
01:34:26,330 --> 01:34:30,880
Actually he's not a doctor
but a psychotherapist.

961
01:34:33,170 --> 01:34:35,946
Well he is very well regarded.

962
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:38,226
A Yale man, like your uncle.

963
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,030
Does that make him a doctor?

964
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:53,470
But I do like him.
Very much. He's been a great help.

965
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:02,616
Oh baby...
My baby girl…

966
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,690
mommy!

967
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,880
Look how much you've grown.

968
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,830
Give me a big squeeze.

969
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:18,910
That's a long trip,
you must be hungry sweetheart.

970
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,480
You want something to eat?

971
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:33,066
Stay. Stay.

972
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,450
Don't be daft.

973
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:47,620
I don't know if I can keep it happen,
Abby.

974
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:57,420
How many more
tomato aspic lunches...

975
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:04,100
Then I come home every night without her.

976
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:07,240
To what like this!

977
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:10,820
And therese?

978
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:18,446
What about her?

979
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:20,740
Have you heard anything?

980
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:26,990
Oh no. No.

981
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:31,456
It's been over a month
since she tried to call.

982
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:39,460
Nothing since then. I wish I...

983
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:44,296
Have you? Heard anything?

984
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,990
From therese? No.

985
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:51,870
She must have started her job at the times,
though.

986
01:37:57,730 --> 01:38:04,920
I should have said: Therese. Wait.

987
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,410
Who the hell is turning around in my drive?

988
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:17,576
I should go.

989
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,466
You don't have to.

990
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:20,650
I do.

991
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:26,306
We expect given the
seriousness of the charges

992
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:28,966
and the incontestability of the evidence,

993
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:33,116
the court will grant solo custody
of the child to my client.

994
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:34,310
Not so fast, Jerry.

995
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:38,416
My client's psychotherapist
is perfectly satisfied

996
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,806
with her recovery from...
The events of the winter

997
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:43,956
and is more than capable of caring
for her child.

998
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:48,130
She's had no further contact
with the girl in question.

999
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:50,631
We have the sworn

1000
01:39:50,655 --> 01:39:52,636
depositions of two saddle brook
institute psychiatrists

1001
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:55,176
clearly stating that, in their opinions,

1002
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,716
a series of events, precipitated
by my client's husband,

1003
01:39:57,740 --> 01:39:59,926
drove her to suffer an emotional break.

1004
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:01,636
Which resulted in this described behavior.

1005
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:02,746
That's absurd!

1006
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:03,516
Furthermore…

1007
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:06,546
alright Fred this is how
you're going to play this.

1008
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:06,821
Furthermore, given the manner in which

1009
01:40:06,845 --> 01:40:07,096
these tapes were obtained and recorded

1010
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,550
we're confident in their inadmissibility...

1011
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:10,726
Okay. First off, I'd

1012
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,130
like to see these depositions.
And second...

1013
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:13,980
Fred... please.
Don't... may I speak?

1014
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:18,136
I won't deny the truth of what's contained
in those tapes.

1015
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:18,926
This is off the record, honey.

1016
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:20,170
Might as well be on the record.

1017
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:28,340
Harge. I want you to be happy.

1018
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:33,126
I didn't give you that.
I failed you.

1019
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:34,626
We both could have given. More.

1020
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:38,410
But we gave each other rindy,

1021
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:45,210
and that's the most breathtaking,
the most generous of gifts.

1022
01:40:46,090 --> 01:40:48,431
Why are we spending so

1023
01:40:48,455 --> 01:40:50,820
much time trying to keep
her from each other.

1024
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:57,316
What happened with therese,
I wanted.

1025
01:40:57,340 --> 01:41:03,306
And I will not deny it or say that I reg..

1026
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:06,216
But I do regret, I grieve

1027
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:09,150
the mess we're about to make
of our child's life.

1028
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:12,820
Harge we are both responsible.

1029
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,810
Let's set it right.

1030
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:27,326
I think that harge should
have custody of rindy.

1031
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:29,260
Could I suggest that let's
take a break, folks

1032
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:29,856
Fred, no.

1033
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:32,446
Fred. Let me have my speak.

1034
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:33,416
Because if you don't...

1035
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,370
I won't be able to cope

1036
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:38,096
I'm no martyr.

1037
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,836
I have no clue what's best for me.

1038
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:42,516
But I do know. I feel it

1039
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:44,220
in my bones what is best for my daughter.

1040
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:49,286
I want visits with her, harge.

1041
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:50,826
I don't care if they're supervised.

1042
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:52,540
But they need to be regular.

1043
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:59,680
There was a time when
I would've done most anything

1044
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:04,570
I would've locked myself away
to keep rindy with me.

1045
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:08,841
But what use am

1046
01:42:08,865 --> 01:42:11,570
I to her, to us,
living against my own grain

1047
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:14,676
so that's the deal.

1048
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:17,006
I won't... I cannot negotiate anymore.

1049
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:19,040
Take it or leave it.

1050
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:23,410
If you leave it, we go to court.

1051
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:28,276
We go to court and it will get ugly.

1052
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:31,430
We're not ugly people, harge.

1053
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,770
Carol, Carol.

1054
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:38,260
Belivet

1055
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:46,200
hand delivered. Swank.

1056
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,300
I wasn't sure you'd come.

1057
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,326
It's nice of you to see me.

1058
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:00,350
Don't say that.

1059
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,596
Do you hate me, therese?

1060
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:08,280
How could I hate you?

1061
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:18,546
Abby tells me you're thriving.

1062
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:22,516
You've no idea
how pleased I am for you.

1063
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:26,340
You look very fine, you know.

1064
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:29,646
As if you've suddenly blossomed.

1065
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:33,676
Is that what comes
of getting away from me?

1066
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:34,450
No.

1067
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:47,436
What?

1068
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:48,790
Nothing.

1069
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:56,656
Harge and I are selling the house.

1070
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,690
I've taken an apartment on Madison Avenue.

1071
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:04,606
And a job, believe it or not.

1072
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:06,886
I'm going to work for a

1073
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:09,190
furniture house on fourth
Avenue as a buyer.

1074
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,540
Have you seen rindy?

1075
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,450
Once or twice.

1076
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:22,176
She's living with harge for now.

1077
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:26,150
It's the right thing.

1078
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:40,160
Anyway, the apartment's a nice big one...
Big enough for two.

1079
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:44,596
I was hoping you might
like to come and live with me,

1080
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:50,870
but I guess you won't. Would you?

1081
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:57,750
I don't think so.

1082
01:47:00,710 --> 01:47:03,081
I'm meeting some people

1083
01:47:03,105 --> 01:47:05,476
at the furniture house
at the oak room at nine.

1084
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,476
If you want to have dinner...

1085
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,556
If you change your mind...

1086
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:10,660
I think you'd like them.

1087
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:25,010
Well. That's that.

1088
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:41,460
I love you.

1089
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:45,490
Therese? Is that you?

1090
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:48,570
What do you know!

1091
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:51,426
I'm saying to myself, I know that girl.

1092
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:52,266
Jack.

1093
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:53,446
It's great to see you, therese.

1094
01:47:53,470 --> 01:47:54,776
It's been, well, months.

1095
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,500
Months.

1096
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,910
Jack, this is Carol arid.

1097
01:47:58,520 --> 01:47:59,446
Pleased to meet you.

1098
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:00,380
Likewise.

1099
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:03,846
Hey, Ted gray's meeting me here

1100
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:05,676
and a bunch of us are going down
to Phil's party.

1101
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,126
You're going aren't you?

1102
01:48:07,150 --> 01:48:09,326
Yes. I just planned to
get there a little...

1103
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:10,210
You should go ahead.

1104
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,660
You coming along?

1105
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:13,596
No.

1106
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:16,140
I should make a few calls before dinner,
anyway.

1107
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:18,370
I should really run.

1108
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:20,560
You sure?

1109
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,280
Of course.

1110
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:28,206
Well, it would be great to catch a ride.

1111
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:29,320
Yeah, sure.

1112
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:34,826
You two have a wonderful night.

1113
01:48:34,850 --> 01:48:36,276
Nice meeting you, Jack.

1114
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,190
Nice meeting you.

1115
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:45,006
Alright, well let me go
make sure the loaf is on his way.

1116
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:46,510
Back in a flash.

1117
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:30,870
Yes, right up here.

1118
01:49:41,150 --> 01:49:43,146
It's about time, belivet.

1119
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:45,956
Say hello at least
it hasn't been that long!

1120
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:47,836
- Hello
- Phil sorry, I was...

1121
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:49,950
There she is!
Get up there!

1122
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:51,956
What?

1123
01:49:51,980 --> 01:49:55,990
Nothing! There better be beer. Or wine.

1124
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:44,386
You can have her, she's one

1125
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:47,056
of these real greenwich village
phonies if you ask me.

1126
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,206
I'm gonna remember that. Charles.

1127
01:50:49,230 --> 01:50:53,140
Where are you going Ted?
Stick around a minute.

1128
01:50:54,710 --> 01:50:57,556
You're Phil's friend, aren't you?

1129
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:59,830
I... am. Yes. I'm dannie's.

1130
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:02,520
Aren't you going to ask me how I knew that?

1131
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:05,690
Aren't most people here Phil's friends?

1132
01:51:06,380 --> 01:51:08,820
I can see why Phil speaks so highly of you.

1133
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:10,810
Can you?

1134
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:23,690
Sorry I'll be out in a minute.

1135
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,156
Do you have a reservation?

1136
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:34,756
Sorry I'm looking for someone.

1137
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:36,620
I'm sorry ma'am,
I can't seat you without...
