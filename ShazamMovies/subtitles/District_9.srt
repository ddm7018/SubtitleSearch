1
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,040
You know, after last year's corporate,
my wife was always encouraging me.

2
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,440
You know, she said: you did fine,
you did fine in the corporate.

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,480
I was a bit nervous.
This little guy... hello. Sorry.

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,760
That's nice, eh? Nice background
with the people there...

5
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,400
We are here at the... must I look..?
-Just look straight at the lens.

6
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,240
We are here at the...
MNU head office,

7
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,520
Department of Alien Affairs.
My name is Wikus Van De Merwe.

8
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,960
And behind me you can see
the Alien Affairs' workers.

9
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,080
And what we do here
at this department is...

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,880
we try to engage with the Prawn

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,000
on behalf of MNU
and on behalf of humans.

12
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,480
To everyone's surprise,
the ship didn't come to a stop

13
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,400
over Manhattan
or Washington or Chicago,

14
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,720
but instead it costed to a halt
directly over the city of Johannesburg.

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,360
The doors didn't open for 3 months.
It just hovered there. Nobody could get in.

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,080
And they eventually decided,
after much deliberation,

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,200
that the best thing to do would be
to physically cut their way in.

18
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,640
We were on the verge
of first contact.

19
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,440
The whole world was watching.

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,840
Expecting, I don't know...

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,920
...music from heaven
and bright shining lights.

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,720
Oh my God!

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,520
The creatures were
extremely malnourished,

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,000
they were very unhealthy,
they seemed to be aimless.

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,120
There was a lot of international
pressure on us at the time.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,640
The entire world was
looking at Johannesburg,

27
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,840
so we had to do the right thing.

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,880
The government then established
an aid group that started to

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,080
ferry the aliens to a temporary camp
set up just beneath the ship.

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,800
We didn't have a plan.
There was a million of them.

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,320
So, what was a temporary
holding zone soon became fenced,

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,320
became militarized. And before
we knew it, it was a slum.

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,040
But the truth is, nobody really
knew what this place was.

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,040
There's a lot of secrets
in District 9.

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
At first, a lot of attention
was given to...

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,560
giving the aliens a proper status
and protection.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,760
They're spending so much money
to keep them here.

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,760
When they could be spending it
on other things, but...

39
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,720
...at least they're keeping them
separate from us.

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,840
l want to be realistic with everyone.
The aliens will not be able to go home.

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,640
The aliens are here to stay.

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,320
There were literally thousands
of different theories

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,280
as to why the ship seemed inoperable,
and what was speculated was that

44
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,400
the command module had detached
itself from the main ship,

45
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,800
and then somehow
mysteriously became lost.

46
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Did it fall by itself or was it
programmed? I don't know.

47
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,120
Examination of the
old video footage

48
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,120
shows very clearly
that a piece falls from the ship.

49
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,560
We look for it.
We look everywhere.

50
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,160
This piece that's falling
caused us bloody problems.

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,600
More energy weapon caches found.

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,360
The Special task force
conducted raids in District 9.

53
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,760
Where there's a weapon, there's crime.
Tensions rose, and rose.

54
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,520
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,080
Residents in Tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,640
in an attempt to remove
all the aliens from their township.

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,960
I think they must fix that ship
and they must go.

58
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,520
A virus, a selective virus.
Release it near the aliens.

59
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,840
They must just go.
I don't know where, just go.

60
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,360
If they was from another country
we might understand.

61
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,280
But they are not
even from this planet.

62
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,960
The government have enforced
a nationwide curfew.

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,120
The aliens, prawns,
they take my wife away.

64
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,800
The derogatory term Prawn is used
for the alien, and obviously it implies

65
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,760
something that is a bottom feeder,
that scavenges the leftovers.

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,080
I mean, you can't say
they don't look like that.

67
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,360
That's what they look like, right?
They look like prawns.

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,840
The aliens made off with an undisclosed
amount of cash. One bystander was hurt.

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,200
What for an alien might be seen
as something recreational,

70
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,320
setting fire to a truck,
derailing a train,

71
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,760
is for us obviously
an extremely destructive act.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,160
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.

73
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,600
They take whatever you have on you.
Your cell phone or anything.

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,400
After that they kill you.

75
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,120
And now, after 20 years, public
pressure had forced the government

76
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,920
to shift the aliens
out of Johannesburg.

77
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,800
They had had enough and they
wanted District 9 to be moved,

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,080
and more intensively
policed and controlled.

79
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,800
So, to enforce this mass eviction,
the government turned to MNU.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,280
Welcome all
and thank you for coming.

81
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Please listen very closely
to this briefing.

82
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,000
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.

83
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,600
This is the largest operation
that MNU has ever undertaken,

84
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,640
and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully.

85
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,920
It is to move 1.8 million prawns

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,600
from their present home in District 9
to a safer and better location

87
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,480
200 kilometers outside of
Johannesburg City.

88
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,440
We built a nice new facility
where the prawn can go,

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,280
he can be comfortable,
he can stay there...

90
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,120
The people of Johannesburg and
of South Africa are going to live

91
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,320
happily and safely, knowing that
that prawn is very far away.

92
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,520
UIO protocol dictates
that we give the aliens

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,160
24 hours notice
of our right to evict.

94
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,640
Today, you will serve these notices
getting the aliens to sign I-27 form.

95
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,440
The legality that MNU is using to evict
the aliens is simply a whitewash.

96
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,240
I'm going to appoint a field officer
to take direct command.

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,920
Wikus Van De Merwe.

98
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,360
Everybody always said that
Wikus was not a very smart boy,

99
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,920
but he was a wonderful son.
That was my Wikus, just...

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,640
Feels like life on the big stage.
Thank you Piet... Mr Smith.

101
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,160
l had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to Wikus.

102
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,200
That didn't affect my decision
to promote him.

103
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,880
It's almost as big as my wedding day.
You know... not as big.

104
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,720
Wikus was always making me things.

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,680
He said that way
they just mean so much more.

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,720
He left this paper-mache bowl
on the sofa one day

107
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,880
and I didn't see it and I sat down,
and I... kinda squashed it.

108
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,040
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation, and...

109
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,200
I made them bring it all back.

110
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,200
Hey, congratulations, man!
-Thanks, man.

111
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,560
Okay, we're gonna go to District.
-Wikus! -How is it going, man?

112
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,280
Here's the shake.
B9 for you. -Thanks.

113
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm not saying
what he did was right, but...

114
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,960
he took the choices
that were given to him.

115
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,720
This is Trent.
Fundiswa, Trent. -Hi.

116
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,800
Fundiswa is the guy that
I've selected to replace me.

117
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,680
If he can make it today, eh?
-I'll make it.

118
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,760
I just want everyone
watching this right now

119
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,240
to learn from what has happened.
-You would think...

120
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,040
things like this would happen
to somebody else, not to me.

121
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,040
How is it going, man? Long time,
mate. Have you got my stuff?

122
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
Hey, boss! -How is it going?
-I'm all right, boss.

123
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,600
Good, good, this is Fundiswa.
He is driving with us today.

124
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,480
I think I was disgusted with
the way he worked.

125
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,440
There was always just a hint
of something not quite kosher

126
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,240
with mr Van De Merwe.
-Nobody saw it coming at all.

127
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,960
None of us had any idea
of what he was doing.

128
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,480
l think it is a great
thing to see that...

129
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,680
it's not the military guys
in charge this time.

130
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,920
Not to say that Koobus
and his cowboys are not wanted.

131
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,960
You guys are always wanted.

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,760
You see now,
these are the cowboys.

133
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
They shoot first, and then
they answer the questions.

134
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,400
Sorry, is this above the allocated
amount of ammunition?

135
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,640
Because I see your
pouches are full but...

136
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,600
I think maybe you should
speak to the colonel.

137
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,600
F.A.G. over here says that
we got too much ammunition.

138
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,240
No, all I'm saying, Koobus,
is that, you know...

139
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,240
you should find ways of making
you guys more efficient...

140
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,440
Listen to me, you fuck!

141
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Get him outta my face.

142
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,880
There are rules, we're all living
by rules in this world.

143
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,280
Well, l don't think he can
be forgiven for what he did,

144
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,280
cause it's like a betrayal.
-I've gotta get going, Les.

145
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,240
I think we're gonna have to cut
this interview, cause we're gonna go...

146
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,680
12 KILOMETERS FROM DISTRICT 9

147
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,280
Take your magazines, people.
Come on, lets go.

148
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,760
The Prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.

149
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,400
So, we have to come there and say:
listen, this is our land.

150
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,080
Please, will you go?

151
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,440
It's difficult to put
the vest on by yourself.

152
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,480
Thomas, can you help me?
-All right, boss.

153
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,080
They told me I was gonna
get the vest inside the Casper.

154
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,840
Thomas, just look on the side
if there's a vest there?

155
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,040
I'm just concerned about my family.
-Don't worry about the vest, it'll be fine.

156
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,200
Rights groups have demanded
that mercenaries should comply

157
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,160
with all UIO regulations
in District 9.

158
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,760
We're coming to you
from the entrance of District 9

159
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,520
as today, Multi National United
sets out to relocate

160
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,440
approximately 1.8 million
alien residents from their homes.

161
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,360
Human rights groups are
keeping a watchful eye,

162
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,400
as many suspect
abuses might occur.

163
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,360
We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces

164
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
being deployed into District 9.

165
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,040
Backed up by
significant air support.

166
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,640
We'll go shack to shack
and get them to sign the form.

167
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,440
First one E.X. triple 7.

168
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,080
We're seeing the convoy stop.
The operation is about to begin.

169
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
Just stay focused.

170
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,160
Are you ready, Thomas?
-Yeah. -Okay.

171
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,400
Is that a signal?
Okay, fellows.

172
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,520
You stay behind us.
Good luck, boy.

173
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,080
Stay low! Where is he going?
What is it?

174
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,600
It's clear that security is very high.

175
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,160
This is only the beginning
of a total clamp down.

176
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,480
This is MNU agents.
Open the door please! -Open up!

177
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,480
Hello! Hello, hello...

178
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,040
This is Wikus Van De Merwe
from MNU.

179
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,440
We are here to serve you
an eviction notice.

180
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,240
You just put your scrawl there.
-Fuck off!

181
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,560
All right! Thomas, hold it!
We've got his scrawl there.

182
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,920
Because as he hit it,
it counts as a scrawl.

183
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,760
First time we come in,
there will always be a little bit

184
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,320
of tension happening
between us and them.

185
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,920
Hey, you can't eat that, man!

186
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,000
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
To him it's like a marshmallow.

187
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,280
No, no! Guard!
Don't confront him like that!

188
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,520
Did you see that?
Right in the roost. Stay calm!

189
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,000
This is gonna be a problem cause
now all prawns are coming out,

190
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,760
they wanna see what's going on.
Stop it! Stop it!

191
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,440
Bring my kit.
See, everybody is gathering now.

192
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,280
Don't shoot or you're gonna
turn it into a warzone!

193
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,240
What is that? Is that a tear gas?
-No, it's cat food.

194
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,680
It is cat food.
I just distract them.

195
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,120
No it's not my house.
I don't live here.

196
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,160
Well, that's a pity because,
you know, this...

197
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,200
This is a nice cat food, you know.
But of course, it's not your house.

198
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,280
So, we'll just have to go and give it
to someone else. -Yes! It's my house!

199
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,440
We need you to sign here.
Now you can take that...

200
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,920
All right. Stop it!

201
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,320
The creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food.

202
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,680
Something about it, like catnip
for cats. Only a lot more intense.

203
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,280
Hello? MNU. We are here
to serve eviction notices.

204
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,880
What is eviction?

205
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,440
What we have stranded
on Earth in this colony,

206
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,640
is basically the workers that are
unable to think for themselves.

207
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,440
They will take commands,
they have no initiative.

208
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,840
They've lost all the
apt of leadership

209
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,800
through whatever cause.
We presume illness.

210
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,680
I'm holding steady over
Nigerian compound area.

211
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,480
Where there's a slum, there's crime.
And District 9 was no exception.

212
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,440
The nigerians had various scams going.
One of them was the cat food scam.

213
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,400
Where they sold cat food to
the aliens for exorbitant prices.

214
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,520
You put the money here first.
You don't get anything until you pay.

215
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,720
What are you trying to do?
I'll chop your balls off.

216
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,680
Not to mention
interspecies prostitution,

217
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,400
and they also dealt
in alien weaponry.

218
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there,

219
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,080
you can see that,
that's somebody's car in there.

220
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,400
The nigerians in District 9 are
headed by a man called Obesandjo.

221
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,680
He's a very powerful
underground figure in Johannesburg.

222
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,800
You don't want to play
with these boys.

223
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,000
They will cut you into pieces.

224
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,480
That's the boss there.
OK, no problem.

225
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,400
Don't look at him!
This is gonna cause problems.

226
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,200
All right, next. 766, all right.

227
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,560
MNU agents.
Open the door please!

228
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,640
Whoa! Jesus! What is it?

229
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,400
Check the other side!

230
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,640
Control, this is Wikus Van De Merwe.

231
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,600
I need a population control team
at JV 766 immediately, please.

232
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,280
Check the other side, Thomas!
There is 40 to 50 eggs in here.

233
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,440
Is this normal?
-This is an amazing find.

234
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,680
l can just show you
a little bit how it works.

235
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,680
Basically, a cow is hung from
the ceiling, you can see here.

236
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,720
Very little of it left, of course,
because all these pipes

237
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,680
supply the nutrition
to the little prawn eggs.

238
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,480
You can do one, I can show you,
want to see? -No, I'm fine.

239
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,040
There we go. Okay,
no more nutrition to the guy.

240
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,880
Then finally we take air back.

241
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,840
The little guy is gone
to a nice little sleep now.

242
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,280
You pop him out, there we go.
Pop him out here.

243
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,320
You can take that. You wanna keep it
as a souvenir of your first abortion.

244
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,520
You can feel like you did
one of these here. -Thanks, boss.

245
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,240
Okay, here it comes, guys.
This is the snake.

246
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,880
If we were going to abort
each egg one at the time,

247
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,240
it'd take a very long time.
So, this makes a lot of sense.

248
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,960
You hear that? That's a popping
sound that you're hearing.

249
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
It's almost like a popcorn.

250
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,640
What the egg does, it pops up.

251
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,600
The little guy, what's left of him,
pops out there.

252
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,760
So that's the sound that
you're hearing with the popping.

253
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,920
You don't need that, man.
Only sissies wear that.

254
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,880
Been drinking a little bit here, eh?

255
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,920
What are you doing with this
television set, sir? What's this?

256
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
Hey, smile for the cameras here.

257
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,000
That's a first day find.
-That's a big find.

258
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,800
You see this? Trent, look at this!
There's weapons all over here.

259
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,280
CK 5, 7572...

260
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,520
Some of the guns are small

261
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,880
but if it shoot you,
it make a big mess.

262
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,000
MNU is trying to move the aliens
for humanitarian reasons.

263
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,200
But the real focus,
just as it has been

264
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,800
right from the beginning,
is weapons.

265
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,960
MNU is the second largest
weapons manufacturer in the world.

266
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,960
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien laser gun

267
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,760
and just be able to shoot,
but it didn't work like that.

268
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,400
Because, as we discovered,
their technology is actually

269
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,960
engineered in a biological manner
to interact exclusively with their DNA.

270
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,720
It just doesn't work with humans.
And it's as simple as that.

271
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,320
This is basically a guy,
and there's 3 humans here.

272
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,040
Basically trying to make
a warning, you know.

273
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,240
He's saying "I kill 3 humans,
watch out for me."

274
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,600
Hey, don't urinate on your
own bloody... get back, get back.

275
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,880
This is Wikus, requesting
First Battalion escort, please.

276
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,680
You want to talk to them
or you want to talk to me?

277
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,400
No, not them!

278
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,800
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah I know, he had a spade.

279
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,120
Look-I find some!

280
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,440
I tell you before... this is
human technology, it is useless.

281
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,720
Only our technology
contains the fluid.

282
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,520
This is not our technology?
-No, it's junk.

283
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,640
Keep looking.

284
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,040
I find something.

285
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,960
Yes. This is what we need.

286
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,480
Good, little one.

287
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,760
Get down!

288
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,800
Careful... wait...

289
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,040
...there.

290
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,640
Why must it take so long?

291
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,720
Because it is very difficult...

292
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,840
...so much can go wrong.

293
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,040
Twenty years of work.

294
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,640
Our plan is ready now?
-Quiet... listen...

295
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,760
...they are coming.

296
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,440
You must hide this.
They must not find it.

297
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,760
Answer the door and be polite.

298
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,280
No! You take it.

299
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,240
You see, this is the problem.
This is the gang sign.

300
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,920
You see this? So again,
looks like we have

301
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,320
more and more gang members.

302
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,920
Fundiswa, you just stay back.
You stay behind Thomas.

303
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,480
This place is swarming with MNU.
I will be searched.

304
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,400
I must get back to my son.
Don't make them angry - be polite!

305
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,920
MNU agents, open the door please.

306
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,280
Hello? We would like you to...
-Nobody is here.

307
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,840
Okay, that's unexceptable.
That is totally unexceptable!

308
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,880
Get out! Get out!
You stupid prawn!

309
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,080
-Get outside!
-C'mon! Move! Move!

310
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,800
On your knees!
-I'm gonna have a look.

311
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,880
Just stay there!
Right there!

312
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,760
Sir, we have to serve you
an eviction notice.

313
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,800
Do you understand it?
-No.

314
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,960
This is a classic kind of
gangsta shack, I can tell you.

315
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,760
We're gonna find weapons here.
Watch your head, don't hit the cows.

316
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,960
Just checking for panels.
Ah, you hear that?

317
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,520
Yeah, it's hollow there.

318
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,640
See? Look at that!

319
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,440
I haven't see this type of setup.
It's almost like a...

320
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,200
chemistry type of a set.

321
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,360
It's gotta be something.

322
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,120
l don't know, this has got
the markings there of...

323
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,040
...so it is definitely alien.

324
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,800
But it's not a weapon.
But I don't trust it.

325
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,040
Are you all right?
Wikus, are you all right?

326
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,280
Switch it off, please.
Just turn it off.

327
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
Are you gonna cut that part out,
Trent, where it sprays me?

328
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,960
-Yeah, don't worry.
-You cut that.

329
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,240
We just found
a dangerous object here.

330
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,760
It has a fuel in and I suspect it might
leak onto people or cause damage.

331
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,600
So we just check that in and we
take that down nicely to the lab.

332
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,920
It's not a weapon
but it's dangerous.

333
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,280
He's got weapons somewhere here,
my sense is telling me that.

334
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,000
Lets check the other side here.
Thomas! -Yes sir?

335
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,400
Thomas, keep the gun on him.
-OK, I got it sir!

336
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep the gun on him, Thomas,
there's weapons here!

337
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,360
Oh, this is Christmas!
This is Christmas, my friends.

338
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,880
This is the biggest find
that I've ever seen.

339
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,120
Control, come in.
Wikus Van De Merwe,

340
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,920
requesting
First Reaction Battalion.

341
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,440
Stand by, guys!

342
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,640
This gun I've never seen.
Have you seen this?

343
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,800
This is amazing! Look at this gun.
What gun is this?

344
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,040
This is absolutely amazing!

345
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,440
-What are you doing?
-I wanna show this to Thomas.

346
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,480
But I thought you said
you can't handle it.

347
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,480
No, I am not handling it,
I'm just gonna show it.

348
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm not gonna use it, man.
It doesn't even work with humans.

349
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,880
Thomas, look at this gun!

350
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,680
-That's not mine.
-You're a dealer, eh? -No.

351
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,640
You hear this, sir?
You see what's happening?

352
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,280
First Battalion, my friend.
You know what that means?

353
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,880
That means that your days
of flaunting the law are over.

354
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,280
Have a look, you see that?
What's that?

355
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,520
That's a firing team.

356
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,320
Come here!

357
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,560
Wikus! Are you all right?

358
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,520
Where do you think
you're going, eh?

359
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,080
You don't run away
from the chopper. -No, no...

360
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,680
Where do you think you're going?
You wanna piss me off?

361
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,040
Koobus to base, come in!

362
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,640
I've got two people down.
MNU guard, MNU agent.

363
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,680
It's the Foxtrot Yankee
5-3-0... copy?

364
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,360
And we need a Med Evac ASAP.

365
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,240
No, that's fine, Koobus.
I don't need a Med Evac.

366
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,720
Wikus, you burned your arm,
you need to...

367
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,680
I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

368
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,880
Sir, I really think you must go to
a doctor, a hospital or something.

369
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,360
-No, no. -You should
just get it checked out.

370
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,600
I'll just have it treated
by the medics. Help me up.

371
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,200
Did you see how fast
that prawn was, Trent?

372
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,240
-Yeah, he was fast.
-He was fast, I promise you.

373
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,080
Look, I fix it.
I make it work.

374
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,160
I told you not to touch that.

375
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,640
What is wrong?

376
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,800
Nothing. Go outside
and watch for humans.

377
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,880
Where is your friend?

378
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,280
He's gone.

379
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,080
Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm just a bit hot.

380
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,040
Are you guys hot?
Are you hot, Trent? -No.

381
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,920
Yeah, if you can't stand the heat
get out of the kitchen.

382
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,680
Now you see how
their kids are living.

383
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,760
This is what I mean.
This is why they get grilled.

384
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,160
-The little ones.
-Yeah, that's why we abort.

385
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,720
Lets just shoot the little bastard.
-No, no, don't shoot it now.

386
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,320
MNU agents! Come out!

387
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,920
Hello, little guy.
MNU has sweets for you.

388
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,600
There you go, eat your sweety.

389
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,760
You know, eaty sweety.
Works like a charm every time.

390
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,360
Oh fuck, man!

391
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,840
You almost poked my eye out
with the fokkin' lollypop.

392
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,560
I tried to be fokkin'
nice to you, man!

393
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,120
Is this your fokkin'
little brat here?

394
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,080
Inside, go!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

395
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,720
Teach him some manners.
Thomas, get him out.

396
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,920
Come! Get down! I've had
enough of your stupid games.

397
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,440
What do you want?

398
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,920
We're from MNU.
-I know.

399
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,920
We require your scrawl
on this eviction notification.

400
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,880
-Why am I being evicted?
-Yes, it's an eviction notice.

401
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,240
Put your scrawl on the bottom.
See? There's your name at the top.

402
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,240
-Yes! -Christopher Johnson?
So, put your name in the bottom.

403
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,640
It says you must
give me 24 hours notice.

404
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,760
You're going to another place. A nice
new city built especially for prawns.

405
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,720
-A special place! -And we are not
even going to charge you, okay?

406
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,000
This isn't legal.
-Sign the fokkin' paper! -No!

407
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,160
This guy is obviously...
he's a little sharper.

408
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,160
So we are gonna
have to try something else.

409
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,480
All right. Hello... okay.

410
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,880
Seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?

411
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,240
So, you've got a little one there.

412
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,840
Do you have a licence
for that little one? -Yes.

413
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,400
There's a litter out here. This is
dangerous conditions for your child.

414
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,600
Article 75 says that because
your child is living in dangerous

415
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,400
conditions, I'm gonna take him
down to Child Services.

416
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,600
I'm gonna go and have
a little chat with your son.

417
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,000
You keep away from my child!

418
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,160
Don't point your
fokkin' tentacles at me!

419
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,160
You said you want to stay?

420
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,960
Your boy is coming down with me
to Child Services.

421
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,960
He's gonna spend the rest
of his life in 1 by 1 meter box.

422
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,640
Hello, little guy!
It's the sweety man coming!

423
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,560
Fuck, look at this, Trent!
Fuck it!

424
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,440
Thomas, keep the gun on him.
He is definitely a criminal!

425
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,600
He's got a whole
computer shop here, man!

426
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,760
You know, this is amazing.
I mean, this is obviously...

427
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,280
you can see stolen computers now
that he's decorating his place with.

428
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,080
Definitely he doesn't have
the permit for this.

429
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,080
Where is that fokkin' little brat?

430
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,280
Hello! It's the sweety man...

431
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,840
It's the sweety...
Hey, I've got this...

432
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,400
-Wikus!
-Trent, turn it off!

433
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,440
Are you okay, boss?
-Fuck off, man! Fuck off!

434
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,080
Shall I leave him?
-Just fuckin' leave him, yeah.

435
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,480
I'll see you tomorrow,
Christopher Johnson.

436
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,120
<i>When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite, but firm.</i>

437
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,480
<i>And always remember that
a smile is cheaper than a bullet.</i>

438
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,520
Are you feeling better?
-What? -How are you feeling?

439
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,600
I'm fine, I'm alright.
I'm just a little bit dizzy.

440
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,520
Can you just pull up
there on the side?

441
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,200
I just want to get
something to eat here.

442
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,720
Are you sure you should
be having that?

443
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,920
After your whole puking episode?

444
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,480
I feel a lot better... I think
I just needed the fillings, you know.

445
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,600
Boss! Boss!

446
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,520
There's black stuff
coming out of your nose.

447
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,720
Jesus!

448
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,400
It's a silver cylinder.
I can't find it.

449
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,840
We must find it.
It contains the fluid.

450
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,880
It's not here.

451
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,840
It has to be. Keep looking.

452
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,040
We trade for ten thousand cans.

453
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,800
Certain factions of nigerian gangs

454
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,280
want to try and extract
weaponry from District 9.

455
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,800
And have been trying to
for many many years.

456
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,560
Give them one hundred cans.
-Hundred. -One hundred!

457
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,160
Yes, yes, but we take them all now.

458
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,720
Alright, boys!
Get them the catfood - hurry up.

459
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,480
And they amassed
thousands of these weapons.

460
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,280
Without the ability to use them.

461
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,360
Fuck off! Go!
Hey friend, not you. You stay here.

462
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,600
-What do you want from me?
-I just want to talk.

463
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,960
Talk about what?

464
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,760
Stupid prawn.
They'll believe anything.

465
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,600
Muti is a South African word.

466
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,000
Today it's synonymous
with witchdoctory and magic.

467
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,480
You cut it here.
This is their heart.

468
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,000
Cures high blood
when you boil it,

469
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,000
cures sugar, diabetes,
all diseases.

470
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,600
The nigerians were consuming
alien body parts.

471
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,600
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power

472
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,480
to use alien weaponry.

473
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,200
You must eat them.

474
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,840
And their power will live in you.

475
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,400
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man!

476
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,480
Oh, baby! -Hi baby, come in!
-I need to get to the toilet, quickly!

477
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,800
Why? What's the matter?

478
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,760
Baby, listen. I might have
crapped in my pants. -Surprise!

479
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,160
What's this for? -Your promotion.
-All right, my promotion!

480
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,880
Hello, dad. How is it going?
Hi mom. -Good to see you.

481
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,440
What a surprise, man!
-Congratulations. -Thanks.

482
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,320
Congratulations, boss.
-Thank you.

483
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,560
-Wikus, what happened?
-I had a small incident, baby.

484
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,920
I'm just gonna go to the toilet,
and then I'll talk to people, okay?

485
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,800
I need to talk to you. Come with me.
-Okay, but I just gotta...

486
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,200
Guys, can you give us
a moment, please?

487
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,560
What happened out there?

488
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,480
This prawn wouldn't listen to me,
one really unruly prawn...

489
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,880
and I just had to...
get him in my grasp.

490
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,920
Listen to me, too many
aliens died out there today.

491
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,440
UIO is all over my backside.

492
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,880
Focus! you're not going to
fuck this up for me!

493
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,600
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can!

494
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,000
Hi there!
-Nice to see you again.

495
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,400
Does this mean he's in charge
of this new operation?

496
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,400
-Yes.
-That's nice.

497
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,760
Wikus! Baby are you okay?

498
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,520
Okay, let's cut some cake.

499
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,680
<i>Doctor Smith, please come
to room 405, doctor Smith.</i>

500
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,640
Is it badly infected?
-There's a lot of suppuration.

501
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,640
Also you should know on my right hand
some fingernails were coming loose.

502
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,760
And I had a black fluid coming out
of my nose, and sort of a black vomit.

503
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,000
What is happening
to my arm, doctor?

504
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,200
What is this thing?

505
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,200
Just breathe deeply.
Calm down. Stay calm.

506
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,360
Sir, please call my wife.

507
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,680
<i>Attention all medical containment
evacuate ward 11.</i>

508
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,040
Stop right there, madam.

509
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,000
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?

510
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,280
Let me through!

511
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,680
Wikus! Wikus!
Where are you taking him?

512
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,920
Okay, got him?
Are you ready? -Got him.

513
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,440
Doctor Fester! -Yes?
-I think you should see this.

514
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,560
I found it in his jacket.
You think this is alien?

515
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,480
It's freezing! Fuck!

516
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,960
16 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

517
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,960
Where is this?

518
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,360
What?

519
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,000
What are they doing
to these prawns?

520
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,320
Pain threshold, test one, DBX 7.

521
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,120
That's a strong pain reaction.
That means the nerves have fused.

522
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,680
I mean, it's almost
completely integrated.

523
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,000
Okay, do it.

524
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,040
B5. Testing AMR-B5.

525
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,720
Clear the range.
Now, quickly!

526
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,360
Swing it around.

527
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,760
What are you doing?
-The door is locked.

528
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,640
Can you grip that?
-What is this?

529
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,240
-Put it through.
-Why are you doing this?

530
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,040
-Standby for fire. Standby.
-You want me to shoot that?

531
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,120
Stand back... and fire!

532
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,960
That's good!

533
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,200
It worked!

534
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,720
All right, thanks very much.

535
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,960
Do you know where my wife is?

536
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,920
Do you know if my wife
knows where I am, sir?

537
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,720
Pull! Pull!

538
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
No sir, I will not pull.

539
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,160
What did you say about
your wife? Fuck your wife!

540
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,880
Pull! -I will not pull.

541
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,640
Fire!

542
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,040
B7. -I can pull it.
-He says he can pull it.

543
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,000
I said I could pull it!
You fuckin'...!

544
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,800
B21.

545
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,120
Move, hurry up. Move!

546
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,200
Right, we want him in the center
by the chain. -Get this off me.

547
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,200
Come on! Time, time!

548
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,240
Leave that fucking prawn, man,
I will shoot at pig. I'll shoot, sir!

549
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,480
Listen, I'll shoot at pig again
for you. I'll pull the trigger.

550
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,920
But I'm not shooting at prawn,
you hear me? Untie the fucking gun.

551
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,480
B21 in human hand.
That's good. It worked.

552
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,240
Just untie the gun, sir.
-Stand by.

553
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,960
Listen, you can't use the real guy,
he didn't do anything to you.

554
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,080
I want to try this.
Everybody standing by.

555
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,960
Ready to go?
Three, two, one, go!

556
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,840
Amazing!

557
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,880
All right!
I think that's all we need.

558
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,680
Gentlemen, we are
running out of time.

559
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,800
This is the key stage
in the metamorphosis.

560
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,320
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.

561
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,360
And a problem is,
as the infection spreads,

562
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,360
the transition becomes
permanent and less active.

563
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,120
He's going to turn
into one of them. A prawn!

564
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,200
What happens to him
isn't important.

565
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,160
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.

566
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,640
This body represents
hundreds of millions,

567
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,040
maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology.

568
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,480
There are people out there,
governments, corporations,

569
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,240
who'd kill for this chance.

570
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,880
Will he survive the procedure?
-No, of course not.

571
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,560
We need everything.
Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

572
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,400
The procedure is gonna basically
strip him down to nothing. -Please...

573
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,720
What about next of kin?

574
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,480
Please help me.
Don't let them do it.

575
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,880
I'll handle that.

576
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,400
Okay, I say let's go.
-Good, thank you.

577
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,200
I don't understand.

578
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,600
None of this makes any sense.
He just hurt his arm, dad.

579
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,920
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

580
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,960
Doing their best to save him.

581
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,000
We're starting to harvest
material from the specimen.

582
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,960
We'll start with the soft tissue first.
Cut through the chest cavern.

583
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,760
We need to get the heart out
as quickly as possible.

584
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,200
Once it set the sinuosity,
it just spread.

585
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,040
You know Wikus.
He never was very strong.

586
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,640
I'll go through the chest,
go straight into the heart.

587
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,880
Be quiet, please.
-Fuck you!

588
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,280
Can I see him?

589
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,360
Not a good idea.

590
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,600
Fuck off! Fuck you!

591
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,600
Fuck you!

592
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,880
You need to let go of him now.

593
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,720
It's okay, Tania.
Everything will be okay.

594
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,880
Smith.

595
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,880
When?

596
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,360
Get Koobus.

597
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,600
<i>...Wikus Van De Merwe.</i>

598
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,120
<i>White male, mid thirties.
Is considered highly dangerous.</i>

599
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,320
-Hey baby.
-Wikus, is that you?

600
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,720
-Mrs. Smith?
-How dare you phone us!

601
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,760
What are all these people doing in
my house? -It's none of your business.

602
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,800
I need to speak to Tania
straight away, please. It's my house.

603
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,000
This is my phone that you're
using, mam. I'm fokkin'... what?

604
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,400
He tried calling me.

605
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,400
Anton, it's me! It's me!
Accept the call!

606
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,120
I've been friends with you
for fokkin' 13 years, man!

607
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,920
Fuck off! What are you watching?
Fuck off!

608
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,000
We all thought it was for the best
because he needed help.

609
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,040
A special medical help.

610
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,800
And he wasn't gonna
get that as a fugitive.

611
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,160
He became the most valuable
business artifact on Earth.

612
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,160
He was the only human
who had ever...

613
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,280
successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive.

614
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,360
But his real value was that
he could operate alien weaponry.

615
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,720
Hello.

616
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,480
Can I get some cheese burgers
and one large sauerkraut, please.

617
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,240
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.</i>

618
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,920
<i>A patient has escaped from the
isolation ward and is loose in the city.</i>

619
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,960
<i>Wikus Van De Merwe
was recently apprehended</i>

620
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,320
<i>after prolonged sexual activity
with aliens in District 9.</i>

621
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,680
This is nonsense.
-I have to call my manager.

622
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,240
That is totally untrue.
You are legally obliged to serve me!

623

<i>...is causing bodily disfigurement.</i>

624
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,240

please. Don't listen to them!

627
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,480

This hand is fine!

628
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,280
<i>If you have any information

Stop!

631
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,720
31 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

632
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,680
Hi, this is Tania.
-And Wikus.

633
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,280
We can't come
to the phone right now.

634
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,640
Please leave a message. Bye.
-Bye bye.

635
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,880
<i>Control, there's no sign
of mr Van De Merwe.</i>

636
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,760
The entire world was watching him.

637
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,320
He was on every radio station,
every image on television,

638
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,400
anything you could find
had his face on it.

639
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,360
So he had nowhere else to go.
He ended up hiding in the one place

640
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,000
he knew no one would ever
come looking for him.

641

40 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

Pay now,or nothing.

643
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,200
I pay you next week, I promise.

644
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,240
No money - you get nothing.
Fucking prawn, this isn't charity.

645
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,240
Hello, I'd like to buy
some meat, please.

646
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,360
Hey, a man!

647
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,280
Yes, have you got a hamburger,
or a steak roll?

648
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,920
Does it look like
a hamburger shop?

649
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,240
Which one do you want? Goat?

650
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,080
Come on, come on,
I don't have the whole day.

651
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,480
Is that a cat food there?
-Yeah, yeah, it is.

652
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,960
I'll have some of that, guys.

653
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,240
Fuck, man!

654
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,000
Hello, hello?

655
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,840
Baby is that you? Tania?

656
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,040
God, please let it be you.

657
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,440
Yes, it's me.

658
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,240
I'm so happy you called me, baby.

659
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,680
Wikus, listen to me. -Okay.

660
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,280
I have something to say to you,
and it's not gonna be easy.

661
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,480
No, no, look... listen baby,
before you say anything...

662
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,200
Your father is working against me,
but he's lying to you.

663
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,360
I did not have sex
with one of these...

664
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,680
...fokkin' creatures, man!

665
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,040
I would never have any kind of

666
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,920
pornographic activity
with a fokkin' creature!

667
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:38,120
They say that you're becoming
one of them. I can't do this...

668
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,160
Baby please, don't give up on me.

669
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,480
Don't give up on me baby,
because I can...

670
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,280
I want to see you again, baby.

671
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,280
I'm gonna fix my arm
and I'm gonna see you again,

672
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,240
and I'm gonna kiss you
and I'm gonna hold you again.

673
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,400
I also want you
to hold me again.

674
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,480
Baby?

675
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,080
Baby?

676
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,320
Hey! Hey man!

677
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,840
Okay...

678
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,600
<i>We are on tracking
directly to the location.</i>

679
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,080
<i>Roger that. I'll send you a
couple of choppers for backup.</i>

680
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,600
You!

681
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,280
What do you want?

682
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,080
<i>Come in, control, there is
our target moving to 66.</i>

683
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,720
-You have to go.
-Please, I need your help.

684
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,800
We're gonna play hide and seek.
-Yes! Yes! -No, get back.

685
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,160
You want me to hide? Show me
your favorite hiding place.

686
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,200
Please, just go.
Leave us alone.

687
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,600
No, please, I need to hide.

688
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,480
They wanna kill me.

689
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,280
I just need to hide in here,
sir, for 5 minutes, okay?

690
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,200
What is this?
What are you doing here?

691
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,160
I remember you. -Nothing.
You must hide somewhere else.

692
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,600
Sir... please sir,
you have to help me.

693
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,360
I'm losing blood,
they're trying to kill me.

694
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,120
Only one thing that could
make that happen...

695
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,440
Quick! We have to hide him.

696
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,720
Now you... get down there.

697
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,200
Where's the fluid?
What did you do with it?

698
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,200
-Please!
-You took it...

699
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,200
I don't know what
you're talking about!

700
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,960
...I know you did.
I can see what's happening to you.

701
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,640
Tell me where it is.

702
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,120
Alright, alright.

703
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,480
Was it a black fluid
in a flask container?

704
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,880
Yes, that's it. Yes!

705
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,480
I confiscated it and
the guys at the lab took it.

706
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,480
It will be at the MNU.
MNU has it.

707
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,880
What is this?

708
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,240
-You ruined everything.
-Where is this?

709
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,440
Is that your shack?

710
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,480
This whole thing
is under your shack?

711
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,000
For 20 years you've...
this whole fokking' thing in here?

712
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,640
Jesus, this is very illegal.

713
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,280
I mean, this is a find, you know.
I wish they catch you with this.

714
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,480
Fuel goes in here.

715
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,960
That's enough! Quiet!

716
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,160
Then we fly away.

717
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,560
I said quiet!
We cannot trust him.

718
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,560
What is he saying about the fuel?
Are you trying to start this thing?

719
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,800
Are you little fuckers trying
to start this and get away?

720
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,800
Never mind.

721
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,120
Yeah, you sneaky fokkin' prawns.

722
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,920
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

723
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,760
What? What did you say...
about the fixing?

724
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,200
What do you mean
you could fix me?

725
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,160
Forget it.
It doesn't matter, it's too late.

726
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,360
No, listen! Listen.
Are you saying that you can...

727
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,000
turn this prawn hand
into a human hand?

728
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,280
You can make me human again?

729
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,320
We have medical machines on the
mothership that can fix you. Yes.

730
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,880
We can use this ship
to fly up there.

731
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,920
That's fantastic!
You guys are brilliant!

732
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,000
I always thought that prawns
were intelligent. Let's do it.

733
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,480
I don't have fluid.

734
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,000
I could fix you and I could fly away.
But I don't have fluid.

735
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,280
Right, okay.

736
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,800
All right, I tell you what.
Why don't we...

737
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,760
go risk it some more?
Let's go collect some up.

738
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,600
It took twenty years
to collect that amount.

739
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,640
Fuck, man! Fuck!

740
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,440
Fuck! The only one that exists
is the one I confiscated?

741
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,280
Yes.

742
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,240
It's four stories underground.

743
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,720
Why does he keep looking at me
like that? -He likes you.

744
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,000
We are the same.

745
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,880
We're not the same.
We're not the fokkin' same.

746
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:05,800
There is a way out of this.
We get the fluid back from MNU.

747
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,440
Yeah, and what then?
Then we both die, eh?

748
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,320
Both of us dead.
That's a suicide mission, man.

749
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,720
Can you not fill my head
with that sort of nonsense?

750
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,760
The transformation is accelerating.

751
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,760
You don't have much time.

752
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,160
56 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

753
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,320
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

754
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,960
Hello.

755
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,920
-Wikus?
-Tania! Baby...

756
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,960
-Are you okay?
-Oh God! Thank God...

757
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,920
Where are you?

758
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,040
I'am...

759
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,800
It's not like my father said.
I know he was lying to protect me.

760
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,640
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

761
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,040
Baby I know, but listen to me.

762
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,200
It's all lies, I swear to you.
Everything he said to you is lies.

763
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,160
-I know.
-What? What?

764
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,080
I don't believe him, Wikus.
I just want you back.

765
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,000
I want everything back
the way it was.

766
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,040
That's... baby, that's what I want.

767
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,800
That's great!
That's great news.

768
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,960
I can make it the way it was.
If you take me back.

769
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,240
How? How can we go back?

770
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,920
I have a plan.
I know how to fix it.

771
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,360
I know how to fix myself.

772
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,360
And it will be me.
And we'll be back together.

773
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,840
-You promise me?
-I promise you, baby.

774
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,120
Don't give up on me, okay?

775
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,360
Because I haven't
given up on you. All right?

776
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,600
I won't.

777
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,760
-I love you.
-I love you too.

778
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,040
Tell me you got a fix on him.
-D9.

779
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,920
How many moons
does our planet have?

780
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,320
Seven.

781
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,640
This planet only has one.

782
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:32,360
I can't wait to see our planet.
It's bigger than this one, isn't it?

783
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,600
Enough.

784
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,680
We go home now?

785
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,440
Not home. No.

786
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,520
This is where we must go.

787
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,360
See that tent there?
That might be ours.

788
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,720
I want to go home!

789
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,520
We can't go home.
Not anymore.

790
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,640
Hi, you don't wanna go to the tents,
they are not better.

791
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,960
They're smaller than the shacks.

792
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,800
Actually, more like
a concentration camp.

793
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,800
If I can get you that black fluid,
what happens then?

794
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,600
We go up to the mothership.

795
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,720
And you can start that thing?
-Yes.

796
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,360
Okay, so just to be clear:
this is gonna go back...

797
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,680
This is gonna go back
to human like this.

798
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,240
I can go home
and then you can go home.

799
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,120
You can take your boy,
you can take all the prawns,

800
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,520
if I can get you that fluid, right?

801
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,200
You said it was a suicide mission.
Maybe you were right.

802
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,640
We have no weapons.
They'll shoot us on sight.

803
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,880
Look, look... Christopher...

804
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,000
I know where we can get weapons.

805
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,920
Hi guys. Hello.

806
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,880
I would like to buy
some weapons, please.

807
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,880
How did you do this like that?

808
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,080
A doggie style with the demon.

809
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
I love it!

810
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,840
One brave white man, eh?
Were you wearing a condom?

811
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,640
I need to buy weapons, please.

812
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,120
You and I both know that there
are illegal weapons inside here.

813
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,600
I have money and I would like
to buy some of those...

814
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,840
Thank you sir for your time.
Thank you very much for seeing me.

815
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,040
I would like to buy some weapons.

816
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,880
AK-47, some grenades...
maybe tear gas canisters.

817
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,120
I see you have limpet mines
here aswell, and I..

818
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:23,120
also see you guys have alien
weapons there, which is great!

819
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,000
If I could have one or two of those.

820
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:29,200
I have money, okay?
Now, I'm...

821
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,120
Sir! Please, sir!

822
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,440
I've heard about you.

823
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,400
Where do you have it?
Show me!

824
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,400
Oh, shit!

825
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,320
Come here. Come.

826
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,600
No, no... don't please!

827
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,920
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?

828
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,240
Shut up!

829
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,040
Forget the weapons!
Forget the weapons!

830
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,120
I want the arm. Cut it off.

831
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,400
What is he saying?

832
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,800
I'll show you.

833
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,440
Holy shit!

834
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,160
You tell them to stand down!

835
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,040
You tell them to be quiet!
To back off!

836
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,360
Tell them to put the fokkin'
weapons in the bag!

837
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,120
Give me the fokkin' weapons, man!

838
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,600
Don't you, sir, look at me.

839
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,800
I said don't fokkin' look at me!

840
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,200
How did you get that hand?

841
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,960
Fokkin' hurry up there!

842
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,120
Look at me when I fuckin' speak
to you. What is your secret?

843
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,920
What did you do? Tell me!

844
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,280
I want that fuckin' arm.
What the fuck did you do?

845
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,920
You fuckin' mazungo,
I'm coming for you!

846
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,520
I'm coming for you and
I'm gonna get you!

847
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,240
Drop your fokkin' knife.
Drop your fokkin' knife!

848
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,800
I know Layden,
he's useless to us there.

849
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,120
Would you relax?

850
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,120
For fuck's sakes, my men have
done this a hundred times before.

851
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,480
<i>Maintaining a visual
on the location.</i>

852
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,840
It's gonna be quick.

853
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,000
It's gonna be clean.

854
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,120
Best of all,
it's gonna be quiet.

855
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,440
Van De Merwe hasn't got a clue
what's coming his way.

856
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,640
It's empty!
-Where are they?

857
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,600
Target is gone.
The place is empty.

858
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,400
What do you mean, empty?
Where the fuck is he?

859
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,960
That little shithead has got
no idea what is coming his way.

860
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,440
I'm gonna find him.

861
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,680
There are the guards! At the gate!
Watch the guards at the gate, man!

862
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,400
Move! Get out!

863
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,280
They're going down.
Four stories down.

864
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,280
This is alien weaponry.
Give me a status report.

865
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,840
It's Van De Merwe.
He's on level four.

866
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,480
Switch to live, and
then we're taking him out.

867
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,480
Colonel, we weren't allowed
to use live ammunition.

868
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,120
They want him alive.

869
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,480
Stay here until I call you.
-I understand.

870
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,360
I need to get the door open.

871
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,000
No! I said stay until I call you!

872
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,520
Fuck!

873
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,080
I thought you said
not to kill them?

874
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,760
He shot at me!

875
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,880
Fuck! Get out!
Don't fuckin' look at me!

876
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,480
Get out!
Get the fuck out!

877
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,240
Get out!
Everybody get the fuck out!

878
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,080
Get out! Go!

879
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,960
Move the fuck out! Go!

880
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,080
What is this place?
-Don't worry about that.

881
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,360
What do they do in here?

882
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,040
Check these boxes.

883
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,680
Any type of a box that looks like
it can hold a tube. Just check it out!

884
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,080
These fuckers!

885
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,000
Go, go, go...

886
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,720
Clear.

887
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,000
I got it! I got it!

888
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,800
Chris, I got it. Let's go!

889
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,040
Christopher!

890
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,800
Oh, fuck!

891
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,440
Listen... I promise you,
I didn't know they were doing this.

892
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,360
Until they brought me here
the other day,

893
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,480
I swear to you I did not know
they were doing this to you guys.

894
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,440
But Christopher...
look at me. Listen to me.

895
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,240
We need to leave now. Okay?

896
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,960
The whole of MNU
is gonna come down here.

897
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,640
He's going to destroy us.

898
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,120
We can do this, okay?
We're gonna get out of here...

899
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,120
Fire!

900
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,920
Move, move!

901
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,840
Shoot at the prawn!

902
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,640
Christopher!
What the fuck are you doing?

903
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,840
Think of your boy,
for fuck sake!

904
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,960
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

905
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,600
You're gonna get us killed!
-What do we do now?

906
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,920
I thought you had a way out?

907
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,320
I didn't say anything
about the way out.

908
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,560
I promised you that we'll get in.
We're in! -I have an idea.

909
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,520
-Where are you going?
-Follow me!

910
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,000
What are you doing?
-Making a bomb.

911
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,120
Let's go!

912
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,520
Quick! Get in!

913
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,400
Go! Drive!

914
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,880
Okay!

915
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,840
Okay, hold on!

916
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,600
Fuck!

917
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,520
Reports are coming in of explosion
in downtown Johannesburg.

918
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,000
Well, there was a terrorist attack,

919
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,360
but I can assure you that we
dealt with it. Everything is fine.

920
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,840
Droop it down!
Droop it down! Decline!

921
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,760
They are really
close to us now!

922
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,720
Shit!

923
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,240
Let's go, let's go!

924
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,440
Don't drop that fokkin' thing!

925
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,960
Come on, move!
Get down there!

926
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:57,320
Go down and initiate
the binary commands.

927
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,880
Set it down right now!

928
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,040
When we get up to the mothership,
how long is this gonna take?

929
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,640
-To do what?
-The fixing. To fix me.

930
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,440
It's going to take a bit
longer than I thought.

931
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,640
Okay, that's fine.
How long do you need?

932
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,840
Three years.

933
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,680
Sorry, just go slowly
with the clicks there,

934
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,000
it sounded like you said
"three years", like human years.

935
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,720
Yes. Three years.

936
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,600
What? Three fuckin' years?

937
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,400
I will fix you,

938
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,560
but first I must save my people.

939
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,960
The deal was:
you go home, I get fixed!

940
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:39,680
I will not let my people
be medical experiments!

941
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,760
I'm a fokkin' medical experiment!
You hear me, Christopher?

942
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,280
I'm a fokkin' medical
experiment, man!

943
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,040
I must go home and get help.

944
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,200
I must use all the fluid
to travel quickly.

945
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,160
I'll just stay here, Christopher?
I'll just stay here in this shit.

946
01:12:56,520 --> 01:13:00,040
And I'll see you in three years time?
-I will come back. I promise.

947
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,080
Christopher!

948
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,480
Where the fuck is he?

949
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,720
Hey, you got Wikus
down there, my boy?

950
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,480
-Father?
-No, no, no.

951
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,400
Your daddy needs to stay here
to sort out a few things, alright?

952
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,360
We're gonna go. We're gonna
come back and fetch him, okay?

953
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,360
In here? -In there.
-Goes in here?

954
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,640
How the fuck do you
open this, prawn?

955
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,000
Father.

956
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,080
Show me, you fucker.
You want me to fuckin' kill you?

957
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,160
Is that what you fuckin' want, eh?

958
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,120
Right... let's think this over.

959
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,920
On!

960
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,040
Activate?

961
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,600
My teachers teach only:

962
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,120
One prawn, one bullet.

963
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,320
I can't believe
I get paid to do this.

964
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,360
I love watching you prawns die.

965
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,880
Fuck, man!

966
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,640
Father!

967
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,600
Get out! Get out!

968
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,440
This is remarkable.

969
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,400
It looks like something is
emerging from the ground.

970
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,440
Something is definitely
coming out of the ground.

971
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,720
Okay... steady!

972
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,520
Go sit down,
I can't play with ya now.

973
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,280
Uncle Wikus is flying.

974
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,560
Bug off. Bug off!

975
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,200
Lock the weapon at target!

976
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,840
Fire when locked.

977
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,400
It seems to be drifting towards
the center of the territory.

978
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,120
We have a lock on him. -Fire!

979
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,960
Something is fired upon...
it has been hit!

980
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,360
What the fuck is that?

981
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,160
One of the engines is billowing
smoke, it's out of control.

982
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,920
It's going down, boss. Should I
send the boys to fuck him up?

983
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,920
Now... it hit the ground,
the massive impact,

984
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,920
and it's come to a standstill.

985
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,720
My son!
My son's in there!

986
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,640
Shut the fuck up!
Get this fucker inside.

987
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,920
We're moving out.
Come, let's go, let's go...

988
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,200
Move!

989
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,920
We're banking around now, trying
to get a better view of the ship

990
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,680
which is absolutely wrecked,
waiting for some of the smoke to clear.

991
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,520
Somebody has been
brought out of the vehicle.

992
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,760
It looks like a human being.

993
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,480
We are getting unconfirmed
reports that this might be

994
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,360
Wikus Van De Merwe, a fugitive
that has been on the run

995
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,760
from MNU for the past 3 days.

996
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,480
They are loading him into
a vehicle now, and heading off.

997
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,160
72 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

998
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,800
What the fuck?

999
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,320
Bring him to me.

1000
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,480
Come on! Get back!

1001
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,720
Oh, fuck!

1002
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:13,360
Control, we're taking enemy fire!
We need support. Backup, now!

1003
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,840
Fuck off! Fuck off, man!

1004
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,720
Get you hands off me!
Fuckin' get off me!

1005
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,840
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

1006
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,520
Didn't I tell you...
that I'm gonna get you?

1007
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,520
You came in here and you left
with something that belongs to me.

1008
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,000
Fuck you.

1009
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,480
Fuck you all!

1010
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,160
I told you that
the day will come.

1011
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,960
You've been running
around with my prize.

1012
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:24,000
All I want is to eat that hand
and become like you.

1013
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,800
No! It won't work...

1014
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,600
Once I have that power,
no one will stop me.

1015
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,160
It was your turn...
now it's mine!

1016
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,600
Fighting MNU security forces,
this armed faction is doomed...

1017
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,840
Now I'm gonna eat, my friend.

1018
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,560
We're getting reports claiming that
the alien device is activating...

1019
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,400
You see that prawn
back in the Casper? -Yeah.

1020
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,600
He knows what the fuck
is up with that ship.

1021
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,200
Get that fucker out
and get him talking, now.

1022
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,160
Three contractors are closing in
on the nigerian compound, and...

1023
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,880
Come, alien!

1024
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,400
What's your plan?

1025
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,240
How are you doing it?

1026
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,840
Who's moving that ship?

1027
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,600
All right, that's very clever.

1028
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:35,400
Wait for my command.
Make sure you fuckin' shoot to kill.

1029
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,520
Fuck! Move it! Move it!

1030
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,560
Bring that fucker down!

1031
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:58,400
Hold you fire! Hold your fire
and keep your positions!

1032
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,920
It's Van De Merwe.

1033
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,480
Hey, Dickus!

1034
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,000
I'll come back for prawn,
alright guys?

1035
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,200
Do you hear me, now?
-Run, Wikus!

1036
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,440
-You hear me?
-Run!

1037
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,240
And keep on running,
you fuckin' coward!

1038
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,400
Run! Run!

1039
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,440
Get the air support up,
and get on his fuckin' trail, now!

1040
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,600
It's not gonna work, boss.
He's a tough one.

1041
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,040
He's not gonna talk.
-Then just fuckin' kill him.

1042
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,640
<i>He's not gonna talk.
-Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1043
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,280
Fuck!

1044
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,800
<i>He's a tough one.
He's not gonna talk.</i>

1045
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,000
<i>Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1046
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,440
Hey, c'mon. Get up!
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1047
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,000
-I can't... it's too far.
-It's not too fokkin' far. Get up!

1048
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,640
I'm gonna get you there.
I'm gonna get you to your boy!

1049
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,120
C'mon, stay behind me!

1050
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,720
Go back!

1051
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,200
Run, run, run!

1052
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,520
Arriving at the location now.
We have a clearance to engage.

1053
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:13,000
Prawns are coming,
get down, get down!

1054
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,240
There is no other option.
Knock these fuckers off!

1055
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,040
Come to mommy, come...

1056
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,120
Fuck!

1057
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,120
Shit!

1058
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,280
Are you hurt?

1059
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,520
We can make it.
I was shot in the arm.

1060
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:56,640
We can make it, come on!

1061
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,360
Listen, you go ahead.
You can make it.

1062
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:19,120
I'm gonna just... hold them
off here, and I'll join you soon.

1063
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,840
No, we stick together.
I'm not leaving you here.

1064
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,000
Take your boy and go home.
You have to make it.

1065
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,880
Don't make me go through
all of this and not make it.

1066
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,120
Do you understand?
-I will come back for you.

1067
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,280
Go! Go now before
I change my mind! Go!

1068
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:38,360
Three years. I promise.

1069
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,440
I'm not fuckin' scared of you!

1070
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,840
Quit fuckin' with me!

1071
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,120
You want me?
You want me?

1072
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,920
Is that all you got?

1073
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,760
Is that all you fuckin' got?

1074
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:17,720
Some kind of quite extraordinary
light from the mothership.

1075
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,000
I've never seen anything like it.
It's a beam of light...

1076
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,800
Full scan. Okay.

1077
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,960
Fire!

1078
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:09,760
Get to the vehicle, now! Get going.
-Yes colonel. -Go, go, go!

1079
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,920
Fuck!

1080
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,360
Quit playing with me, Koobus!

1081
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,760
You fucker!

1082
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,600
Go, Chris, go.

1083
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,280
Go home.

1084
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,960
We go home now?

1085
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,960
Yes.

1086
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,520
74 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

1087
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,760
Unbelievable.

1088
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,600
Now I know why everybody
wants a piece of you.

1089
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,640
I can't wait for those
med boys to cut you up.

1090
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,840
But you know what?

1091
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,840
You're not gonna waste
any more of my time.

1092
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,400
You half-breed piece of shit!

1093
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:30,200
I'm gonna just fuckin'
kill you myself.

1094
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:41,440
Stay back, you fuck!
Stay back!

1095
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:45,400
Stay back!

1096
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,400
The people everywhere
across Johannesburg

1097
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:13,600
are flooding the streets and
pouring out of their offices

1098
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,720
and all eyes are pointed up towards
the sky on this momentous day.

1099
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,280
It's the first time, ladies and
gentlemen, in over two decades,

1100
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,440
that the mothership has shown
any sign of movement,

1101
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,240
and people are
tremendously excited.

1102
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:30,400
The city had come
to an absolute standstill.

1103
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:33,760
Everybody wants to know
what's going to happen next.

1104
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:37,400
There's no way of knowing whether
or not Christopher Johnson will return.

1105
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,600
We don't know if
he was simply escaping,

1106
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:42,200
whether he will
effect a rescue plan...

1107
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,240
...and, as the so called
free press says,

1108
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,200
whether or not he will come back
and declare a war on us.

1109
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,520
This is the last known footage
of Wikus Van De Merwe.

1110
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,440
And we can only speculate
as to what has happened to him.

1111
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,640
The more zany conspiracy
theories state that

1112
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:30,320
he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.

1113
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,360
Or by perhaps some
shady government agency

1114
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,240
and he's actually
being held in captivity.

1115
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:39,120
If we knew where he was,
we would try and help him,

1116
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:42,320
and that is the most difficult part,
not knowing where he is.

1117
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:46,640
Wikus, sadly, is gone but
I'm the one who stays behind

1118
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:50,360
with all the questions.
I can't give the answers.

1119
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,680
He died in my mind a long
time ago. And that's that.

1120
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:59,000
Wikus Van Der Merwe is a name
that will become very widely known

1121
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:02,960
because of this pivotal role
that he played in this whole event.

1122
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:06,600
He was an honest man, and he didn't
deserve any of what happened to him.

1123
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:09,960
I mean, I know. I looked into a
computer system and I found stuff.

1124
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:13,200
I mean, the whole data
was there, you know?

1125
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:16,280
They didn't even do
a good job of hiding it.

1126
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:19,760
<i>Fundiswa Mhlanga is
currently awaiting trial</i>

1127
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,920
<i>for exposing MNU's illegal
genetic research program.</i>

1128
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,040
<i>District 9 was demolished</i>

1129
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,240
<i>after the alien resettlement
operation was completed.</i>

1130
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,480
<i>District 10 now houses 2.5 million
aliens and continues to grow...</i>

1131
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:36,800
You guys haven't seen a picture of
my wife. Let me show you my wife.

1132
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,320
She's my special angel.

1133
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:42,280
She even looks like an angel
with veil, you want to see that?

1134
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:45,080
Look, you see,
with the white veil over the...

1135
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:48,800
she even looks like an angel.
Everyone says that his wife is angel,

1136
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:51,960
but this is a real angel that you
see there, on the cameras.

1137
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,160
They won't put that
in the video, I don't think.

1138
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,160
I found this at my front door.

1139
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:04,920
As tho somebody had
just left it there.

1140
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,960
My friends say that
I should throw it away,

1141
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:11,360
cause it's just a piece of rubbish.

1142
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:14,720
That it couldn't possibly
come from him.

1143
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,200
I know it's true.
