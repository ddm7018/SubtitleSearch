1
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:40,583
Life's not fair, is it?

2
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,583
You see I -- well,

3
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,833
I... shall never be King.

4
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,500
And you...

5
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,667
shall never see the light of another day. ... Adieu...

6
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,083
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?

7
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,833
What do you want?

8
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,083
I'm here to announce that King Mufasa is on his way.

9
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:03,833
So you'd better have a good excuse
for missing the ceremony this morning.

10
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,500
Oh now look, Zazu. You've made me lose my lunch.

11
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,500
Hah! You'll lose more than that when
the King gets through with you.

12
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,750
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

13
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:16,500
Ohhh... I quiver with FEAR.

14
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,833
Now Scar, don't look at me that way...

15
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
HELP!!!!

16
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,500
Scar!

17
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,000
Mm-hmm...?

18
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,333
Drop him.

19
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,417
Impeccable timing, your majesty.

20
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:30,667
Eyyccch.

21
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:35,917
Why! If it isn't my big brother descending 
 from on high to mingle with the commoners.

22
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,250
Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.

23
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,250
That was today? Oh, I feel simply awful.

24
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,333
...Must have slipped my mind.

25
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:54,333
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,
as the king's brother,
 you should have been first in line!

26
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,833
Well, I was first in line, ... until the little hairball was born.

27
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:04,250
"That ""hairball"" is my son -and your future king."

28
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,250
Ohh, I shall practice my curtsy.

29
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,417
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

30
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,250
On, no, Mufasa. Perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me.

31
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,750
Is that a challenge?

32
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,417
Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

33
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,833
Pity! Why not?

34
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,500
Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share.

35
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,083
But, when it comes to brute strength ...

36
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:34,417
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.

37
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,917
There's one in every family sire...

38
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:45,333
Two in mine actually. And they always manage to ruin special occasions.

39
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,333
What am I going to do with him?

40
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,417
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

41
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,667
Zazu!

42
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:53,833
And just think! Whenever he gets dirty,

43
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 you could take him out and beat him.

44
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,833
Hmmm... Ah heh heh heh heh heh...

45
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,917
Simba

46
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,583
Hmmm... Ah heh heh heh heh heh.

47
00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:00,000
Dad! Daad!  Come on, Dad, we gotta go, wake up!

48
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,083
Oomph!

49
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,583
Sorry!

50
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,167
Dad? Daad. Dad, ...

51
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,583
Your son.... is awake....

52
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,083
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad...

53
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,250
Before sunrise, he's your son.

54
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,917
 Dad? Daad! Come on, Dad! Daa- Whoa!

55
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,333
You promised!

56
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay, okay. I'm up. I'm up.

57
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,917
Yeah!

58
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:45,500
Look Simba. Everything the light touches is our kingdom.

59
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,667
Wow.

60
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:52,083
A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun.

61
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:56,667
One day Simba, the sun will set on my time here

62
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,667
and will rise with you as the new king.

63
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,750
And this'll all be mine?

64
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,583
Everything.

65
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:07,833
Everything the light touches...What about that shadowy place?

66
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:12,000
"That's beyond our borders; you must never go there, Simba."

67
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,500
But I thought a king can do whatever he wants.

68
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,417
Oh, there's more to being king than-- getting your way all the time.

69
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,417
There's more?

70
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,417
Simba.

71
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:27,000
Everything you see exists together, in a delicate balance.

72
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,583
As king, you need to understand that balance,

73
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:35,000
and respect all the creatures
from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.

74
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,250
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

75
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

76
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,583
When we die,our bodies become the grass.

77
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,250
And the antelope eat the grass.

78
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:51,250
And so, we are all connected in the great Circle of Life.

79
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,250
Good morning, sire!

80
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,167
Good morning, Zazu.

81
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,000
Checking in... with the morning report.

82
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,083
Fire away.

83
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,833
Well! The buzz from the bees is that 
the leopards are in a bit of a spot ...

84
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,833
Oh, really?

85
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,500
And the baboons are going ape over this.
What are you doing, son?
- What are you doing, son?

86
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,417
- Of course, the giraffes are acting like they're above it all....
- Pouncing.

87
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
- Let an old pro show you how it's done.
- The tick birds are pecking on the elephants.

88
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,333
I told the elephants to forget it, but they can't ...

89
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,167
Zazu, would you turn around?

90
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,250
Yes, sire.The Cheetahs are hard up, but as I always say ...

91
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,250
Stay low to the ground.

92
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,583
Cheetahs never prosper...

93
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,083
Okay, stay low to the ground, right yeah ...

94
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,833
What's going on?
A pouncing lesson.

95
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,750
Oh very good. Pouncing.

96
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,333
Pouncing!?!
Oh no, sire, you can't be serious ...

97
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,333
Oh, ... this is so humiliating.

98
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,333
Try not to make a sound.

99
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:36,000
What are you telling him Mufasa? Mufasa? ...Simba?

100
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:41,917
Ha ha ha ha ha. That's very good. Ha ha ha...

101
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,917
Zazu.
Yes?

102
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,833
Sir. News from the underground.

103
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,500
Now, this time--

104
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,750
Sire! Hyenas!! In the Pride Lands!

105
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,917
Zazu, take Simba home.

106
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,083
Oh Dad, can't I come?

107
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,917
No, son.

108
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,750
I never get to go anywhere.

109
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,583
"Oh young master, one day you will be king;"

110
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,167
then you can chase those slobbering, mangy, 
stupid poachers from dawn until dusk.

111
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,833
Hey Uncle Scar, guess what!

112
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,417
I despise guessing games.

113
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,833
I'm going to be king of Pride Rock.

114
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:23,833
Oh goodee.

115
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:28,667
My Dad just showed me the whole kingdom, 
and I'm going to rule it all. Heh heh.

116
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,833
Yes. Well... forgive me for not leaping for joy.... 
Bad back, you know.

117
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,417
Hey, Uncle Scar? When I'm king, what will that make you?

118
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,583
A monkey's uncle.

119
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,167
Heh heh. You're so weird.

120
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:50,333
You have no idea. ...
So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?

121
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,500
Everything.

122
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,667
He didn't show you what's beyond
 that rise at the northern border...?

123
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,500
Well, no... he said I can't go there.

124
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
And he's absolutely right!

125
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,333
It's far too dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there.

126
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, I'm brave! What's out th--

127
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,667
"No, I'm sorry Simba; I just can't tell you."

128
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,417
Why not?

129
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,583
"Simba, Simba; I'm only looking out for
 the well-being of my favorite nephew."

130
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,750
"Yeah, right; I'm your only nephew."

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,500
All the more reason for me to be protective...

132
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,417
An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince ... Oops!

133
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:26,250
An elephant what? Whoa!

134
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,917
Oh dear, I've said too much....

135
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,250
Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later, 

136
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,167
you being so clever and all....

137
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:40,833
Oh, just do me one favor-- 
Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.

138
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,333
No problem.

139
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:47,417
There's a good lad. You run along now and have fun.

140
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:51,667
And remember... it's our little secret.

141
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:01,583
Hey, Nala.

142
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,500
Hi, Simba.

143
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,583
Come on. I just heard about this great place.

144
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,500
Simba! I'm kind of in the middle of a bath.

145
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,583
And it's time for yours.

146
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:14,333
Mom! ... Mom. You're messing up my mane.

147
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:19,083
"Okay, okay; I'm clean. Can we go now?"

148
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,917
So where are we going? It better not be anyplace dumb.

149
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,750
No. It's really cool.

150
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,083
"So where is this ""really cool"" place?"

151
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,083
Oh.... uh ... around the water hole.

152
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,417
The water hole?! What's so great about the water hole?

153
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,583
I'll show you when we get there.

154
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,833
Oh....  Uh.... Mom, can I go with Simba?

155
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,250
Hmm... What do you think, Sarabi?

156
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:41,833
Well...

157
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Pleeeease?

158
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,750
It's all right with me....
 All right!

159
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,583
...As long as Zazu goes with you.

160
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,500
No! Not Zazu.

161
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:53,583
Step lively. The sooner we get to the water hole, the sooner we can leave.

162
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,833
So where're we really going?

163
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,917
An elephant graveyard.

164
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,083
Wow!

165
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,917
Shhh! Zazu.

166
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,917
Right. So how are we gonna ditch the dodo?

167
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,750
Oh I know how we can--

168
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,750
Oh, just look at you two. 
Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savannah.

169
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:14,000
Your parents will be thrilled... 
what with your being betrothed and all.

170
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,833
 Be-what?

171
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Betrothed. Intended. Affianced.

172
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,917
Meaning...?

173
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,667
One day you two are going to be married!

174
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,667
Yuck!
 Ewww!

175
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,750
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

176
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,750
Yeah. It'd be too weird.

177
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,917
Well, sorry to bust your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice. It's a tradition...

178
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,250
...going back generations.

179
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,833
Well when I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.

180
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,167
Not so long as I'm around.

181
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,167
Well in that case, you're fired.

182
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,333
Hmmm.... Nice try, but only the king can do that.

183
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,333
Well, He's the future king.

184
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,583
Yeah.So you have to do what I tell you.

185
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:52,083
Not yet I don't. And with an attitude like that,

186
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,667
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be a pretty pathetic king indeed.

187
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,917
Hmph. Not the way I see it.

188
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:02,250
I'm gonna be a mighty king. So enemies beware!

189
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:06,750
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts...  With quite so little hair

190
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,500
I'm gonna be the mane event

191
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,750
Like no king was before

192
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,917
I'm brushing up on looking down

193
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm working on my ROAR!!

194
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,667
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing

195
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:26,333
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

196
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,250
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think....

197
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,167
No one saying do this

198
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,333
No one saying be there

199
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,667
No one saying stop that

200
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,917
No one saying see here

201
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,500
Free to run around all day

202
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,917
Free to do it all my way!

203
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:56,167
I think it's time that you and I. Arranged a heart to heart

204
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:01,167
Kings don't need advice

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From little hornbills for a start 

206
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,167
If this is where the monarchy is headed

207
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,000
Count me out!

208
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:11,500
Out of service, out of Africa I wouldn't hang about ... aaagh!

209
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,667
This child is getting wildly out of wing

210
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:19,833
Oh I just can't wait to be king!

211
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,417
Everybody look left

212
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:38,333
Everybody look right

213
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,833
Everywhere you look I'm

214
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,417
Standing in the spotlight

215
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,000
Let every creature go for broke and sing

216
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:52,333
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing

217
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,417
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

218
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,500
Oh I just can't wait to be king!

219
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh I just can't wait to be king!

220
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:17,250
Oh I just can't waaaaaait ... to be kiiiiiiiiiing!

221
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:27,833
I beg your pardon, madam, but ... GET OFF!... Simba? Nala?

222
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,167
All right, it worked!

223
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,917
We lost 'im.

224
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,417
I ... am a genius.

225
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,167
Hey, Genius, it was my idea.

226
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,500
Yeah, but I pulled it off.
 With me!

227
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,167
Oh yeah?... Rrarr!!

228
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,917
Ha. Pinned ya.

229
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,667
Hey, lemme up.

230
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,167
Pinned ya again.

231
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,083
This is it.... We made it.

232
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,750
Whoa!

233
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,417
It's really creepy.

234
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Yeah... isn't it great?

235
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,750
We could get in big trouble.

236
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,833
I know, huh.

237
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,583
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

238
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,750
There's only one way to know. Come on. Let's go check it out.

239
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,667
The only checking out you will do will be to check out of here.

240
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,333
Aw, man.

241
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,667
We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands.

242
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,667
Huh. Look, banana beak is scared. Heh.

243
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,000
That's Mister Banana Beak to you, fuzzy.

244
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,000
And right now we are all in very real danger.

245
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:56,000
Danger? Hah! I walk on the wild side.
I laugh in the face of danger. Ha ha ha ha!

246
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,417
Well, well, well, Banzai. What have we got here?

247
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,000
Hmm. I don't know Shenzi. Uh... What do you think, Ed?

248
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,083
Yeah, just what I was thinking. A trio of trespassers!!

249
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,333
And quite by accident, let me assure you.

250
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,917
A simple navigational error. Eh heh heh...

251
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:26,917
Whoa, whoa, wait wait wait.... I know you.
 You're Mufasa's little stooge.

252
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,667
I, madam, am the king's majordomo.

253
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,167
And that would make you...?

254
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,417
The future king.

255
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Do you know what we do to kings who step out of their kingdom?

256
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,333
Puh. You can't do anything to me.

257
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,417
Uhh.... Technically, they can. We are on their land.

258
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,333
But Zazu, you told me they're nothing 
but slobbering mangy stupid poachers.

259
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,833
Ix-nay on the oopid-stay...

260
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,083
"Who you callin' ""oopid-stay?!?"""

261
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,083
My, my, my. Look at the sun. It's time to go!

262
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,083
What's the hurry?  We'd love you to stick around for dinner.

263
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,583
Yeaaaah! We could have whatever's ... lion around! 
Get it? Lion around!

264
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,917
Oh wait, wait, wait. I got one, I got one.

265
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,750
Make mine a cub sandwich. Whatcha think?

266
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,417
What? Ed? What is it?

267
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,833
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

268
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,833
No. Why?

269
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,917
'Cause there it goes!!

270
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,250
Did we lose 'em?

271
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,417
I think so.... Where's Zazu?

272
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,833
The little Majordomo bird hippity-hopped 
all the way to the birdie-boiler.

273
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,250
Oh no.... Not the birdie boiler! Aaaaaaaa...!

274
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,750
Hey! Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?

275
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,250
Like ... you?
 Oops!

276
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,417
Boo!

277
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,167
Simba!

278
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,417
Aaaaiee!

279
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,250
Here kitty, kitty, kitty.

280
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,583
Oo-hoo... That was it? Hah. Do it again.... come on.

281
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,583
Huh?!

282
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,083
Oh, Please, please. Uncle. Uncle.

283
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,833
Ow. Ow. Ow.
 Silence!

284
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,750
Oh, we're gonna shut up right now.
Calm down. We're really sorry.

285
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,083
If you ever come near my son again...

286
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,833
Oh this is ... this is your son?!?

287
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,667
Oh your son??
 Did you know that?

288
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,000
No.... Me? I-I-I didn't know it. No. Did you?

289
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,083
No! Of course not.
 No! Ed?

290
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Toodles!

291
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,833
Dad, I ..
You deliberately disobeyed me.

292
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,000
Dad, I'm.... I'm sorry.

293
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,750
Let's go home.

294
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,917
I thought you were very brave.

295
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,750
Zazu?

296
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,000
Yes, sire?

297
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,917
Take Nala home. I've got to teach my son a lesson.

298
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,417
Come, Nala. Simba... Good luck.

299
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,750
Simba!

300
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,833
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

301
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,667
I know.

302
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,917
You could have been killed. You deliberately disobeyed me.

303
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,083
 And what's worse,- you put Nala in danger!

304
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,250
I was just trying to be brave like you.

305
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,833
I'm only brave when I have to be.

306
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:56,750
Simba ... being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

307
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,333
 But you're not scared of anything.

308
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I was today.

309
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:04,083
You were?

310
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:06,083
Yes ... I thought I might lose you.

311
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:10,083
Oh. I guess even kings get scared, huh?

312
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Mm-hmm.

313
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,500
But you know what?
 What?

314
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,667
I think those hyenas were even scareder.

315
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,417
Cause nobody messes with your dad.  Come here, you.

316
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:25,417
Oh no, no ... Aaagh! Errrggh! ...

317
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh, come here... Hah! Gotcha!

318
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,417
Dad?
Hmm?

319
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:40,833
We're pals, right?
Right.

320
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,833
And we'll always be together, right?

321
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:51,500
Simba, ... Let me tell you something that my father told me ... Look at the stars.

322
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,250
The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars.

323
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,333
Really?

324
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:03,167
Yes ... So whenever you feel alone,

325
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:07,333
just remember that those kings will always be there to guide you

326
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,583
... And so will I.

327
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,917
Man that lousy Mufasa! I won't be able to sit for a week.

328
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,417
It's not funny, Ed.

329
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,333
Hey, shut up!

330
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,583
Will you knock it off!

331
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,083
Well, he started it.

332
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,083
Look at you guys. No wonder we're dangling at the bottom of the food chain.

333
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,083
Man, I hate dangling.

334
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:48,667
Shyeah?  You know, if it weren't for those lions, we'd be runnin' the joint.

335
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,917
Yeah. Man, I hate lions.

336
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,583
So pushy.   And hairy.    And stinky.

337
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,000
And man are they ...

338
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,667
Uuug-LEE!

339
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,917
Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.

340
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:05,000
Ohh. Oh Scar, it's just you.

341
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,917
We were afraid it was somebody important.

342
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,583
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

343
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,667
Yeah.
I see.

344
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:12,667
Now that's power.

345
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,750
Tell me about it. I just hear that name and I shudder.

346
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,000
Mufasa.
 Ooooh. ... Do it again.
Mufasa.

347
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:19,667
Ooooh.
Mufasa. Mufasa! Mufasa!

348
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,667
Oooh! It tingles me.

349
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:24,750
I'm surrounded by idiots.

350
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,917
Not you Scar, I mean, you're one of us. I mean, you're our pal.

351
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,417
Charmed.

352
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:33,500
Ohh, I like that. He's not king, but he's still so proper.

353
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,750
Yeah. Hey, hey hey. Did ya bring us anything to eat,

354
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,000
Scar, old buddy, old pal? Huh? Did-ya-did-ya-did-ya?

355
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,583
 I don't think you really deserve this.

356
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,250
 I practically gift wrapped those cubs for you.

357
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:46,333
And you couldn't even dispose of them.

358
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:53,667
Well, ya know
it wasn't exactly like they was alone, Scar.

359
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,583
Yeah. What are we supposed to do?... Kill Mufasa?

360
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,833
Precisely.

361
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,000
I know that your powers of retention

362
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,500
Are as wet as a warthog's backside

363
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,750
But thick as you are, pay attention

364
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:28,083
My words are a matter of pride

365
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:32,333
It's clear from your vacant expressions

366
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,417
The lights are not all on upstairs

367
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:39,750
But we're talking kings and successions

368
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:42,917
Even you can't be caught unawares

369
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:46,917
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime

370
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:51,083
Be prepared for sensational news

371
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:54,167
A shining new era

372
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:56,417
Is tiptoeing nearer

373
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,583
And where do we feature?

374
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,417
Just listen to teacher

375
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,417
I know it sounds sordid

376
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,333
But you'll be rewarded

377
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,333
When at last I am given my dues!

378
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:10,417
And injustice deliciously squared

379
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:14,583
Be prepared!

380
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:18,083
Yeah, be prepared.  Yeah-heh.  We'll be prepared, heh ... For what?

381
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,250
For the death of the king.

382
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,750
Why? Is he sick?

383
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,917
No fool, we're going to kill him. And Simba too.

384
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Great idea! Who needs a king?

385
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
No king! No king! la--la-la--la-laa-laa!

386
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
IDIOTS! There will be a king!

387
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Hey, but you said, uh...

388
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:38,667
I WILL BE KING! Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!

389
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,250
Yaay! All right! Long live the king!

390
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,667
Long live the king! Long live the king!

391
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,917
It's great that we'll soon be connected.

392
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,750
With a king who'll be all-time adored.

393
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:58,250
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected

394
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,917
To take certain duties on board

395
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:06,083
The future is littered with prizes

396
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,500
And though I'm the main addressee

397
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,500
The point that I must emphasize is

398
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:17,750
You won't get a sniff without me!

399
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:21,833
So prepare for the coup of the century

400
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,083
Be prepared for the murkiest scam

401
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,083
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning

402
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:31,417
Decades of denial

403
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:35,167
Is simply why I'll  be king undisputed

404
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,417
Respected, saluted

405
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,750
And seen for the wonder I am

406
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:44,917
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared

407
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:49,083
Be prepared!

408
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,167
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared

409
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:58,750
Be prepared!

410
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:09,583


411
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:14,417
Now you wait here. Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.

412
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,667
Ooooh.  What is it?

413
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,583
If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it?

414
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:21,833
If you tell me, I'll still act surprised.

415
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:25,000
Ho ho ho
You are such a naughty boy!

416
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,000
Come on, Uncle Scar.

417
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,000
This is just for you and your daddy

418
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:34,333
You know, a sort of father-son ... thing....

419
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Well! I'd better go get him.

420
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,667
I'll go with you.

421
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,333
No! Heh heh heh. No. Just ... stay on this rock.

422
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:49,333
You wouldn't want to end up in another mess 
like you did with the hyenas...

423
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,917
You know about that?

424
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,083
Simba, everybody knows about that.

425
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,917
Really?

426
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,500
Oh, yes. Lucky Daddy was there to save you, eh?

427
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:04,917
Oh, and just between us, you might
 want to work on that little roar of yours, hmm?

428
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,250
Oh, okay ...

429
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,917
Hey, Uncle Scar? ...Will I like the surprise?

430
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,583
Simba, it's to DIE for.

431
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,667
Shut up.

432
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,167
I can't help it. I'm so hungry ...

433
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,250
I gotta have a wildebeest!

434
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,333
Stay put.

435
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,333
Well can't I just pick off one of the little sick ones?

436
00:31:50,417 --> 00:31:52,417
No! We wait for the signal from Scar.

437
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:57,833
There he is
Let's go.

438
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,750
Little roar. Puh!

439
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,750
Rarrr!

440
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,417
Rrrraowr-nh.

441
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
RAOWR!!

442
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:05,833
"Oh look, sire; The herd is on the move.
 Odd...."

443
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:11,083
Mufasa. Quick. Stampede. In the gorge. Simba's down there!

444
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,083
Simba?

445
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,500
Zazu!
Help me!

446
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,583
Your father is on the way!  Hold on!

447
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,583
Hurry!

448
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,750
There! There! On that tree!

449
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,750
Hold on, Simba!!

450
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,333
Ahhhh!!!

451
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:56,500
Oh, Scar, this is awful!  What'll we do what'll we do?!

452
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,583
Hah ... I'll go back for help, that's what
 I'll do, I'll go back for he-- oomph!

453
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:05,250
Scar! ... Broth--  Brother ... Help me!

454
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:16,167
Long  live  the  king!

455
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,083
Aaaaaaahh!

456
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,750
NOOOOOOOO!

457
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,583
Daaad!!

458
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,833
Dad?

459
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:37,000
Dad? ...Dad, come on. You gotta get up.

460
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,667
Dad.We gotta go home.

461
00:36:52,917 --> 00:36:55,833
HEEEEELP!

462
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:04,167
Somebody! Anybody... help.

463
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:39,167
Simba. ... What have you done?

464
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:44,917
There were wilde beest and he tried to save me

465
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:47,833
It was an accident, I didn't mean for it to happen.

466
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:50,583
Of course, of course, you didn't.

467
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:58,500
No one ever means for these things to happen.... But the king is dead.

468
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,750
And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive.

469
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,917
Oh!  What will your mother think?

470
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What am I gonna do?

471
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:19,333
Run away, Simba.... Run....  Run away, and never return.

472
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:28,167
 Kill him.

473
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,250
Whoa!!

474
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,500
Yeooow!

475
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,333
Hey-- There he goes! There he goes!

476
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:26,583
So go get 'im.

477
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:31,083
There ain't no way I'm going in there. What you want me
 to come out looking like you? Cactus Butt?

478
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
But we gotta finish the job.

479
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:39,417
Well, he's as good as dead out there anyway. 
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

480
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Yeah! you hear that?  If you ever come back, we'll kill ya!

481
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:59,167
"Mufasa's death was a terrible tragedy; but to lose Simba ..."

482
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:02,750
who had barely begun to live....

483
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,917
For me, it is a deep personal loss.

484
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,500
And so it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne.

485
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:18,417
Yet, out of the ashes of this tragedy,
 we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era

486
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:26,250
in which lion and hyena come together, 
in a great and glorious future.

487
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:16,083
Heeyyyaaaahh!! Get out!  Get out!  Get outta here!!!!  Whoo!

488
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,500
I love it! Bowling for buzzards!

489
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:22,583
Gets 'em every time.

490
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:29,000
Uh-oh. Hey Timon. You better come look. 
I think it's still alive.

491
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,750
Yeewgh!...

492
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:36,583
 All righty, what have we got here?

493
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:44,167
Jeez, it's a lion! Run Pumbaa! Move it!

494
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:48,417
Hey, Timon. It's just a little lion. Look at him.

495
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:52,917
He's so cute, and all alone! Can we keep him?

496
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:57,917
Pumbaa, are you nuts?!  We're talking about a lion. 
 Lions eat guys like us.

497
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,750
But he's so little.

498
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,417
He's gonna get bigger.

499
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,250
Maybe he'll be on our side.

500
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:06,583
A--Huh! That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. Maybe he'll b--

501
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,667
Hey, I got it! What if he's on our side?

502
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,917
You know, having a lion around might not be such a bad idea.

503
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,750
So we keeping 'im?

504
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,667
Pthpt. Of course. Who's the brains in this outfit?

505
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,167
Uhhh....

506
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:22,083
My point exactly. Jeez, I'm fried. 
Let's get out of here and find some shade.

507
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,250
You okay, kid?

508
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,417
I guess so.

509
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,000
You nearly died.
I saved you.

510
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,917
Well, uh, Pumbaa helped...a little.

511
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,083
Thanks for your help.

512
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,083
Hey, where you going?

513
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:44,917
Nowhere.

514
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,750
Gee. He looks blue.

515
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,417
I'd say brownish-gold.

516
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,333
No, no, no, no. I mean he's depressed.

517
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,250
Kid, what's eatin' ya?

518
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:57,083
Nothing-- he's at the top of the food chain!

519
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:01,333
The food cha-haain! Ah heh-- Ahem.

520
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,083
So, where you from?

521
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,667
Who cares? I can't go back.

522
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:11,250
"Ahh. You're an outcast! That's great; so are we!"

523
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:13,167
What'cha do, kid?

524
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,167
Something terrible. But I don't wanna talk about it.

525
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:17,417
Good. We don't wanna hear about it.

526
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,083
Come on Timon. Anything we can do?

527
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:22,083
Not unless you can change the past.

528
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:27,667
"You know, kid, in times like this my buddy Timon here says 
""You got to put your behind in your past."""

529
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:30,083
No. No. No.
I mean...

530
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,583
"Amateur. Lie down before you hurt yourself.
It's ""You got to put your past behind you."""

531
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:40,333
Look, kid. Bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?

532
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,083
Right.

533
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:46,667
Wrong!  When the world turns its back on you, 
you turn your back on the world!

534
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,667
Well, that's not what I was taught.

535
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:54,583
Then maybe you need a new lesson. 
Repeat after me. Hakuna Matata.

536
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,083
What?

537
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:59,417
Ha-ku-na Ma-ta-ta. It means no worries.

538
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:04,583
Hakuna Matata! 
 What a wonderful phrase

539
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:10,750
Hakuna Matata! 
 Ain't no passing craze

540
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:16,500
It means no worries for the rest of your days

541
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:22,500
It's our problem-free philosophy

542
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,417
Hakuna Matata!

543
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,833
Hakuna Matata?

544
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,917
Yeah, it's our motto.

545
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,583
What's a motto?

546
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:35,000
Nothing! What's a motto with you? Ah haah haah hah hah...

547
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:38,333
You know, kid-- these two words will solve all your problems.

548
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:42,667
That's right! Take Pumbaa for example.

549
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,250
Why, when he was a young wart-hog

550
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,750
When I was a young wart hooog!

551
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,750
Very nice.
 Thanks!

552
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:53,083
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal

553
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,250
He could clear the Savannah after every meal

554
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:58,500
I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned

555
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:05,083
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind

556
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:09,750
And oh, the shame
He was ashamed

557
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,667
Thoughta changin' my name
Oh, what's in a name

558
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,500
And I got downhearted
How did you feel

559
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,417
Ev'rytime that I... 

560
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,250
Hey, Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!

561
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh.  Sorry.

562
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:24,083
Hakuna Matata! 
What a wonderful phrase

563
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,750
Hakuna Matata! 
Ain't no passing craze

564
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:34,667
It means no worries 
For the rest of your days

565
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah, sing it, kid!

566
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,167
It's our problem-free philosophy.

567
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:44,250
Hakuna Matata!

568
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:48,750
Welcome to our humble home.

569
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:51,083
You live here?
We live wherever we want.

570
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Yep. Home is where your rump rests. Heh!

571
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,667
It's beautiful.

572
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:58,333
I'm starved!

573
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,833
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.

574
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,333
Eeeahhah. We're fresh out of zebra.

575
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:05,000
- Any antelope?
- Na ah.

576
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,333
- Hippo?
- No

577
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:09,167
Listen kid, if want to live with us, you have to eat like us

578
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:12,250
Hey, this looks like a good spot to rustle up some grub

579
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:16,250
- What's that?
A grub, what's it look like?

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


581
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,167
Ooh, Gross!

582
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,833
It tastes like chicken

583
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:25,000
Slimy yet satisfying!

584
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:31,917
These are rare delicacies. Hmm. Piquant with a very pleasant

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
crunch.

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


588
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,500
You'll learn to love them!

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


590
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,500
I'm telling you kid, this is the great life.

591
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,333
No rules, no responsibility.

592
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:44,167
ooh, the little cream filled kind... and best of all, no worries! Well kid!

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


595
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:48,667
Oh, well...
Hakuna Matata!

596
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,667
Slimy, yet satisfying.

597
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,667
That's it!

598
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,167
Hakuna Matata

599
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:20,167
It means no worries
For the rest of your days

600
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:26,083
It's our problem-free philosophy

601
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,417
Hakuna Matata!

602
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,333
Nobody knows
The trouble I see...

603
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:16,167
Nobody knows
My sorrow...

604
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:21,167
Oh Zazu, do lighten up.
 Sing something with a little bounce in it.

605
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:25,333
It's a small world after all

606
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,167
No! No. Anything but that!

607
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:33,083
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts

608
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:37,000
There they are a-standing in a row.

609
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Big ones, small ones, some as big as your head

610
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Oh I would never have had to do this for Mufasa.

611
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:46,083
 What? What did you say?

612
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,000
Oh, nothing!

613
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:52,250
You know the law: Never, ever mention that name in my presence.
 I ... am ... the king!

614
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,333
Yes, sire. You are the king. I, I,  Well,

615
00:48:55,667 --> 00:49:00,250
Well I only mentioned it to illustrate the differences
 in your royal managerial approaches.

616
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,167
Hey, Boss!

617
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:04,500
Oh, What is it this time?

618
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,583
We got a bone to pick with you.

619
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:09,167
I'll handle this. Scar, there's no food, no water.

620
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:12,583
Yeah, it's dinner time, and we ain't got no stinkin' entrees.

621
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:16,000
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting

622
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:18,167
Yeah, but they won't go hunt.

623
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,083
Oh, eat Zazu.

624
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:24,667
Oh, you wouldn't want me. I'd be so tough and gamey and- eewwgh!

625
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:27,917
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous! 
All you need is a little garnish.

626
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I thought things were bad under Mufasa...

627
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,750
 What did you say?

628
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,333
I said Muf--

629
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:35,333
"I said, uh ... ""Qué pasa?"""

630
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:37,667
Good. Now get out.

631
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,250
Mm, yeah, but-- we're still hungry.

632
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:42,833
Out!

633
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,333


634
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,250
Whoah. Nice one, Simba.

635
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,833
Thanks. Man, I'm stuffed.

636
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:56,917
Me too. I ate like a pig!

637
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:59,917
Pumbaa-- you are a pig.

638
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:02,917
Oh. Right.

639
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:16,083
Timon?
Yeah?

640
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:19,417
Ever wonder what those sparkly dots are up there?

641
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:22,750
"Pumbaa. I don't wonder; I know."

642
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,500
Oh! ...What are they?

643
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:32,000
They're fireflies. Fireflies that uh, got stuck up
 on that big, bluish-black, thing.

644
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:40,250
Oh. Gee. I always thought that they were
 balls of gas burning billions of miles away.

645
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,500
Pumbaa, wit' you, everything's gas.

646
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Simba, what do you think?

647
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,250
Well, I don't know

648
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:52,167
Aw come on. Give, give, give ..

649
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,083
Well, come on, Simba, we told you ours... pleeeease?

650
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:03,500
Well, somebody once told me that the great kings
 of the past are up there watching over us.

651
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:09,583
Really?
You mean a bunch of royal dead guys are watching us?Pbbb.

652
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:18,333
Who told you something like that? What mook made that up?

653
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,500
Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?

654
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,167
Ah, you're killing me, Simba.

655
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:36,333
Was it something I said?

656
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,417


657
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:33,250
Simba? He's- he's alive? He he- He's alive!!

658
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:40,167


659
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,083
It is time!

660
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,250
Ohi'mbube

661
00:52:57,667 --> 00:52:59,417
Ohi'mbube

662
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,500
In the jungle

663
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,500
The mighty jungle

664
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:06,750
The lion sleeps tonight.

665
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,833
In the jungle

666
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,167
The mighty jungle

667
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,250
The lion sleeps to--

668
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,250
I can't hear ya, buddy, back me up!

669
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:20,917
A-weee-ee-ee-ee aa-Pum-ba-bum-ba-waaay...

670
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
A-Pumbaa? Pumbaa?

671
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:26,417


672
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,250
Timon?

673
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
HYEEEEAAAHHH!!!!!

674
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:08,083
Pumbaa?

675
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,750
Pumbaa? What's going on?

676
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:18,000
SHE'S GONNA EAT ME!!

677
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:20,583
Huh?

678
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:25,333
Whoah!! ... Jeez! Why do I always have to save your AAAAAA!!

679
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:33,083
"Don't worry, buddy; I'm here for you. Everything's gonna be okay."

680
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:39,833
Get her! Bite her head! Go for the jugular. The jugular!

681
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,833
See, I told you he'd come in handy.

682
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:45,833


683
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:47,917
Nala?

684
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:53,917
Is it really you?

685
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,833
Who are you?

686
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:57,750
It's me. Simba.

687
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:03,167
Simba?  Whoah!!!

688
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:07,583
Well how did you.. where did you come from ... it's great to see you..

689
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,500
Aaaah! how did you... who... wow... this is cool... it's great to see you.

690
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,750
Hey, what's goin' on here?

691
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,667
What are you doing here?

692
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,583
"What do you mean, 
""What am I doing here?"" What are you doing here?"

693
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:19,167
HEY!! WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?!?

694
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,917
"Timon, this is Nala; she's my best friend!"

695
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:23,667
Friend?!?

696
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,417
Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa! Come over here.

697
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,583
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.

698
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:31,583
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

699
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:33,583
The pleasure's all mine.

700
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:36,583
How do you do.. Whoa! Whoa. Time out... Let me get this straight.

701
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,750
You know her. She knows you. But she wants to eat him.

702
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,333
And, everybody's okay with this? 

703
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,583
DID I MISS SOMETHING?!

704
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,333
Relax, Timon.

705
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:53,250
Wait 'til everybody finds out you've been here all this time.
 And your mother what will she think?

706
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:57,333
She doesn't have to know. Nobody has to know.

707
00:55:57,083 --> 00:55:59,500
Well, of course they do. Everyone thinks you're dead.

708
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,333
They do?

709
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:03,833
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.

710
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,500
He did? What else did he tell you?

711
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:12,417
What else matters? You're alive.  And that means... you're the king!

712
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:17,833
King? Pbbb. Lady, have you got your lions crossed.

713
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:22,167
King? Your Majesty! I gravel at your feet.

714
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:25,083
Stop it.

715
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:29,917
"It's not ""gravel,"" it's ""grovel."" And don't; he's not the king. Are ya?"

716
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:32,083
No.
Simba!

717
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:36,333
No, I'm not the king. Maybe I was gonna be. 
But, that was a long time ago.

718
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:40,000
Let me get this straight. You're the king?  
And you never told us?

719
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,250
Look, I'm still the same guy.

720
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,250
But with power!

721
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,833
Could you guys ... excuse us for a few minutes?

722
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:51,000
Hey, whatever she has to say, she can say in front of us. Right, Simba?

723
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,917
Hmm.... Maybe you'd better go .

724
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,583
It starts. You think you know a guy.....

725
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:05,417
Timon and Pumbaa. You learn to love 'em.

726
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:12,583
What?  What is it?

727
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,833
It's like you're back from the dead.

728
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,917
You don't know how much this will mean to everyone.

729
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,583
What it means to me.

730
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,333
" Hey; it's OK."

731
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,750
I've really missed you.

732
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:28,833
I've missed you too.

733
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,167
I tell ya, Pumbaa.  This stinks.

734
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,417
 Oh.  Sorry.

735
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:41,583
Not you. Them! Him. Her. Alone...

736
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,000
What's wrong with that?

737
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,333
I can see what's happening
What?

738
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,500
And they don't have a clue
Who?

739
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:51,250
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line

740
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:54,083
Our trio's down to two.Oh...

741
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:56,917
Ze sweet caress of twilight

742
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,333
There's magic everywhere

743
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:05,500
And with all this romantic atmosphere

744
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,583
Disaster's in the air

745
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:20,500
Can you feel the love tonight?

746
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:25,917
The peace the evening brings

747
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,167
The world, for once, in perfect harmony

748
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:38,833
With all its living things

749
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:44,583
So many things to tell her

750
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:48,583
But how to make her see

751
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:52,583
The truth about my past? Impossible!

752
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:54,667
She'd turn away from me

753
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:56,833
He's holding back, he's hiding

754
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:59,583
But what, I can't decide

755
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,167
Why won't he be the king I know he is

756
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:08,333
The king I see inside?

757
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,750
Can you feel the love tonight?

758
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,917
The peace the evening brings

759
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:25,667
The world, for once, in perfect harmony

760
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:29,500
With all its living things

761
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:37,833
Can you feel the love tonight?

762
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:43,833
You needn't look too far

763
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:52,167
Stealing through the night's uncertainties

764
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:56,333
Love is where they are.

765
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:04,333
And if he falls in love tonight

766
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:10,333
It can be assumed

767
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:17,583
His carefree days with us are history

768
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:26,167
In short, our pal is doomed

769
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:38,417
Isn't this a great place?

770
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,667
It is beautiful.... But I don't understand something.

771
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:47,750
You've been alive all this time. 
Why didn't you come back to Pride Rock?

772
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,167
Well, I just ... needed to get out on my own.

773
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,917
Live my own life. And I did. And it's great!

774
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,167
We've really needed you at home.

775
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:58,917
No one needs me.

776
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,250
Yes we do! You're the king.

777
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:04,000
Nala, we've been through this. I'm not the king.  Scar is.

778
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:08,083
Simba, he let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands.

779
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:10,083
What?

780
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,167
Everything's destroyed. There's no food, no water.

781
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,833
Simba, if you don't do something soon, everyone will starve.

782
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:17,167
I can't go back.
 Why?

783
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,417
You wouldn't understand.
What wouldn't I understand?

784
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:21,167
No, no, no. It doesn't matter. Hakuna Matata.

785
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,833
What?

786
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,333
Hakuna Matata. It's something I learned out here.
Look, sometimes bad things happen

787
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:30,667
Simba! 
 ...and there's nothing you can do about it! So why worry?

788
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,917
Because it's your responsibility.

789
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,250
Well, what about you? you left.

790
01:01:36,417 --> 01:01:42,000
I left to find help! And I found you.
Don't you understand? You're our only hope.

791
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:47,833
Sorry.
What's happened to you? You're not the Simba I remember.

792
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,917
"You're right; I'm not. Now are you satisfied?"

793
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,667
No, just disappointed.

794
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,250
You know, you're starting to sound like my father.

795
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:59,333
Good. At least one of us does.

796
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:02,667
Listen!  You think you can just show up and tell me how to live my life?

797
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:04,917
You don't even know what I've been through.

798
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,083
I would if you'd just tell me!

799
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,250
Forget it! Fine!

800
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:17,333
She's wrong. I can't go back. What would it prove, anyway?

801
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:21,333
It won't change anything. You can't change the past.

802
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:29,083
You said you'd always be there for me!... But you're not.

803
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:38,417
And it's because of me. It's my fault.... It's my ... fault.

804
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,583
Come on, will you cut it out?

805
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:28,917
Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back!

806
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:32,583
Creepy little monkey. Will you stop following me? Who are you?

807
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:36,167
The question is: whooo... are you?

808
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,417
I thought I knew.... Now I'm not so sure.

809
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:45,833
Well, I know who you are. Shh. Come here. It's a secret.

810
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:52,417
Ernh! Enough already!  ...What's that supposed to mean anyway?

811
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:55,167
It means you are a baboon-- and I'm not.

812
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,167
I think, you're a little confused.

813
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,417
"Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused; 
you don't even know who you are!"

814
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:07,083
Oh, and I suppose you know.

815
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:09,333
"Sure do; You're Mufasa's boy!"

816
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:13,167
Bye!

817
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,667
Hey, wait!

818
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,250
You knew my father?

819
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,250
Correction-- I know your father.

820
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:34,000
I hate to tell you this, but he died. A long time ago.

821
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:40,167
Nope. Wrong again! Hah hah hah! He's alive and I'll show him to you.

822
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:44,250
"You follow old Rafiki; he knows the way. Come on!"

823
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:55,833
Don't dawdle....  Hurry up!

824
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,750
Hey, whoa. Wait, wait.

825
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,500
Come on.  Come on!

826
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,167
Would you slow down?

827
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:23,833
STOP!  Shhh. Look down there.

828
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,417
That's not my father. That's just my reflection.

829
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:55,667
Noo. Look ... harder.

830
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:08,250
You see ... he lives in you.

831
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,667
Simba . . .

832
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:17,417
Father?

833
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:27,750
Simba, you have forgotten me.

834
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,000
No. How could I?

835
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:33,333
You have forgotten who you are, and so have forgotten me.

836
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:39,750
Look inside yourself, Simba. 
You are more than what you have become.

837
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:44,000
You must take your place in the Circle of Life.

838
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,417
How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be.

839
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:59,417
Remember who you are. You are my son, and the one true king.
Remember who you are.

840
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,667
No! Please! Don't leave me.

841
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,667
Remember...
 Father! 
 Remember...

842
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:11,083
Don't leave me.
 Remember...

843
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:26,417
What was that? The weather-- Pbbbah!  Very peculiar. Don't you think?

844
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:30,167
Yeah. Looks like the winds are changing.

845
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,250
Ahhh, change is good.

846
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:36,167
Yeah, but it's not easy. I know what I have to do.

847
01:07:36,417 --> 01:07:40,333
But, going back means I'll have to face my past.

848
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:46,500
I've been running from it for so long....Oww! Jeez-- what was that for?

849
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:48,917
"It doesn't matter; it's in the past!"

850
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,417
Yeah, but it still hurts.

851
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:58,250
Oh yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it, 
you can either run from it... or ... learn from it.

852
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:03,583
Hah!  You see?  So what are you going to do?

853
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:04,917
First... I'm going to take your stick.

854
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:09,000
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!
Hey!  Where are you going?

855
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,250
I'm going back!

856
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,750
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

857
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:37,250


858
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:39,667
Hey. Hey, wake up.

859
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:46,083
It's OK. Whoa, whoa. It's OK. It's me.

860
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:51,667
Don't ever do that again! Carnivores, oy!

861
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:54,333
Have you guys seen Simba?

862
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:56,083
I thought he was with you.

863
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,250
He was, but now I can't find him. Where is he?

864
01:08:58,333 --> 01:09:03,250
Ho ho ho ho!  You won't find him here.
  Ha ha. The king has returned.

865
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:06,833
I can't believe it. He's gone back!

866
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:12,333
Gone back? What do you mean? Hey! 
What's going on here?  Who's the monkey?!

867
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,750
Simba's gone to challenge Scar.

868
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:17,000
Who? 
 Scar.
Who's got a scar?

869
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:19,250
No, no, no. It's his uncle.
The monkey's his uncle?

870
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:23,417
No! Simba's gone back to challenge his uncle 
to take his place as king.

871
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:24,667
Ohhh.

872
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:27,583
Simba, wait up! It's awful, isn't it?

873
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I didn't want to believe you.

874
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:33,917
What made you come back?

875
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:38,250
I finally got some sense knocked into me. 
And I've got the bump to prove it.

876
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:42,917
Besides, this is my kingdom.  If I don't fight for it, who will?

877
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:46,417
I will.

878
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It's going to be dangerous.

879
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,417
Danger? I laugh in the face of danger. Hah ha ha haa!

880
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:54,583
I see nothing funny about this.

881
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:58,250
Timon? Pumbaa? What are you doing here?

882
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,750
 At your service, my liege.

883
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:03,083
Uh.. We're going to fight your uncle ... for this?

884
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
"Yes, Timon; this is my home."

885
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:13,667
Phh. Talk about your fixer-upper. Well, Simba, 
if it's important to you we're with you to the end.

886
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:41,250
Live bait.

887
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:43,417
Good idea. Hey.

888
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,333
Come on, Timon-- you guys have to crate a diversion.

889
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,417
What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?

890
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:52,750
If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat

891
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,917
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat

892
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:57,167
Come on down and dine
On this tasty swine

893
01:11:57,167 --> 01:11:59,083
All you have to do is get in line

894
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:01,167
Aaaare ya achin'
Yup, yup, yup

895
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,167
Fooor some bacon?
Yup, yup, yup

896
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,250
Heee's a big pig
Yup, yup, yup

897
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:06,750
You could be a big pig too.
Yup, yup

898
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:15,583
Nala, you find my mother and rally the lionesses.
I'll look for Scar.

899
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:22,083
SARABIII!

900
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,750
Yes, Scar?

901
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:42,417
Where is your hunting party? 
They're not doing their job.

902
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:45,667
Scar, there is no food. The herds have moved on.

903
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,500
No. You're just not looking hard enough.

904
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:54,833
It's over. There is nothing left. 
We have only one choice. We must leave Pride Rock.

905
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,083
We're not going anywhere.

906
01:12:56,917 --> 01:12:58,833
Then you have sentenced us to death!

907
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:00,667
Then so be it.

908
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:02,583
You can't do that.

909
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:04,583
I'm the king. I can do... whatever I want.

910
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:06,667
If you were half the king Mufasa was you would neve--

911
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:08,500
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

912
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:13,500
Mufasa? No-- you're dead.

913
01:13:20,417 --> 01:13:22,333
Mufasa?

914
01:13:23,417 --> 01:13:25,833
"No; it's me."

915
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:31,250
Simba? You're alive? How can that be?

916
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:34,083
"It doesn't matter; I'm home."

917
01:13:35,417 --> 01:13:42,083
Simba? Simba! I'm a little surprised to see you... alive.

918
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:49,167
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart.

919
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:54,250
Oh, Simba, you must understand. The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

920
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,917
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

921
01:13:58,083 --> 01:14:02,833
Oh, oh, ye-- Well, I would, heh, naturally, 
heh-- however, there is one little problem.

922
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,917
You see them? They think I'm king.

923
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,917
Well, we don't. Simba is the rightful king.

924
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:16,333
The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or fight.

925
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:22,750
Oh, must it all end in violence? 
I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member. 

926
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,333
Wouldn't you agree, Simba?

927
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:27,917
That's not gonna work, Scar.  I've put it behind me.

928
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:31,750
Eh, but what about your faithful subjects?  
Have they put it behind them?

929
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:33,833
Simba, what is he talking about?

930
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:37,833
Ahh, so you haven't told them your little secret.

931
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:45,333
Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them. 
Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death!

932
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,917
I am.

933
01:14:54,750 --> 01:15:00,167
It's not true. Tell me it's not true.

934
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:03,250
It's true.

935
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:07,000
You see, he admits it! Murderer!

936
01:15:06,917 --> 01:15:08,833
No! It was an accident!

937
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:10,750
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive.

938
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,167
It's your fault he's dead.... Do you deny it?

939
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:15,917
No.
Then ... you're ... guilty!

940
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:18,250
No. I'm not a murderer.

941
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:25,000
Oh Simba, you're in trouble again. 
But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you.

942
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:26,417
And now everyone knows why!

943
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:30,167
Simba!

944
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:33,917


945
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:40,083
Now this looks familiar. Hmm.  Where have I seen this before.

946
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:44,667
Let me think. Hmmm... hmmm. Oh yes, I remember.

947
01:15:45,083 --> 01:15:49,000
This is just the way your father looked before he died.

948
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:57,167
And here's my little secret.  I killed Mufasa.

949
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,750
NoooooOOO.... MURDERER!

950
01:16:03,917 --> 01:16:05,833
No, Simba please.

951
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:07,000
Tell them the truth.

952
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:11,417
Truth? But, truth is in the eye of the beholdllgkkk!

953
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,583
All right. All right. I did it.

954
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,500
So they can hear you.

955
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:22,083
I ... killed ... Mufasa!

956
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:34,583

01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:37,917
'Scuse me. Pardon me. Comin' through. Hot stuff.  Whoo!

958
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:08,917

01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:13,833
Let me in let me in! Pleeease don't eat me.

960
01:17:14,667 --> 01:17:16,250
Problem?

961
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:18,167
Hey, who's the pig?

962
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:20,500
Are you talking to me?
 - Uh oh. They called him a pig.

963
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,417
Are you talking to me?! - Shouldn't 'a done that.

964
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,167
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?!?

965
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:25,083
Now they're in for it.

966
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,917
THEY CALL ME.. MISTER PIIIG! AAAAAAAAAAA--

967
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:33,750
Take that! And that!

01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:40,333
Take that! And that! You yellow belly...

969
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:02,833
Murderer.

970
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,083
Simba, Simba. Please. Please have mercy. I beg you.

971
01:18:06,417 --> 01:18:08,333
You don't deserve to live.

972
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:12,750
But, Simba, I am ... ah ... family.

973
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,917
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.

974
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:20,750
It was their fault-- it was their idea!

975
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:25,500
Why should I believe you? Everything you ever told me was a lie.

976
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:31,083
What are you going to do? You wouldn't kill your old Uncle...?

977
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:35,500
No, Scar.  I'm not like you.

978
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:41,417
Oh, Simba, thank you. You are truly noble.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

979
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,667
How can I, ah, prove myself to you?
 Tell me, I mean, anything.

980
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:50,167
Run. Run away, Scar. And never return.

981
01:18:52,917 --> 01:18:59,833
Yes. Of course....  As you wish, your Majesty!

982
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,417
Ahh, my friends.

983
01:19:57,917 --> 01:20:01,833
Frie-he-hends? I thought he said we were the enemy!

984
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:05,000
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Ed?

985
01:20:09,417 --> 01:20:12,667
No. L-L-L-Le-Le-Le-Le-Let me explain.

986
01:20:12,917 --> 01:20:16,833
No. You don't understand. 
No! I didn't mean for... No, No!

987
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:21,083
Look, I'm sorry I called you...  No! NOO!

988
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,667
It is time.

989
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,750
Remember . . .

990
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:39,000
'Til we find our place

991
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:43,250
On the path unwinding

992
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:49,750
In the Circle

993
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:55,333
The Circle of Life

994
01:22:56,167 --> 01:23:02,083
The Circle of Life
