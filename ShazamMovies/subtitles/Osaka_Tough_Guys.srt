Here comes Makoto and Eiji
of Tsutenkaku High.

Right, this is the kind of chance
you only get once in a hundred years.

Let's pay them back

Still got a dick?

Do you want me to shave you again?

31

right off your shoulders.

It's the last fart of the fox!

You dummy! You mean
the last fart of the badger.

63
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,262
Badger? No, no, it's fox.

64
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,532
It's definitely badger.
I'll put money on it.

65
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,654
I would like to make it very clear here,

66
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,753
that our priority must always be to uphold
the good name of Tsutenaku High School.

67
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,727
And, ladies and gentlemen,

68
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:18,265
please ensure that the student body
is equally committed to this policy.

69
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,767
Anyway, we've thrown
Yamada and Fukenaga out,

70
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,271
so I'm sure our school will be
a bit quieter from now on.

71
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:34,746

I can at last sleep soundly.

72
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,917
I'm so happy...

We're gonna have to lean on you a bit.

77
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,202
Someone...police!...Telephone!
Please call the police!

78
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,374
Freeze!

79
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,982
Interesting suggestion.

80
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,975
If you really want to,
call the police.

81
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,413
But I'm gonna have to spread the word
about what goes on here.

82
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,748
There's no secret amongst friends.

83
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,960
You, as head teacher, are accepting
bribes for backdoor admissions.

84
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,261
You know...?

85
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,791
Now for the deputy head teacher.

86
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,666
You're having an affair with the
mother of one of your students!

87
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,834
Not forgetting the course leader!
You're sleeping with one of the students!

88
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,873
Do you want everyone to know about it?

89
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,281
Rie...

90
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,787
If people outside know about this,
the reputation of the school will be shit.

91
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:48,391
And, as from next year, no one
will want to enroll anymore, huh?

92
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,189
Bad news!

93
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,590
Don't call the police, OK?

94
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,596
That's a good head teacher.
You're not completely stupid.

95
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,000
So maybe you'd be prepared to forget
that notice about expelling us from school?

96
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,265
- What? That's...
- That's what I could say,

97
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,241
but since we fucking hate this fucking
stupid school anyway, we're gonna split.

98
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,273
Thanks!

99
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,036
Don't get too relaxed.

100
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,205
As we're prepared to leave,
why not give us a farewell gift?

101
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,309
A farewell gift...?

102
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,045
I'm talking about a little memento for two
intelligent young men with a bright future.

103
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,781
Make sure you give way
to your generous nature.

104
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,832
Are you totally serious?

105
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,008
You think that's enough?

106
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,508
Hey! Open the fucking safe!
I know you've got shitloads in there!

107
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,045
This is the national bank
of black economy, right?

108
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,272
We're prepared to settle
for one million yen!

109
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,250
One million...one million yen?

110
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,288
What?

111
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,018
Are you giving it to us or what?

112
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,089
No problem.
I'll give you one million yen.

113
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,436
Is there anything else
you need from me?

114
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:09,304
You know about the last fart?
Does that refer to a fox or a badger?

115
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,501
A weasel, of course.

116
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,072
Weasel?

117
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:18,707
The proverb goes,
'The weasel's last fart is the smelliest. <i>'</i>

118
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,754
So it was weasel after all.

119
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,315
You learn something new...

120
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,491
OK! Let's get to the safe.

121
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,976

Let's party!

122
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,271

123

Don't come up with crap suggestions.

124
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,317

A hostess club!

125
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,921

Can't you come up with anything better?

126
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,717
Then where do you wanna go?

127
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,555
Let's think...

128
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,759
You can't come up with
anything either!

129

You fucker! Who do you
think you're talking to?

142
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,239
This is the big boss of Kinsu sect.

143
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,440
Hey, hey, Sabu, Sabu, Sabu.
Stop showing off on the stairs.

144
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,847
He's just an ordinary citizen.
Leave him alone.

145
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,551
- I'm sorry.
- Go!

146
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,350

00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,685
Please have a seat.
Good evening gentlemen.

160
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,994
- Here we go!
- Come on!

161
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,729
What do you think you're doing?
You boys!

162
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,832
We've got loads of money here.
Why don't you be nice to us, huh?

163
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,990
Stop it, will you?

164
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:52,604
It's not a pink salon here.
Please behave like gentlemen.

165
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,864
If you don't know how to behave,
nobody's going to look after you.

166
00:12:56,642 --> 00:13:00,134
- What the fuck is that?
- What the fuck is that?

167
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,074
<i>That's for you, darling.</i>

168
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,513
- And for you, too.
- You're lucky.

169
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,212
Darling, show us your pussy.
I'll give you 20,000 yen.

170
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,687
- What?!
- You heard!

171
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,147
Boss, I'll show you my dick!

172
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,886
Hey, here's your present.
Take it!

173
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,858
Thank you!

174
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,293
Hey, hey, Makoto!
Why don't you give her something, too?

175
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,028
- OK!
- That's my money! Mine!

176
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,871
- It's a present for you. Take it! Take it!
- You know how things work!

177
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,336
OK! Bring lots of
expensive drinks in!

178
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,342
Let's get wasted!

179
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:44,086
- See, champagne really is the best!
- Is it nice?

180
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,962
Wow, you're right!

181
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,491
You see, pickled plums
are just for licking...

182
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,366
Hey, what're they drinking?

183
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,706
Is it much more expensive than ours?

184
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,707
Oh, that's Shochu.

185
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,371
Shochu?!

186
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,308
A lot of yakuza have liver problems or
get diabetes because they drink too much.

187
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,781
A lot of the top bosses
have died recently.

188
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,884
So most of them drink Shochu
nowadays, right?

189
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:21,185
Never mind, guys, you're young so drink
up and don't worry about your liver!

190
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,191
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

191
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,399
Here we go!

192
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,538
Yeah!

193
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,380
<i>One million yen</i>

194
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,144
What's that?

195
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,783
What?

196
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,755
The numbers of bottles
and service charge here...

197
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,196
One million yen?!

198
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,799
Aren't you overcharging us?

199
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,348
What the fuck are you on about?

200
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,395
We never said...we wouldn't pay.

201
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,983

202

00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,259

00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:26,045
Hung over.
You?

206
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,446
Yeah, me too.

207
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,453
Don't you have anything to drink?

208
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,124
No.

209
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,158
Water will do.

210
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:48,632
Oh no, I haven't paid the
water bill so they stopped it.

211
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,532
What?

212
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,305
What the fuck!

213
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,380
There's a pancake for you.

214
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,880
That's your puke, man.

215
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,975
I'm letting you stay here.
Stop complaining.

216
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,381
Alright then, I'll go and get juice.

217
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:06,782
Cheers.

218
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,686
What's going on?
I haven't got any money.

219
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,189
What?

220
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:17,567
We used that one million yen we got
from the head at the club last night.

221
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,375
Have you got any?

222
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,937
Wait.

223
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,019
Not much.

224
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,797
I wanna go home.

225
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,003
I even miss that horrible food
my mom cooks.

226
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,003
Why don't you go home then?

227
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,901
I'm not asking you
to stay here with me.

228
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:07,583
Don't get pissed.
Hey, Eiji, don't be angry, huh?

229
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,715
Hey, Eiji, you've got a hard-on.

230
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,790
That's my special talent.

231
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,185
I'm well today like always
and my dick's stiff!

232
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,018
- Let's put it to music!
- Let's put it to music!

233
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,390
We've got some change left anyway.
Let's go and get some food.

234
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,429
Yeah, let's go.

235
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,228
<i>Stiff dick pon pon,
Stiff dick pan.</i>

236
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:28,439
<i>Stiff dick pon pon,
Stiff dick pan.</i>

237
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,604
<i>Stiff dick pon pon.</i>

238
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,443
- No, no, no!
- What?

239
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,848
That's the expensive one!

240
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,184
- What the fuck?!
- It's only cup noodles, take this one instead.

241
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,986
This one tastes nicer!

242
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,652
This one's cheaper!

243
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,797
- It's 20 yen difference! What's the problem?!
- We're on an economy drive!

244
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,013
Thank you for helping me
the other day.

245
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,080
You don't need to thank us.
It was nothing.

246
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,781
Yeah, don't worry.

247
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,023
Thanks.

248
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,233
See you then.

249
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,467
She smiled.
I think she's got the hots for me.

250
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,144
She smiled at me.

251
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,541
- No, at me man.
- No, no, at me.

252
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,478
- At me.
- At me!

253
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,551
That's 1,755 yen please.

254
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:01,764
I'm sorry, I don't seem to have enough
money. I'll have to put something back.

255
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,698
What? I've already rung it in.
Just take them back quickly!

256
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,064
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,069
How much are you short?

258
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,241
Hey, Makoto!

259
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,513
How much are you short, then?

260
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,743
Hey, I'm asking how much!

261
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,144
Ah...well...

262
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,781
That should be enough!

263
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,794
Excuse me?
You can't do that!

264
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,387
That's fine.

265
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,491
Excuse...

266
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,566
We'll be back again.

267
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,072
Makoto!
Makoto!

268
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,501
- Let's go and steal money off some kids.
- Butthead!

269
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,509
We're going to a bookstore.

270
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,910
Makoto? Are you gonna
work at a bookstore?

271
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,986
Butthead! We're gonna steal
a recruitment magazine.

272
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,637
Hello.

273
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,930
Ms. Hayama?

274
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,406
You haven't paid me the rest
of this month's rent yet.

275
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:24,173
I'm very sorry.
I'll pay you as soon as I get paid.

276
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,180
I trust you.

277
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,213
But you know,

278
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:34,786
we need money to live as well, so it's
hard sometimes if you don't pay on time...

279
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,852
I'm very sorry.

280
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,229
Ah, yes, your mother called earlier.

281
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,403
She said she wasn't well again and will
have to stay in the hospital for a while.

282
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,432
OK, thanks.

283
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,645
I know it's none of my business,

284
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,039
but isn't it time you packed up
and went back to your hometown?

285
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,986
I know you want to be an actress,
but it's just a dream.

286
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,015
Isn't it better if you go back home
and look after your mother?

287
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,994
The rent for this month.
Please don't forget!

288
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,422
Experienced...skills...?

289
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,928
Sniffing glue and jerking off
aren't skills, are they?

290
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,866
It's a waste of time.

291
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:55,937
What?

292
00:22:56,074 --> 00:23:00,534
No one's going to hire us. We didn't
even graduate from high school.

293
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:06,309
Life's not easy, is it?

294
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,488
That's it!
Eiji! That's it!

295
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,625
Men from 17 to 25 years old wanted.
No experience required.

296
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,831
Possible quick promotion.
Salary over 500,000 yen a month.

297
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,701
Salary over 500,000 yen a month!

298
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,496
- 500,000 yen a month?!
- Yeah!

299
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,938
- Is that really true?
- Yeah, it's totally true, man!

300
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:34,442
- That's fucking great!
- That's fucking great!

301
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:42,948
- Hey, shouldn't we be wearing suits?
- Yeah, but these are the only clothes I have.

302
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:47,481
<i>Warning! Muggers and sex offenders have
been operating in this area - Naniwa CPA</i>

303
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,728
Muggers!

304
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,122
Don't worry.
We're gonna be OK.

305
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,291
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

306
00:23:56,401 --> 00:24:00,132
- Do we really look like salarymen?
- Yeah, we do. Don't worry.

307
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,199
Are you sure this is the right station?

308
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,566
Yes, I'm sure.

309
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,970
It looks kind of run down for a company
that pays over 500,000 yen a month.

310
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,978
Butthead! Wise people say you
never judge by appearances.

311
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,151
This is obviously a company that values
real worth rather than appearance.

312
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:03,165
I think that's the pick-up car they meant.

313
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,668
Shall we ask?

314
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,804
Excuse me?

315
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,404
Are you here from Takaranoyama
Trading Ltd to pick us up?

316
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,237
Yes, that's right, sir.

317
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,545
We're here for the interview.

318
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:22,151
Certainly. Please get in the car.
I'll take you to the interview hall.

319
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,653
Thank you very much.

320
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,463
Haven't we seen that
old fart somewhere?

321
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,700
We've seen him somewhere...

322
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,798
...I can't remember.

323
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:43,839
What?

324
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,111
Please...please...calm...ca...ca...
calm...please...calm down.

325
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:55,248
I'm Tokichi Kinoshita, from Yamanosato
University...animal husbandry course.

326
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,384
- Nice to meet you!
- What the fuck is he?!

327
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:03,788
If I get the position, I'm prepared
to overcome any difficulty.

328
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,455
Who is he?!

329
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,791
He must've thought we were
the interviewers.

330
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,492
What"?

331
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,462
A little...

332
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:21,708
Gentlemen, we're going now
so please get in the car.

333
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,538
Here we go, gentlemen.

334
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,502
We're here.
Please.

335
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,112
To the interview hall.

336
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,580
Here we are, gentlemen.
Please follow me to the interview hall.

337
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,182
Please...here.

338
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,187
Here.
Please follow me.

339
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,592
- Please watch your step there.
- Yes.

<i>INTERVIEW HALL</i>

341
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:32,547
That old fart as well...
I've seen him somewhere.

342
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,771
Welcome to the Kinsu sect.

343
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,378
K...Kinsu sect?

344
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,772
- Yakuza! This is a yakuza sect, yakuza!
- What?

345
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,380
- They're yakuza!
- We've been conned!

346
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,110
Shut the fuck up!

347
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:15,454
From today, you and us are all going to
work hard and live together like family.

348
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:20,355
You...you must be joking, man.
We're not here to become yakuza.

349
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:27,065
You jerks, being taken in so easily.
You've got nowhere to run to anymore.

350
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:30,574
Why don't you chill out
and do what we say?

351
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,242
Ahh! That guy!

352
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:37,140
Why don't you clean your fucking ears
and listen to me?

353
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:42,575
We know what kind of lowlife you are
from the CV you sent us.

354
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,184
We hired a private detective to make
sure that the information was accurate.

355
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:50,690
All of you are pieces of shit.

356
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,193
Even your parents have
given up on you.

357
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,659
Nobody will notice you've gone.

358
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,798
There's no way out for you.

359
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,867
We know exactly where you live
and where your parents live.

360
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:14,444
This is a contract to give your lives to us.
Sign it with your blood right now...

361
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,785
...right here, will you?

362
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,461
You're totally upfront, aren't you?
Well done!

363

I'm Tokichi Kinoshita...from Yamanosato

Shut the fuck up
and give me your hand.

365
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,137
Yes.

Thank you.

<i>KINSU CORPORATION</i>

373
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,837
Let me introduce you to
the new faces.

374
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,441
I'm Makoto Fukunaga.

375
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:14,704
I'm Eiji Yamada.

376
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,278
I'm Tokichi Kinoshita...

377
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,248
I've heard that hundreds of times!

378
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:24,245
This gentleman is the
Kinsu sect's big boss.

379
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,885
And this gentleman here is
Brother Amachi, the second boss.

380
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,921
Greetings!

381
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,552
Hello.

382
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,763
Thank you very much for having us!

383
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,571
Thank you very much for having us.

384
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:42,966
OK, good.

385
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,369
Work hard and get to be good
yakuza as soon as possible.

386
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:46,744
Yes.

387
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,942
Not yes, say yes sir!

388
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,539
Yes, sir!

389
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,282
Anyway, they look like
young men with potential.

390
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,490
Well, all except this one.

391
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:05,925
Hey, Sab, take this money,
get them something nice to eat.

392
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,221
Yes.

393
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,328
- Not yes, say yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

394
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,994
When will you get it?

395
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,132
Listen!
The yakuza code is...

396
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:18,800
one - training, two - training,
three and four - training, and five...

397
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,110
...dick! Brush up your manhood!

398
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,210
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

399
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:27,950
In the Kinsu sect, you're strictly forbidden
to touch thinners, pills and powder.

400
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,179
Make sure you remember that.

401
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,614
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

402
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:34,584
To become yakuza, you have to go
through very hard training.

403
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:39,820
But when you master it all, you get
first class pussy and lots of dinero.

404
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,395
One more thing.

405
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,364
Like Che Guevara first said,
'Be loved by the people. <i>'</i>

406
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,772
Become friends with the neighborhood
association, and be loved!

407
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,400
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

408
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:54,669
Our big boss also works as a vice-chairman
of the neighborhood association.

409
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,776
Make sure you don't disgrace
the Kinsu sect's name.

410
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,143
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

411
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,545
That's all!

412
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,649
- Dismissed!
- Yes, sir!

413
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,386
Come in.

414
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:17,431
You'll be sleeping in this
room from today.

415
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:21,028
But Brother, there are only
two beds in here.

416
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,706
That's correct.

417
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,499
You're gonna take turns
to keep watch all night.

418
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:31,011
When two of you are asleep,
the one works as a security guard.

419
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,810
An all night security guard?

420
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,817
That's what junior yakuza have to do.

421
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,045
Follow me to the next room.

422
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,249
Make sure you clean the toilet well.

423
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,252
If you leave any stain,

424
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:47,862
I'll make you use your tongue
to lick it clean, alright?

425
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:52,534
<i>KINSU SECT</i>

426
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,902
Usually you just stay in this room
and take telephone calls.

427
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:58,542
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

428
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,811
Kinoshita!
You clean the toilet.

429
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,947
What...

430
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,639
- Don't you wanna do it then?
- I will. I get it.

431
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,750
The rest of you, follow me.

432
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,816
- Yes, sir!
- You pissed yourself, huh?

433
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,121
OK.

434
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:22,626
You two clean this car.

435
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,494
Car cleaning...?!

436
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,033
Don't you jerk-offs understand?

437
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:30,335
This is an important part of
training to be a yakuza.

438
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:34,439
But make sure not to scratch it, alright?

439
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,876
This is what the Boss treasures most
next to his own life.

440
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:42,552
There was a guy who scratched it before
and he was beaten so badly he almost died.

441
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,454
Understood?

442
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,687
Hey, how did we end up like this?

443
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,762
It's too late to moan about it.

444
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,659
Yeah, you're right.

445
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,566
They've got a signed contract. Even
if we're desperate to quit, we can't.

446
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:05,268
We just have to put up
with things for a while.

447
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,777
And after that we get lots of money
and as many women as we want.

448
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,376
I admire your optimism.

449
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,377
What are you doing?

450
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,551
What, you?!

451
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,582
Hey, come on...

452
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,526
Oi, you...
what do you think you're doing...?

453
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,737
Give it to me!

454
00:34:56,427 --> 00:35:00,659
This is the best medicine
for a hangover.

455
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,566
You're the new faces,
is that right?

456
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,564
- Y...yes, sir.
- Y...yes, sir.

457
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:14,635
I'm the Head Captain of the
Kinsu sect, Kaizo Daimon.

458
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,439
I'm famous for making
crying babies...

459
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,585
...shut up.

460
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:32,453
I'm Makoto Fukunaga.

461
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:39,002
I'm Eiji Yamada.

462
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:47,807
The Boss has such good taste.
It's a nice car.

463
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,277
I'm gonna borrow this car, alright?

464
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,421
No, please don't.

465
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,621
Why?

466
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:00,816
But...

467
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,455
Don't worry.

468
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,223
I'm gonna drive around
and come back.

469
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,634
Oh shit!

470
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,500
- We're gonna be killed.
- What shall we do?

471
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:27,649
Has he just crashed...?

472
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,016
- Oh shit!
- Captain...!

473
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,759
- What's wrong?
- What've you done?!

474
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:41,055
The bo...the boss's car
has been damaged!

475
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,700
What the fuck have you done to it?!

476
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,731
- What?!
- What?!

477
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,434
Leave it to me.

478
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:54,904
What?!

479
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,137
I have a plan.

480
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,746
- What?!
- What?!

481
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,884
Why the fuck do we have
to be here with him?

482
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,395
I don't fucking know!

483
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:16,199
I've got a bad feeling.

484
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,662
You're freaking me out.

485
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,736
What the fuck are you
whispering about?

486
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,702
- Yes.
- Yes.

487
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,099
Captain! Do you think
it's gonna work?

488
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:29,769
Don't worry. This plan
I came up with, it can't fail.

489
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,976
This is a luxury residential quarter.

490
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:40,288
There must be lots of rich bitches driving
expensive cars like BMW's and Mercedes.

491
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:46,188
We target one of those luxury cars and
let it wreck this car, like BANG!

492
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,823
Oi, you old cow!

493
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,001
What have you done
to my car?!

494
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,228
What have you done to my dick?
Just look at it!

495
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:00,106
Then we get piles of money.

496
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,714
Here comes the target.
Ready?

497
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,581
Let's go!

498
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,554
Ready?

499
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:33,667
Oi, you old cow.
What have you done to my car?

500
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:37,638
What have you done to my dick...?
What? What?!

501
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,656
Can you come with us
to the police station?

502
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,991
I'm just passer-by A.

503
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,399
Right?

504
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,603
I'm B...

505
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,603
I'm C...

506
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:14,081
<i>A month later...</i>

507
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,817
Did you get everything, yeah?

508
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,081
Do you mean this?

509
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,591
Did you buy meat, yeah?

510
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,663
Yeah.

511
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,066
Yeah...ah, you...

512
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,228
Thank you for helping me the other day.

513
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,997
Let me return the money you lent me.

514
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,734
Don't worry.
It was just spare change.

515
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,911
Please accept this from me.

516
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,637
OK, if you insist.

517
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,687
Do you wanna take it home?

518
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:57,921
There're some vegetables and
some meat in here as well.

519
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,222
We bought a lot so don't be shy.

520
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:02,825
- Thank you.
- See you.

521
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,157
- Thank you.
- Yeah, don't worry.

522
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:06,530
Goodbye.

523
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,866
What's going on?

524
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,842
What do you mean?

525
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,981
- Huh?
- What man?! Nothing special, man!

526
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:22,241
Every time I see her face,
I feel like I need to take care of her.

527
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,955
That's love.

528
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,157
- What the fuck are you on about?
- It's love.

529
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,194
No, it's not!
Butthead!

530
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,797
You don't fool me.

531
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,933
Don't be stupid.
We're yakuza trainees, right?!

532
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:44,738
And she wouldn't have spoken to us
like that if she knew we were yakuza.

533
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,176
- That's right.
- Yeah.

534
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:49,977
What?

535
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,976
Makoto?
Makoto?

536
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,765
Do you want to talk
to me about something?

537
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,996
Yes sir!
Well...l wanted to ask...

538
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,100
When are we getting our wages?

539
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,974
- Wages?
- Yes.

540
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,747
You dummies!

541
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,186
It's not a company, it's a yakuza sect.
There's no such thing as wages!

542
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,582
Does that mean we're working for free?

543
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,788
We supply you with a place
to stay and food to eat.

544
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,852
What more do you need?

545
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,261
Nowadays youngsters don't know
what life's all about.

546
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,597
Hey, listen.

547
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,973
If you want money,
you have to earn it like in any business.

548
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,473
Yes, Captain Daimon taught us
about doing business deals,

549
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,441
and we ended up hitting a police car.

550
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,139
There are many different
kinds of business!

551
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,383
- Sabu, Sabu!
- Yes?

552
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:06,752
Don't just stand there like an idiot, why
don't you teach these fools the yakuza rules?

553
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,995
I'll do it myself.

554
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,463
Listen carefully.

555
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,091
This suit.

556
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:21,263
It's tailor-made in Britain.
It cost 800,000 yen.

557
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,243
This Cartier watch is pure gold
and was 2,500,000 yen.

558
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:31,108
These shoes, made in Italy,
cost 180,000 yen.

559
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,047
All of them were gifts from girls.

560
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:42,224
Business...you meant
getting gifts from women?

561
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,991
That's not the only sort of business.

562
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,460
We help guard hostess bars
and also get involved in debt collection.

563
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,595
We have many businesses here.

564
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,063
Let them practice, it's easier to learn that
way. Take them on some business now.

565
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:54,933
New?

566
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,434
Don't you want to or what?

567
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,335
Of course I do.

568
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,305
Excuse me.

569
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,306
Is Kinoshita coming too?

570
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,008
Just the two of you is fine.

571
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,148
Kinoshita isn't ready for it yet.

572
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:16,050
I'm Tokichi Kinoshita, from Yamanosato
University...animal husbandry course.

573
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,818
I know that, you half-wit!

574
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,554
I'm glad...

575
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,864
They're enforcing the new yakuza prevention
law, so it's difficult for us to work nowadays.

576
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,773
So what are we going to do now?

577
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,736
Debt collection.

578
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,502
That sounds easy.

579
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:45,045
You idiot, these are the people who had
the guts to borrow money from yakuza

580
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,451
and not return it.

581
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,990
They're not easy people to deal with.

582
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,357
Especially the ones we're going to
see today, they're the worst.

583
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,587
A couple who are addicted to gambling.

584
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,699
They cry like babies and beg
for money when they need it,

585
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:01,166
but once they've got the money,
they don't give a shit anymore.

586
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,271
What scumbags we ended up
giving money to!

587
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,185
That's it.

588
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,594
What kind of house is that?

589
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,427
I can't see them giving the money back.

590
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:39,309
We're from the Kinsu sect.
Excuse us!

591
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:42,805
Hi.

592
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:49,382
What?

593
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,584
How may I help you?

594
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:05,257
<i>Hey, Uni, Ohtoro and Rum'?</i>

595
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,968
You seem to be living it here.

596
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:13,206
So what if we are?
We're free to eat what we want.

597
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,677
Life isn't that simple.

598
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,405
If you have the money to eat sushi, why
don't you pay back the money you owe us?

599
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,418
OK, OK.

600
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,813
Someone gave this food to us.

601
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:31,221
We haven't got any money at all here.

602
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:32,588
You assholes!

603
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:34,664
I'm not leaving until you
at least pay us the interest today.

604
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:43,306
But your interest rate is too high
and we can't afford it anymore.

605
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:50,273
I'm sure you're making a very good living
out of the enormous interest we pay you!

606
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:54,445
Why bring that up now?
You assholes!

607
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,983
Didn't you know about the interest rate
when you took out the loan?

608
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:01,252
We didn't know anything
about the law at that time.

609
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:05,394
We didn't know that charging an extremely
high rate of interest was illegal.

610
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,323
What the fuck?

611
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:15,231
The Kinsu sect still seems to be
doing this sort of shark loaning.

612
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:18,197
If you like, we can speak
to the police, you know?

613
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:24,142
I heard your Boss has already
served four years in jail.

614
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:29,846
I'm sure if he goes back there again,
he'll end up doing at least eight!

615
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,021
Yeah, he's not young anymore, is he?

616
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:36,819
I'd imagine it would be very hard to
spend eight years inside at his age.

617
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,959
If that happens, it's your responsibility.
You know that?

618
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,456
Are you prepared to take
responsibility for it then?

619
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,132
He's right!

620
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:50,062
OK, OK, you understand?
Then please leave us now.

621
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,243
Do I have to look
at your pitiful faces?

622
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,274
Even this nice sushi tastes horrible
if I have to look at you all.

623
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,572
Yeah!

624
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,718
- We'll be back.
- Here you go.

625
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:09,885
Here you go.

626
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,093
- Here you go.
-Uh, I prefer Uni.

627
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:20,961
Keiko and I are keeping watch together.

628
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:30,707
Keiko...Keiko, please suck more.

629
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:34,509
Swing it...it's coming...coming.

630
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:38,345
Keiko...it's nice...Keiko...

631
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:52,596
What the fuck are you doing?
Dirty bastard!

632
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,333
Put it back now.

633
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,372
What do you...

634
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:01,544
You're overdoing it.
Your dick will be rubbed sore.

635
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:07,545
My turn to be on guard anyway.

636
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,921
Never mind.
I'm ready to go to sleep.

637
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,958
- What was that?
- Robbers?

638
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:24,363
Robbers? I don't think anyone
would break into a yakuza office.

639
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,662
Then you don't think
we're being attacked?

640
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,806
- Attacked?
- Attacked by another yakuza sect!

641
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,067
By another yakuza sect?!

642
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,609
Ready?

643
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,452
Open it.

644
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:57,098
I'm impressed with your hard work.

645
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,202
Ca...Captain...

646
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,910
Give me another drink.

647
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,591
Hey, Makoto.

648
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,494
What's wrong?
There's nothing wrong with the drink.

649
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:36,805
Eiji, I just wonder why he's
buying us all these drinks.

650
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:43,068
Come on, forget it.
Just sit back and enjoy it.

651
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,713
- Just drink, drink.
- Hey! Hey!

652
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,247
- Yes.
- Are you enjoying the drink, huh?

653
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:49,714
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

654
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,611
- Don't worry, drink as much as you want.
- Yes!

655
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,954
It's your money after all.

656
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,526
Captain...l thought it was on you?

657
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:04,330
Don't be silly.
I haven't got any money.

658
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,339
But we don't either.

659
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:17,976
Don't worry. You can just work
here and pay it back, yeah?

660
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:23,116
I thought it was too good to be true!

661
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,478
The Kinsu sect is hanging
around here then?

662
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,457
The quality of customers in this club
has certainly gone down.

663
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,728
Wait!

664
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:36,893
What?

665
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,135
You shitheads are from the Asashi sect!

666
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,299
What do you know about the
quality of club customers?

667
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:46,940
Daimon!

668
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,377
I wouldn't be so fastidious
if I were you.

669
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,741
That's the way I was born.

670
00:50:53,817 --> 00:51:00,086
Stop showing off,
you tiny-dicked fucker!

671
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,782
You big pussy!

672
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,813
You two, just run away now.

673
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,818
They won't notice you've gone.
That way we won't have to pay.

674
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,034
I'm worn out.

675
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:00,244
Makoto! Makoto!

676
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,776
What's wrong, brother?

677
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,047
Hurry HP-

678
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,354
- Hurry up!
- Nobody's here by the way.

679
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,394
What the fuck are you wearing?

680
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,399
Shut the fuck up, you idiot!
Look, I'm wearing them too, Makoto.

681
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,637
Are you going to open a
perverfs nightclub or something?

682
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:29,109
Shit for brains!
Listen carefully!

683
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:33,405
The punter's getting bored with high school
uniforms and high school girl's panties.

684
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,916
From now on, the luxury celebrity
lifestyle is the key to everything, alright?

685
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:39,988
Yeah, but what has it to do with
us wearing these panties?

686
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:41,850
Listen now.

687
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,083
We wear these luxury panties,

688
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:48,263
and tell them that Rie Miyazawa
or Kumiko Guto wore them.

689
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,200
Or Rie's mom's panties...
that's not bad either.

690
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,031
We'll make a packet!

691
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:56,400
Bizarre.

692
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,441
Shut the fuck up!
Business is bizarre!

693
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:03,639
Hey, see this here.
We've advertised in a porn mag.

694
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:09,250
Panties fresh from the pussies of celebrities
like Rie Miyazawa and Kumiko Goto

695

with their most intimate body odors
are on sale for a reasonable price.

696
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,915
Hey, are you gonna do it or not?

697
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:21,425
- Sure. Why not?
- Good, then wear these panties.

698
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,466
Oh dear...

699
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:30,471
Shut the fuck up!
Don't do that freaky voice!

<i>THE KINSU SECT</i>

701
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,569
No one here...

702
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,308
Nowadays young kids
are useless, aren't they?

703
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,375
They can't even take
telephone calls properly.

704
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,382
What do you want?
It's the Kinsu sect.

705
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,120
These give me a strange sensation.

706
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:54,387
Listen.

707
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,191
Make sure you make them
as dirty as possible.

708
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,368
But when you go for a piss,
make sure you don't wet them!

709
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:00,892
Yes, sir!

710
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,968
Ah, my balls fell out...

711
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,170
What?

712
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:13,081
Celebrity fresh panties sales office?

713
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,915
What the fuck are you talking about?
It's the Kinsu sect here!

714
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,687
Hello?

715
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:25,524
You want the panties off Rie Miyazawa?
Fuck you, I want them too!

716
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,799
The reason why I asked
you three to be here,

717
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:40,367
is to announce that you're officially
members of our sect from today.

718
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:46,513
Listen, we used to reserve an exclusive
restaurant to celebrate this kind of occasion,

719
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,116
but as you know, the cops are making it
difficult to do business these days.

720
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:53,152
So I've decided to use this kind
of family restaurant instead.

721
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:57,860
Order whatever you want, hamburger,
a steak or a children's meal...whatever.

722
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,759
Thank you, sir!

723
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:06,024
Today you will be given your badges
by the Boss. You're being honored.

724
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:07,664
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

725
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:15,410
Hey, hey you kids.
Hey, old bitches!

726
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:20,037
Those kids might be precious to their
parents, but to us they're just dirty little kids.

727
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,945
How can they be proud
of those dirty little fuckers?!

728
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,576
- You asshole, total asshole.
- Asshole, total asshole...

729
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,984
But you're different.
You're real family.

730
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,649
We're here to celebrate you
becoming members of our family.

731
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,986
If you have any problems,
come and talk to me. Right?

732
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,391
Yes, sir!

733
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,089
You're so fortunate that the Boss
is paying so much attention to you.

734
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,392
These gold badges
are made of pure gold.

735
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:41,833
They cost somewhere between 500,000
and 1 million yen!

736
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,296
Treat them well, alright?

737
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,470
Yes, sir!

738
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:49,271
OK, all sorted, so let's toast
with banana shakes, shall we?

739
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:51,013
- We all ready?
- Yes.

740
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,444
What?

741
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,050
Could I have a pint of beer please?

742
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,385
Chuck some water at him!

743
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:58,446
Idiot!

744
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,250
This is so strange.

745
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:09,228
I can't believe Rie Miyazawa's
panties aren't selling.

746
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:18,603
We haven't received
a single phone call.

747
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:25,111
Right! I'm gonna have to negotiate
directly with agents.

- They come with stains and are genuine.
- Show me the proof.

Proof?

Proof...but...

755

The proof that Rie was
really wearing those panties.

Customers aren't stupid nowadays.

757

00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,873
I could buy them for 200 yen.

00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:30,537
- 200 yen! Are you crazy!
- What are you looking at anyway?!

Mmmm, 200 yen is OK.

- Take them to the pawn shop.

That's how I'm gonna pay back the debts.

kill for Kinsu sect special badges.

783
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:02,228
No, no. I mean if someone finds out,
aren't we gonna be in trouble?

784
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:06,807
Don't worry, we'll get some dough
and buy them back.

785
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,741
Kinsu sect badges, is that right?

786
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,273
Yes, that's right.

787
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,679
All three together...

788
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:52,843
Yes, all three together...?

789
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,883
I would say 3,000 yen.

790
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,257
Just 3,000 yen?

791
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:08,128
It all depends on the sect, some badges
are worth 50,000 to 100,000 yen.

792
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,365
But that's the best I can do
for Kinsu sect badges.

793
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:18,904
I'm not being funny,
but it's only gold plating.

794
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:21,141
Gold plating?

795
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:23,649
They aren't pure gold then...

796
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,547
It wasn't true then...

797
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:29,246
You know, I'm doing you a favor
offering 3,000 yen for them.

798
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:30,787
Brother, don't even think about it.

799
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,121
No! 3,000 yen is fucking useless!

800
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:33,488
I understand.

801
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,395
Give me 3,000 yen please.

802
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,130
Brother?

803
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,973
That was a waste of time, wasn't it?

804
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,576
Our gold badges were just gold plated...
that's pathetic.

805
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,712
We can't go around
stony broke like this.

806
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,384
But we haven't got anything else
for the pawn shop.

807
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,111
- Makoto!
- Yes?

808
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,524
Can you drive a car?

809
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,352
Yes.

810
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,788
Excellent.

811
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:09,959
Go and steal a truck.

812
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,528
What?

813
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:19,771
I wonder what pills he takes...

814
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,591
This is the place.

815
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:44,857
What is it?

816
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,867
What a stench!

817
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,801
Wait...

818
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:59,737
Can't you see?
They're pigs!

819
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,645
I know what they are!

820
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,580
We can take as many as we want.

821
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,784
But what are you going to...?

822
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,752
What? If you take one
to the butcher, right...

823
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:15,988
Let's say they get 50 kilos of pork meat
out of one pig and 100g is worth 120 yen.

824
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:22,193
Just on a rough calculation, think
how much money we could make!

825
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,870
But how are you going to
move them to the truck?

826
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,849
One big haul of pig!

827
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:15,457
Let's Paw!

828
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,070
Let's party!
Let's have a toast! A toast!

829
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,907
- A toast!
- Here we go!

830
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,638
- Sit down, sit down, sit down.
- Ready!

831
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:38,540
- One more time!
- Again, again, again!

832
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:39,738
Come on then!

833
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:43,147
Cheers!

834
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,681
Here we go!

835
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,586
Please...suck it!

836
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,323
It stinks!

837
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:03,298
Come on...come on...
come on!

838
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,108
Stop it!

839
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,171
Stop it!

840
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:16,777
Sab, you're enjoying yourself, huh?

841
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,120
Yeah.

842
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,083
Can I join you, too?

843
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,590
No, no, no!

844
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:39,335
Stop it...Catherine...
Catherine...

845
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:43,534
We're going to have some fun!

846
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,381
The night's just started!

847
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:51,581
Let's go to the next club.

848
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,319
Sabu...

849
01:04:55,157 --> 01:05:00,060
If you're thinking you can run away
from me, you're mistaken.

850
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,594
- Come on, hurry up.
- Of course.

851
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,568
That's our next club.

852
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:16,568
What?

853
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,082
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

854
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:36,597
- They have nice girls here.
- Please come in, come in.

855
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,781
Welcome.
Welcome.

856
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:04,123
Hi.

857
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,921
So you work here, then?

858
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:09,861
I've been working here for a week,
but I'm still trying to get used to it.

859
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:13,067
Anyway, I've just finished
my shift, so I have to go now.

860
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:15,396
Are you going now?
Then I'll take you home.

861
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:16,933
- What?
- As your bodyguard.

862
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:21,304
If bad guys hassle you,
I can protect you, bang, bang, bang!

863
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:24,012
Thank you for your offer,
but what will your friends think?

864
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:34,154
Ah...they're...his friends.
Right?

865
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:38,021
- Yeah, that's right.
- So I don't have to worry about them.

866
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:42,490
I'm not gonna pull any tricks or anything.
I just wanna talk to you a bit, that's all.

867
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:46,867
Right, could you wait for me?
I'll go and change.

868
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,471
- OK, I'll wait for you outside.
- OK.

869
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,637
Good luck, huh?
Enjoy yourself.

870
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,368
I'm not thinking of doing anything.

871
01:06:56,746 --> 01:07:01,547
Whatever. Anyway, I'll let you
have my spare one for tonight.

872
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,851
- What's that?
- My rubber.

873
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,145
- I don't want it.
- Don't you want it?

874
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,686
- I don't want it.
- Come on, take it.

875
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:10,156
- I said I don't want it. I don't want it!
- Why don't you go then?!

876
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,362
Welcome, I'm Akemi.

877
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,872
Would you please marry me?

878
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,741
No! No! No!
No! No! No!

879
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:33,978
NO! No!
No!

880
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,990
This is insane...

881
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:54,400
Good evening gentlemen, from Asashi sect.
Thank you for choosing us.

882
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,599
- Is Akemi here?
- I'll send her to your table.

883
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,173
What?

884
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:14,987
Akemi...

885
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,366
So, you're an actress.

886
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,565
Well, still a trainee.

887
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,469
But I have to pay for
my drama course fees,

888
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:39,137
and make money for theater tickets, so I
work as a hostess because it pays well.

889
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,413
You're obviously working hard at it.

890
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:47,978
Not just me, everyone's working hard
so I have to work even harder.

891
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:53,394
I think your dream will come true,
the way you're working at it.

892
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,425
Actually...

893
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,023
What?

894
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:16,774
Today...

895
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:22,183
...I went on an audition and got selected
as the main character in a video.

896
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,316
That's fantastic!

897
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,491
Congratulations!

898
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:30,593
I should ask for your autograph now!

899
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:34,532
Thank you.
You're the first person I've told.

900
01:09:35,941 --> 01:09:39,433
Really?
I'm $0 happy for you

901
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:46,674
I've been talking about myself so much
and haven't asked anything about you.

902
01:09:47,286 --> 01:09:48,878
It doesn't matter about me.

903
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:51,113
What do you do?

904
01:09:51,356 --> 01:09:52,345
Job?

905
01:09:52,925 --> 01:09:55,894
My lob is...

906
01:09:56,562 --> 01:09:58,723
...I work for Takaranoyama Trading Ltd.

907
01:09:59,364 --> 01:10:00,854
So you're a businessman?

908
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:06,368
I've just finished my probation period.
I don't earn much yet.

909
01:10:07,706 --> 01:10:11,767
But I heard that if you work for a trading
company, you sometimes get to go abroad.

910
01:10:12,711 --> 01:10:14,474
I guess so.

911
01:10:14,813 --> 01:10:16,906
You're lucky you can travel abroad.

912
01:10:17,783 --> 01:10:19,944
Anyway, I hope our dreams come true.

913
01:10:23,422 --> 01:10:26,653
You only live once...

914
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:32,319
You're right.

915
01:10:33,766 --> 01:10:35,097
You're right.

916
01:10:36,835 --> 01:10:45,174
<i>You always smile and follow me.</i>

917
01:10:45,711 --> 01:11:00,888
<i>You don't talk a lot and are very shy.</i>

918
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:10,390
<i>I'm sorry to give you such a hard time.</i>

919
01:11:10,669 --> 01:11:28,315
<i>I want to make you happy
as many times as you cry.</i>

920
01:11:28,854 --> 01:11:43,360
<i>Let's drink together...</i>

921
01:12:00,853 --> 01:12:05,051
You can't call that singing.
That was fucking shit!

922
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,390
What the fuck?

923
01:12:07,659 --> 01:12:12,187
I'll show you how you should sing.

924
01:12:12,698 --> 01:12:15,792
Listen carefully.

925
01:12:20,105 --> 01:12:21,595
Boss...

926
01:12:22,307 --> 01:12:25,299
When the song ends,
take the fucking guy apart.

927
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:34,285
If Daimon starts the fight, even better.
One punch will see him out of the action.

928
01:12:35,687 --> 01:12:38,588
Testing...testing microphone.

929
01:12:41,827 --> 01:12:43,658
Let's go.

930
01:12:43,829 --> 01:12:45,626
Don't we have to listen
to the Captain's song?

931
01:12:45,731 --> 01:12:47,790
If you don't wanna die,
do what I'm doing.

932
01:12:57,109 --> 01:12:58,542
_ Come o
n! Hur
_Yes! W!

933
01:13:00,345 --> 01:13:02,870
Not that!
Do what I'm doing! Fast!

934
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:16,982
<i>Please wait for a moment...</i>

935
01:14:21,526 --> 01:14:24,586
I feel great!

936
01:14:26,064 --> 01:14:28,532
I've had a lot to drink!

937
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,825
I've enjoyed women!

938
01:14:31,436 --> 01:14:39,207
Why doesn't your stiff dick
make you money?

939
01:14:40,012 --> 01:14:41,707
Huh?

940
01:14:49,821 --> 01:14:51,789
<i>Why doesn't your stiff dick
make you money?</i>

941
01:14:51,857 --> 01:14:54,155
<i>Porn actor wanted for adult video.
Make money having sex with women.</i>

942
01:14:54,259 --> 01:14:59,561
Porn actor wanted...?

943
01:15:01,033 --> 01:15:03,661
That's it!

944
01:15:10,909 --> 01:15:12,638
The film starts shooting
today, doesn't it?

945
01:15:13,045 --> 01:15:15,673
Yes, thanks for calling.

946
01:15:16,882 --> 01:15:19,544
OK, good luck.

947
01:15:26,191 --> 01:15:28,159
Nice!

948
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:42,267
OK.

949
01:15:43,241 --> 01:15:45,607
- I'm back!
- Hey, your coffee's ready.

950
01:15:45,844 --> 01:15:47,277
Yeah, cheers.

951
01:15:48,747 --> 01:15:53,810
Going outside to make a telephone call...
what's the big deal, huh?

952
01:15:54,052 --> 01:15:56,111
- It's special today.
- Huh?

953
01:15:56,321 --> 01:15:58,255
- The first day of her film shoot.
- Good morning.

954
01:15:58,423 --> 01:16:02,257
- Good morning Brother!
- Good morning Brother!

955
01:16:03,028 --> 01:16:06,657
Hey, Makoto, why are you
looking so happy today?

956
01:16:06,832 --> 01:16:07,321
Well...

957
01:16:07,466 --> 01:16:10,492
Makotds girlfriend is shooting
her first video film today.

958
01:16:10,769 --> 01:16:14,068
I see. Makoto, you're lucky
to have such a nice girl.

959
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:15,900
Thank you, I know.

960
01:16:16,108 --> 01:16:17,598
But she'd better be careful.

961
01:16:17,876 --> 01:16:21,937
Sometimes they say it's a shoot for a
video film, but it turns out to be a porn film.

962
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,208
No way, she said the production company's
got a very good name for itself.

963
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:27,008
What's the name of the company?

964
01:16:27,252 --> 01:16:30,016
I think it was called 7 Star Productions.

965
01:16:31,256 --> 01:16:32,245
What?

966
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:35,751
Did you say 7 Star Productions?

967
01:16:36,194 --> 01:16:36,819
Yes...

968
01:16:38,497 --> 01:16:43,230
That's the production company
Asashi sect uses as a front.

969
01:16:43,502 --> 01:16:47,438
They do illegal porn videos.

970
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:53,572
Makoto! Hurry up and stop her
before it's too late!

971
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,778
Makoto! Hurry up now!

972
01:17:03,989 --> 01:17:07,755
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, I need to borrow it!

973
01:17:09,761 --> 01:17:11,558
Here we go!

974
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:14,694
Wait!
Wait!

975
01:17:42,827 --> 01:17:48,026
Hey, when's the male actor coming?
He's fucking late!

976
01:17:48,266 --> 01:17:50,928
Sorry, he's got stomach problems.
But the substitute should be here shortly.

977
01:17:51,836 --> 01:17:54,737
Sorry for the wait.
The substitute's here.

978
01:17:56,474 --> 01:17:58,101
Good morning.

979
01:17:58,210 --> 01:17:59,734
Get in here.
Hurry.

980
01:18:00,545 --> 01:18:02,206
This is the director.

981
01:18:02,814 --> 01:18:04,338
Excuse me.

982
01:18:04,649 --> 01:18:08,779
What are you? Some kind of weirdo!
Have you got a big dick then?

983
01:18:09,221 --> 01:18:11,781
Well, he's a big guy.
Let's hope he's got a big one to go with it.

984
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:18,418
There's a reason for it. If my mom
sees me, she'll go apeshit.

985
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:21,355
Anyway, looks aren't important
for porn actors.

986
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,589
Huh?

987
01:18:28,006 --> 01:18:31,669
Are you really saying
I can sleep with her?

988
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:36,743
You love it, don't you? It depends on
what kind of equipment you're packing.

989
01:18:37,282 --> 01:18:39,182
I'm confident.
Leave it to me.

990
01:18:49,861 --> 01:18:51,886
Massive!

991
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:54,798
I'll do my best.

992
01:19:12,717 --> 01:19:17,381
Wait for me!
I'll rescue you!

993
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:26,663
- Are you all ready?
- Yeah.

994
01:19:26,765 --> 01:19:29,893
Ready? Camera.
Camera!

995
01:19:30,135 --> 01:19:36,267
5...4...3...2..1!
Ready? Start!

996
01:19:40,245 --> 01:19:41,906
For what we are about to receive...

997
01:20:17,082 --> 01:20:24,147
Hey, listen up, this girl really
doesn't want to fuck, does she?

998
01:20:24,322 --> 01:20:27,883
Shut the fuck up
and just do it!

999
01:20:37,202 --> 01:20:37,964
What's that?

1000
01:20:42,507 --> 01:20:43,940
Makoto!

1001
01:20:47,212 --> 01:20:49,772
- I'm here to rescue you.
- Who the fuck are you?!

1002
01:20:53,118 --> 01:20:53,982
What's going on?

1003
01:20:54,352 --> 01:20:56,980
You're punks from the Kinsu sect, right?

1004
01:20:59,391 --> 01:21:02,792
You won't leave this place in one piece!

1005
01:21:02,961 --> 01:21:07,125
Shut the fuck up!
You assholes, setting that girl up!

1006
01:21:07,365 --> 01:21:11,597
Trying to be a hero, huh?
We're here on Asashi sect business!

1007
01:21:11,836 --> 01:21:13,997
I won't let you mess with our business!

1008
01:21:14,205 --> 01:21:18,335
I'm gonna make you regret
setting that girl up.

1009
01:21:19,244 --> 01:21:20,506
Get him!

1010
01:21:28,453 --> 01:21:30,318
Shoot it! Hurry!
Shoofl

1011
01:21:38,863 --> 01:21:40,160
Are you alright, Eiji?

1012
01:22:01,853 --> 01:22:02,820
Die!

1013
01:22:02,987 --> 01:22:03,578
No!

1014
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:24,808
Don't worry, you're safe now.

1015
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:40,817
Isn't that the Captain?

1016
01:22:40,925 --> 01:22:42,187
What?!

1017
01:22:50,902 --> 01:22:52,267
That's the Captain!

1018
01:22:52,537 --> 01:22:54,129
Eiji, hurry up!

1019
01:22:55,707 --> 01:22:57,470
Let's go!

1020
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,455
It was my fault.

1021
01:23:17,896 --> 01:23:21,457
I didn't know anything about it,
I was just over the moon to get the part.

1022
01:23:21,766 --> 01:23:24,929
No, that's not true.
You were set up.

1023
01:23:29,107 --> 01:23:33,942
I should've realized it couldn't be true,
someone like me given a leading role.

1024
01:23:34,112 --> 01:23:35,841
Don't think like that.

1025
01:23:36,347 --> 01:23:41,546
Keiko, you can be a star performer.

1026
01:23:42,687 --> 01:23:44,678
You'll definitely get the chance.

1027
01:24:00,972 --> 01:24:02,872
You're a winner.

1028
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:06,066
Don't cry.

1029
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:12,944
If you cry,
it means that you're a loser.

1030
01:24:24,429 --> 01:24:25,987
Thank you.

1031
01:24:29,867 --> 01:24:34,804
I like the Keiko who's always
cheerful and positive.

1032
01:24:37,809 --> 01:24:42,371
L...told you a lie.
I'm not a businessman.

1033
01:24:44,549 --> 01:24:51,182
I'm...I'm a...I'm a yakuza...

1034
01:24:59,897 --> 01:25:04,459
I don't care what you do, Makoto.

1035
01:25:07,872 --> 01:25:09,999
I like you.

1036
01:25:13,711 --> 01:25:18,614
I've liked you since
the moment we met.

1037
01:25:55,453 --> 01:25:59,890
<i>Hello. What?
A telephone call from the Asashi sect?</i>

1038
01:26:01,225 --> 01:26:03,193
<i>Yes, I'll put him through now.</i>

1039
01:26:05,663 --> 01:26:08,325
Hello, it's Amachi.

1040
01:26:09,233 --> 01:26:12,634
Oh, it's Hosoda of the Asashi sect.

1041
01:26:13,104 --> 01:26:14,503
Amachi...

1042
01:26:17,175 --> 01:26:20,338
...I haven't spoken to you
for a long time.

1043
01:26:21,979 --> 01:26:23,469
What do you want?

1044
01:26:23,715 --> 01:26:26,548
I know you've got two young members
called Makoto and Eiji.

1045
01:26:27,452 --> 01:26:31,115
They interfered in our business
the other day,

1046
01:26:31,956 --> 01:26:36,052
and some of our young members
were badly injured.

1047
01:26:39,597 --> 01:26:41,428
What?

1048
01:26:41,899 --> 01:26:45,892
You know you can't just
get away with it, right?

1049
01:26:48,139 --> 01:26:49,504
What are you trying to do?

1050
01:26:49,907 --> 01:26:54,241
We want compensation for the damage
and we want a gift by way of an apology.

1051
01:26:55,079 --> 01:27:03,714
And get one fingertip each from the kids
and pack them in the same package.

1052
01:27:10,194 --> 01:27:12,492
Hey, What's going on?

1053
01:27:13,431 --> 01:27:14,489
Hey?

1054
01:27:20,171 --> 01:27:24,267
Wow, the sun's so yellow today.

1055
01:27:30,715 --> 01:27:31,773
Bye.

1056
01:27:47,765 --> 01:27:50,563
Let's both give it our best shot.

1057
01:27:50,802 --> 01:27:54,568
Yes, you only live once.

1058
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:20,389
Tokyo Disneyland...
gentlemen please behave...

1059
01:28:26,637 --> 01:28:27,433
He's back.

1060
01:28:37,415 --> 01:28:39,610
Makoto, this is fucking serious!

1061
01:28:40,084 --> 01:28:42,052
Go and see the Boss right now.

1062
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:45,186
Good luck.

1063
01:28:46,858 --> 01:28:48,951
Obviously obeying their request,

1064
01:28:49,227 --> 01:28:52,287
and letting them chop their fingers off is
the right thing according to yakuza protocol.

1065
01:28:56,434 --> 01:28:59,631
I agree with that.

1066
01:28:59,737 --> 01:29:05,232
But the Asashi sect is already asking
for an absurd amount of compensation,

1067
01:29:05,843 --> 01:29:07,811
and they're not playing
by the rules either.

1068
01:29:08,045 --> 01:29:15,076
I understand our trainee was only rescuing
a girl he's close to and didn't hurt anyone.

1069
01:29:15,486 --> 01:29:20,048
I also understand those yakuza were all
beaten up by the porn actor they hired.

1070
01:29:20,424 --> 01:29:21,982
They brought it on themselves.

1071
01:29:22,059 --> 01:29:26,257
I must say, whoever he was, he's got balls,
fighting all those Asashi sect guys.

1072
01:29:26,697 --> 01:29:29,222
I wish we had someone like him
in our sect, huh?

1073
01:29:29,634 --> 01:29:30,896
Yes.

1074
01:29:31,102 --> 01:29:36,472
We can't ask them to chop their fingers
off under these ludicrous circumstances.

1075
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:38,438
Boss.

1076
01:29:38,643 --> 01:29:40,304
We're very sorry.

1077
01:29:41,145 --> 01:29:43,238
What are we going to do?

1078
01:29:44,081 --> 01:29:48,711
If it ends up in a war between us and the
Asashi sect, we'll be on the losing end.

1079
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:58,026
Boss, would you please
leave this to me?

1080
01:29:58,362 --> 01:30:00,023
What are you talking about?

1081
01:30:00,197 --> 01:30:03,166
Daimon, we're not
going to attack them.

1082
01:30:03,401 --> 01:30:06,632
Even if we try negotiating with them, with
you there, everything will end up in a mess.

1083
01:30:18,349 --> 01:30:22,513
Daimon...I'll leave this to you.

1084
01:30:22,687 --> 01:30:23,915
B...but Boss...

1085
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:27,352
Narita, calm down.

1086
01:30:27,692 --> 01:30:30,855
The Boss has made up his mind.
Just shut up.

1087
01:30:31,095 --> 01:30:32,790
Just wait and see.

1088
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:40,159
Listen, I'm going to leave the operations
of our sect to you. Do whatever you want.

1089
01:30:40,705 --> 01:30:46,507
I'll sort things out later.
Don't worry, alright?

1090
01:31:21,012 --> 01:31:23,412
Thank you for coming.

1091
01:31:36,627 --> 01:31:39,790
Excuse me?
How about one of these flowers?

1092
01:31:40,498 --> 01:31:41,829
Tight bastard!

1093
01:32:33,517 --> 01:32:35,417
Hey, Daimon!

1094
01:32:37,888 --> 01:32:39,253
What do you want?

1095
01:32:41,459 --> 01:32:49,230
These two are the ones who interfered
in your business the other day.

1096
01:32:49,834 --> 01:32:52,735
So that was you two punks!

1097
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:55,033
Have you brought your fingertips?

1098
01:32:55,139 --> 01:32:56,436
You're not understanding me.

1099
01:32:56,707 --> 01:33:02,805
Keep out of this! If you wanna negotiate,
do it once the goods are in our hands.

1100
01:33:04,882 --> 01:33:08,841
I'm the delegate responsible
for the negotiations.

1101
01:33:10,254 --> 01:33:12,017
What do you mean?

1102
01:33:12,723 --> 01:33:17,490
Let's come to an
understanding right now!

1103
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,267
Dynamite...!

1104
01:33:25,069 --> 01:33:30,268
You know, I don't like
anything complicated.

1105
01:33:30,474 --> 01:33:35,741
My position is to light the dynamite
and die together with you.

1106
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,281
What? What?
Have you gone mad?!

1107
01:33:39,517 --> 01:33:41,542
I'm dead serious.

1108
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:46,854
This is going to sort it all out.

1109
01:33:50,928 --> 01:33:52,088
Boss!
That's bullshit!

1110
01:33:52,596 --> 01:33:53,722
He's serious.

1111
01:33:56,033 --> 01:33:59,935
I'm deadly serious.

1112
01:34:02,106 --> 01:34:07,772
Let's come to an understanding. We
don't want any compensation or fingers!

1113
01:34:07,945 --> 01:34:10,709
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sure!

1114
01:34:12,416 --> 01:34:14,281
- Boss!
- For fuck's sake!

1115
01:34:14,952 --> 01:34:20,083
You two! Why don't you
say thank you to the Boss.

1116
01:34:20,824 --> 01:34:21,916
Thank you very much.

1117
01:34:30,234 --> 01:34:32,566
That's better, huh?

1118
01:34:33,571 --> 01:34:34,799
Captain!

1119
01:34:35,072 --> 01:34:38,564
I won't forget what you did for us
for the rest of my life.

1120
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:41,202
Shall we go home?

1121
01:34:41,545 --> 01:34:42,375
Yes!

1122
01:34:43,414 --> 01:34:46,542
Ah...Captain...

1123
01:34:47,818 --> 01:34:53,950
You mean this? It's fake dynamite.
I told Kinoshita to make it.

1124
01:34:54,592 --> 01:34:59,586
He didn't go to university for nothing.
It's good stuff.

1125
01:35:02,633 --> 01:35:05,067
I see...

1126
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:15,772
Ah...l must've left the dynamite
out like this...dangerous...

1127
01:35:20,651 --> 01:35:25,020
This is the fake dynamite I made...

1128
01:35:27,091 --> 01:35:28,752
Oh shit!

1129
01:35:29,193 --> 01:35:33,289
I gave him the real one!

1130
01:35:33,864 --> 01:35:35,456
It's real!

1131
01:35:38,269 --> 01:35:41,466
Kinoshita!

1132
01:35:42,873 --> 01:35:45,398
Thank you very much.
Please come again.

1133
01:35:45,542 --> 01:35:48,238
- We certainly will.
- Please do.

1134
01:36:00,524 --> 01:36:01,786
What?

1135
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:07,024
It's too late for fireworks. Whoever he is,
he must be celebrating something special.

1136
01:36:07,364 --> 01:36:09,127
OK, let's go.

1137
01:36:37,061 --> 01:36:46,436
Kaizo Daimon, Osaka's biggest yakuza,
will not die easily!

1138
