1
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,420
How did we end up here?

2
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,393
This place is horrible.

3
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,185
Smells like balls.

4
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:32,073
We don't belong in this shithole.

5
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,667
Shit.

6
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,046
Hey, Sam.

7
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,836
Dad, what kind of... shut up!

8
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,493
What kind of flowers did you want?

9
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,427
Alchemillas.
Or something that smells nice.

10
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,720
- Something soothing.
- It all smells like fucking kimchi!

11
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,847
That looks nice. Anything but roses.

12
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,733
I hate this job.

13
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,293
Riggan, everyone's set for 1-4.
They're ready for you.

14
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,297
Riggan, they're ready for you.

15
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,503
- Mr. Thomson.
- Steve.

16
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,843
- It's Daniel.
- Okay.

17
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,461
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

18
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,298
Pretty good. Yeah, I'd be a lot better
if I could get...

19
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,385
Ralph to stop, you know, acting.

20
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,809
He'll be fine.

21
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,570
And he was yelling, "I
love you, I love you,

22
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:29,122
bitch!" What do you do
with a love like that?

23
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,899
That's not love and you know it.
Why do you insist on calling it love?

24
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,943
Say what you want,
but I know what it was.

25
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,646
What about you, Nick?
Does that sound like love?

26
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,736
Sorry I'm late. Sound like love...

27
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:45,453
Look, I'm the wrong person to ask. I only
heard the man's name mentioned in passing.

28
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,544
I wouldn't know.
You'd have to know the particulars.

29
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,373
I think you're saying love is absolute.

30
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,961
Yeah. The kind of love
I'm talking about is...

31
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,053
The kind of love I'm talking about,
you don't try and kill people.

32
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,838
It was love, Mel. To Eddie, it was.
I don't care what anyone says.

33
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,135
He was ready to die for it.

34
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,928
Ask her what he did after she left him.

35
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,846
He shot himself in the mouth,
but he screwed that up, too. Poor ed.

36
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,941
Poor Ed, my ass! The guy was dangerous!

37
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,440
How did he screw up
shooting himself in the mouth?

38
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,362
He used to carry this .22.
We lived like fugitives then.

39
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,185
Ralph, Ralph, Ralph.

40
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,410
Fugitives are scared, you know?
Fugitives are on the run.

41
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,994
Can you give me more of that?
You know, fear?

42
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,486
Great idea.

43
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,212
We lived like fugitives then.

44
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:33,042
I never knew if he was going to come out
from behind a bush,

45
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,787
or a car, and just start shooting.

46
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:38,297
The man was crazy!
He was capable of anything!

47
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,303
Christ, what a nightmare.

48
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,380
He'd call me at the hospital and say:

49
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:46,391
"Son of a bitch, your days are numbered!"

50
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,518
Too much? It's a little bit too much.

51
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,191
I can tell, because you...
I just want to give you a range.

52
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,438
Call 911!

53
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,017
Is he breathing?

54
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,358
Is blood coming out of his ear?

55
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,402
Where are you going?

56
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:05,157
- Did someone call 911?
- Do not move him! Wait for an ambulance!

57
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,239
Well, that's a fucking lawsuit.

58
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,576
Where are you going?
The understudy'll be here.

59
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,830
Forget the understudy.
Cancel the first preview.

60
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,424
- But it's a full house! We'd
have to refund... - just do it.

61
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,461
- How's Ralph?
- He'll be fine.

62
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,344
Wait. Will you fucking wait?

63
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,799
Jake, it would have been a disaster.
That guy's the worst actor I've ever seen.

64
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,217
Bleeding's the most honest thing
he's done so far.

65
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,552
He's not that bad!

66
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,385
Okay, he's fucking terrible.

67
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,017
You have the press in your dressing room
in a few hours.

68
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,483
I'll make something up.
I'll think of something, riff. Hold on.

69
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,483
That wasn't an accident.

70
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,572
What do you mean?

71
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,495
I made it happen.

72
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,067
Oh, okay.

73
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,662
Are you drunk?

74
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,287
Just find me an actor... a good actor.
Woody Harrelson!

75
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,075
He's doing the next hunger games.

76
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,584
Michael Fassbender.

77
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,457
He's doing the prequel
to the X-Men prequel.

78
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,712
- How about Jeremy Renner?
- Who?

79
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:05,046
Jeremy Renner! He was nominated.
The hurt locker guy.

80
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,632
He's an avenger.

81
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,717
Fuck! They put him in a cape, too?
I don't care.

82
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,426
Just find me someone.

83
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,481
Ralph will sue us.
He will sue us and he has a case.

84
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,694
Just make it go away.

85
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,169
Look, you're my attorney.
You're my producer.

86
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,724
You're my best friend.

87
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,409
Now go out there
and do what you were born to do.

88
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,702
How do you suppose I do that? How...

89
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,542
next, an exclusive interview
with Robert Downey, Jr...

90
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:42,004
who's busy following up his
billion-dollar iron man franchise...

91
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:46,086
with the equally successful
avengers series.

92
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,480
That clown doesn't have half your talent...

93
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,769
and he's making a fortune
in that tin man get-up.

94
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,570
We were the real thing, Riggan.

95
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,744
We had it all.

96
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,373
We gave it away.

97
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,953
Breathing in.

98
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,367
We handed these poseurs
the keys to the kingdom.

99
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,623
Breathing out.

100
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,576
You listening to me?

101
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,754
Breathing in, I embrace my anger.

102
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,130
Yeah, embrace it.

103
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,552
But I'm not going away.
You know I'm right.

104
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,200
Look at that.

105
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:03,001
These people don't know
what you're capable of.

106
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:14,184
Why would somebody go from playing
the lead in a comic book franchise...

107
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:18,556
to adapting Raymond carver
for the stage?

108
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,194
As you're probably aware, Barthes said:

109
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,859
"The cultural work done in the past
by gods and epic sagas...

110
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,824
"...is now being done
by laundry detergent commercials...

111
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,658
"...and comic strip characters."

112
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,906
This is a big leap you've taken.

113
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,253
Yeah, it is. Absolutely. Absolutely.

114
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,663
Like you said...

115
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,042
that Barthes said...

116
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,462
Birdman, like Icarus...

117
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,625
okay, hang on. Who is this Barthes guy?
Which Birdman was he in?

118
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,216
Roland Barthes was a
French philosopher, and

119
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:55,741
if you knew anything
about the history of...

120
00:09:56,013 --> 00:10:00,023
now is it true you've been injecting
yourself with semen from baby pigs?

121
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,843
- I'm sorry, what?
- As a method of facial rejuvenation?

122
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,348
Where did you read that?

123
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,688
It was tweeted by @prostatewhispers.

124
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,188
- That's not true.
- I know, but did you do it?

125
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,805
- No, I didn't do it.
- Okay, I'll write you're denying it.

126
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,281
Don't write anything.
Why would you write anything?

127
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,080
Don't write what she said.
I didn't put any baby pig...

128
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,075
Are you at all afraid that people will say
you're doing this play...

129
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,286
to battle the impression
you're a washed-up superhero?

130
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,588
No, absolutely not. That's why...

131
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,680
twenty years ago,
I said no to Birdman 4.

132
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,683
Birdman 4? You do Birdman 4?!

133
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:42,266
Thank you for coming out. Thank you.
We're expecting some great pieces.

134
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,648
The guys in publicity...

135
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,903
want a times feature,
which is the worst idea right now.

136
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,055
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to look at this anymore.

137
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,115
That was a present from the crew.
Don't fuck with them... they're union.

138
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,696
I don't care.

139
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,658
- How'd it go?
- Good.

140
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,916
They talk about Ralph? He did it.
The motherfucker did it.

141
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,252
Threatened to sue us.

142
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:11,876
- What'd you say?
- Me?

143
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,534
I said, "motherfucker,
are you threatening me?

144
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,829
If I so much as get a
letter from a lawyer...

145
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,684
"...the press is getting pictures
off your computer."

146
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,223
What pictures?

147
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,525
He has a thing for nuns in diapers.

148
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:28,735
Why do you care?
Point is, I made it go away.

149
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,359
That's great.

150
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,941
Yeah, it's fantastic, except for one thing.

151
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,360
We have no actor. And if we cancel the
preview, the press will smell blood.

152
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,741
We can't afford to lose any more money.

153
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,485
What do you think I should do?

154
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,365
- We hired an understudy. Use him.
- No.

155
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,795
Riggan, listen to me.
Please, for the love of God, listen.

156
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,558
Our perfect dream actor is not going
to knock on that door and go,

157
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,749
"hey, fellas, when do I start?"

158
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,546
- Can I talk to you?
- What's up?

159
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,724
- You find another actor?
- No.

160
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,048
- Mike's available.
- Mike who?

161
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,386
- I thought he was doing the thing...
- He quit. Or got fired.

162
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,484
Mike who?

163
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,879
- Which is it, quit or fired?
- With Mike, it's usually both.

164
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,485
- Mike fucking who?
- Shiner.

165
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,983
- Yes!
- Jake.

166
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:14,405
- How do you know Mike shiner?
- We share a vagina.

167
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:15,745
You think he'd do it?

168
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,737
- How do you know?
- He told me.

169
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,199
- Jake.
- Yes. Ask me if he sells tickets.

170
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,613
Does he sell tickets?

171
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,568
A shitload. Ask me if the
theater critics love him.

172
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,419
- Do theater critics love him?
- They want to spooge on him.

173
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,674
- Right on his face.
- Everything for a reason.

174
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,803
- You think he'd come in this evening?
- I'll call and find out.

175
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,634
I'll call his agent.

176
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,218
Amazing, amazing.

177
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,860
Annie? Clear the theater, send everyone
to dinner and give me some lights!

178
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,567
- We've got a put-in tonight.
- Who?

179
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,070
You'll find out.

180
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,869
Intimidating, isn't it?

181
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,050
You have any idea the people who have
walked on these boards before you?

182
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,260
Geraldine page. Helen Hayes.

183
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,645
Jason Robards. Marlon Brando.
And now Riggan Thomson.

184
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,812
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice, Mike.

185
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:30,234
This is what I do.
You wrote this adaptation?

186
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:31,771
I did, yeah.

187
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,022
And you're directing and starring.
That's ambitious.

188
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,482
Well, thanks.

189
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,070
Well, it's a good theater.

190
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,283
I can't speak for your play,
but... Let's do a little bit of it.

191
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,829
Oh, I didn't expect you
to just jump right in.

192
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,498
It's first preview tomorrow night.
Let's get to work.

193
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,619
Well, feel free to take the script up
until you feel comfortable.

194
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,286
No, let's just do some of it.

195
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,956
Take a look at page 20.

196
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,876
I'm good. I don't need it.

197
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,466
- I don't need the script. Give me a cue.
- What?

198
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,392
Feed me a line.

199
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,849
- Feed me a line.
- Okay.

200
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,485
Okay, let me think.

201
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,775
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.

202
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,938
I only heard his name
mentioned in passing.

203
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,898
You'd have to know the particulars.

204
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,107
But I think what you're saying
is love is absolute.

205
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,906
Is that what I'm saying?
Am I saying love is absolute?

206
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,914
Yes. Okay, yeah! The kind of love
I'm talking about is absolute.

207
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,920
The kind of love I'm talking about,
you don't try to kill people!

208
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,090
How do you know the lines?

209
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,094
It's a thing I have. I
don't know, it's a gift.

210
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,507
Come on. I've been helping Lesley
get off book for a month.

211
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,103
- These lines are right here.
- That makes sense.

212
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,013
That's good. Give me my cue again.

213
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,926
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.

214
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,937
I only heard his name
mentioned in passing.

215
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,520
You never know the particulars.
I think what...

216
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,358
- can I make a suggestion? Do you mind?
- No, not at all.

217
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:05,157
No, no, forget that. Just stay with me.

218
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:09,162
"I'm the wrong person to ask," he says,
but what's the intention?

219
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:13,083
Is he fed up with the subject?
Deflecting guilt over the marriage?

220
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,672
And here's the thing...
you have four lines after that

221
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,379
that all say the same thing.
"I didn't know him".

222
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:22,134
"I only heard his name mentioned
in passing." "I wouldn't know."

223
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:26,054
"You'd have to know the particulars."
"Particulars" sounds like my grandmother.

224
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,933
The point is, you don't know the guy.
We fucking get it.

225
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,977
Make it work with one line.
"I didn't even know the man". Right?

226
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,942
Wait... you know my lines, too?

227
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:41,784
Can we not get hung up on knowing lines?
Can we just work on this? Tear it apart?

228
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,530
So why don't you just give me that
same thing again, but cut it down. Try it.

229
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,022
I'm the wrong person to ask...

230
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,333
oh, no! That's the thing... "I'm the wrong
person to ask." I think it's, "fuck you".

231
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,039
"Fuck you. Don't put me on the spot."

232
00:15:55,122 --> 00:16:00,172
"Don't make me feel self-conscious about
my marriage while my wife is sitting..."

233
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,050
- Right there.
- "...Right there."

234
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,592
- Can I sit down for this?
- Yeah, sit. Good idea.

235
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,387
So just give it to me as a "fuck you".
Lay it on me.

236
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:09,972
Just do it. Give it to me.

237
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,724
- Well, I'm thinking.
- Fuck me hard. Just give it.

238
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,025
Come on! Just do it!

239
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:18,099
Hey, I'm the wrong person to ask!
I don't even know him. What's your point?!

240
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:21,605
- What's my point?
- Yeah, what are you saying? Spit it out!

241
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,072
You're saying what?
You're saying love is absolute.

242
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:29,992
Yes! Yes! The kind of love that
I'm talking about, it is absolute!

243
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:33,082
The kind of love that
I'm talking about, you don't...

244
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,446
you don't try to kill people.

245
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,253
Yeah. Good.

246
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,838
I don't know... what do you think, boss?
You want to do this with me?

247
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,635
What do you think?

248
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,546
Everybody's back.
Larry needs to see him for a fitting.

249
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,046
I'll take that as a yes.

250
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,426
So, who are you?

251
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,228
That's Sam, my daughter.

252
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,020
That's amazing. You don't look anything
like each other. What do you do?

253
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,693
She's my assistant. Works with me.

254
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:15,123
She does. Yeah. She can even sit or stay
or roll over, if you have any treats.

255
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,084
- Welcome aboard, Mike!
- Thank you, captain.

256
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,917
I'm Mike... Shiner.

257
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,421
I know who you are.

258
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:28,050
I saw you in hothouse at the Geffen.
You were great.

259
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,875
Thank you. Your ass is great.

260
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,888
Dude. Seriously?

261
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,178
That was just me...

262
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,483
Larry? Larry?

263
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,481
This is the theater, sweetheart.
Don't be so self-conscious.

264
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:42,902
He's here.

265
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,442
Thank the lord and pass the biscuits.
I finally have an actor to dress.

266
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,648
How are you, Larry?

267
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:50,178
Better now you're here.
Take off your clothes.

268
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,477
You're just going to stand there?

269
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,121
This is the theater, honey.
Don't be so self-conscious.

270
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:01,411
We have to start from scratch
with less than 24 hours.

271
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,168
Here. Try these...

272
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,753
holy shi...! Where are your underpants?

273
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,254
Under the bed at home, I think.

274
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:13,133
No. Okay, okay. Everything's too small.

275
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:14,722
You're not kidding.

276
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:19,137
Whoa. That's nice. Forgive him, Larry.
Mike's like my 5-year-old son.

277
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,623
Neither of them has clean underwear.

278
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,104
Or pubic hair, I imagine.

279
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,972
I can alter the suit,
but we're going to have

280
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:28,555
to make new trousers and shirts.
And underwear.

281
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,566
- What are you doing?
- Waiting on Larry.

282
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:32,992
I'm finished!

283
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,450
Then I'm just standing here
with my cock out.

284
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,372
Well, get dressed. Riggan's daughter is
hanging around... she might walk in here.

285
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:44,786
You haven't seen her. She's always around,
watching everyone, like little miss creepy.

286
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,589
I don't know if drugs fried her brain
or what...

287
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:51,258
but I don't want her running to her
father saying you showed her your junk.

288
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,340
Then we should ask her to leave.

289
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,763
Oh, God. Really?

290
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,553
- Sammy?
- It's Sam.

291
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,846
Sam... Lesley.

292
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:01,769
Listen, what I said...

293
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:05,059
don't worry about it. He's a handful, huh?

294
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,477
How do you always manage
to find a new way to humiliate me?

295
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,687
To be fair, you make it really easy.

296
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,198
What was she doing here?

297
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,318
- She brought me down.
- And stayed?

298
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,826
Well, she is a little... Something.

299
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,037
This is Broadway. And I'm here, finally.

300
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,919
Now, please, do me a favor,
I'm begging you... don't fuck it up!

301
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,293
Lesley.

302
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,917
Come here. Come here.

303
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,474
Play with my balls.

304
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,295
Don't do it.

305
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,470
Just sign it.

306
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,041
- Listen...
- No, you listen to me!

307
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,098
I can't afford to listen to you.

308
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,907
- I have to go shopping again.
- Just sew something, you old fuck!

309
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,120
Give him whatever he wants!

310
00:19:46,146 --> 00:19:47,832
It's four times what
we paid what's-his-name!

311
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,184
Go into the reserve.

312
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,961
It's gone! We spent it
on fog and fake trees...

313
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:53,276
It's a dream sequence.

314
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,358
- ... and dancing midgets!
- You can't say "midget" anymore.

315
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,856
The reserve is gone!

316
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,326
You didn't see what I just saw.

317
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,852
He's the actor we've been waiting for.

318
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:13,548
Come on. Just get the contract done.
Please, Jake. I'll get the money.

319
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,126
Okay, I'll do it.

320
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,219
Stop smiling. You're freaking me out.

321
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,931
Sorry. You're right.

322
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,271
Is it true? Shiner?

323
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,938
- Holy shit. When can I meet him?
- He's with Larry now.

324
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,309
- I'm going to Starbucks. Want anything?
- I'm good.

325
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,975
She has a great ass.
I have news for you, too.

326
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,397
Is it good or bad? 'Cause I really...

327
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,485
I missed my last two periods.

328
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,413
I think it's really happening.

329
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,197
Is that good or bad? Riggan!

330
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,409
It's good. It's great.

331
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,370
Say something else.

332
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,925
You sure it's mine?

333
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,760
Well, you know, there's you, there's Jake,
the masseur wore a condom...

334
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,970
yeah, I'm pretty sure it's yours.

335
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,344
Idiot.

336
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,390
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

337
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,561
Me, too.

338
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,613
You're not funny!

339
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,030
What? Hey, what?

340
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,382
First preview tomorrow.

341
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,014
Here we go.

342
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,428
I rode with him in the ambulance
to the hospital.

343
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,306
I will never get that image out of my head.

344
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:54,402
Right before he did it, his
eyes were so sad and lonely.

345
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:58,193
- Did you have to treat him?
- I didn't have to, but I did.

346
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:01,645
Music out. Cue 34, 35 ready.

347
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,872
He was in terrible shape. His head swelled
to twice the size of a normal head.

348
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,295
- He's good, huh?
- He's incredible.

349
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,503
I think he's drinking real gin.

350
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:11,664
What?

351
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,666
Ask Nick. I want you to ask Nick
if he thinks that's love.

352
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,554
Oh, honey, can't we just go to dinner?

353
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,630
Mel, don't get him started.

354
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:26,387
You don't know how he's been lately.
He's been depressed. I've been worried.

355
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,850
You've been what?

356
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,825
Let me tell you guys
something about real love.

357
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,292
I'll tell you something.

358
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:37,437
We all should be ashamed when we talk like
we know what we're talking about...

359
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,396
when we talk about love.

360
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,703
For God's sake, are you getting drunk?

361
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:43,664
I don't have to be drunk
to say what I think.

362
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:45,719
We're not drunk. We're
having a few drinks.

363
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:46,342
Exactly.

364
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,238
- You've had more than a few.
- What, are you counting?

365
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,326
Leave her alone. If you're not drunk,
don't talk like you are.

366
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,834
Shut up!

367
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:59,712
Do me a favor. For once in your life,
honest to God, shut up for a minute.

368
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,680
Anyway, like I was saying...

369
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,892
you want to know about real love,
there's this old couple...

370
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,517
had a car wreck, out on the interstate.

371
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:16,686
Some drunk kid
plowed his old man's pickup...

372
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,154
right into their camper.

373
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:24,535
By the time I got down to the hospital,
this kid, this fucking teenager, was dead.

374
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,369
So we took the old couple up to the O.R.

375
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:31,584
We worked like hell on them
through most of the night.

376
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:37,173
By the time we were done with them,
we just, you know...

377
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,754
wrapped them in full body casts.

378
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,513
Was depressed for the longest time.

379
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,432
Even after I said to
him, "your wife's going

380
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,871
to pull through", he
was still depressed.

381
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:59,522
So, I went up to the mouth hole
and I asked him.

382
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,610
And he told me it was
because he couldn't see her...

383
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,406
through the eyes. Couldn't see his wife.

384
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:11,994
Can you imagine?

385
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:16,537
I'm telling you, this guy's heart
was breaking because...

386
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:21,797
he couldn't turn his goddamn head
and just look at his goddamn wife.

387
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,632
Shit.

388
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,594
I mean, it was killing this guy.

389
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,505
I am so tired of this. Is this water?

390
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:29,967
It was killing him.

391
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:34,564
Did you replace my gin with water, man?

392
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,771
Mike, come on.

393
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,602
- "Come on," what?
- You're drunk.

394
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:42,187
Yes, I'm drunk. I'm supposed to be drunk!
Why aren't you drunk?

395
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,398
This is carver! He left
a piece of his liver

396
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,051
on the table each
time he wrote a page!

397
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:49,741
If I need to be drinking gin,
who the fuck are you to touch my gin?

398
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,622
You fucked with the period, you fucked
with the plot so you'd get the best lines.

399
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,582
Leave me the fucking tools that I need!

400
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:58,832
Come on, people, don't be so pathetic.

401
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,575
Stop viewing the world through
your cell phone screen!

402
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,651
Have a real experience!

403
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,801
Does anybody give a shit about the truth
other than me?

404
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,551
This set is fake, the bananas are fake.

405
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,802
There's nothing in this milk carton!
Your performance is fake.

406
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:15,217
The only thing that's real on this stage
is this chicken.

407
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,727
So I'm going to work with the chicken.

408
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,610
That was interesting.

409
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:23,858
Bring the curtain down.

410
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,646
That's good bird, man!

411
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:28,072
Get him out of here!

412
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:29,993
How do you want me to do that?

413
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:33,701
Hey, wait.

414
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,704
- I want him gone.
- No!

415
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:38,576
- We cannot do that!
- Of course we can! It's our show!

416
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:41,712
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

417
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,592
Get him the fuck out of my play.

418
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,207
It was a preview! Nobody gives a shit!

419
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:50,055
Nothing matters until that old bat from
the New York times comes opening night!

420
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:51,384
We're getting rid of him.

421
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:55,057
Shut up! Shut up and listen to me for once!

422
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,852
As soon as we announced he was taking over,
the advance doubled.

423
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:03,064
We can't afford to lose any more money
and we can't afford to lose Mike.

424
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:07,335
This is about being respected
and validated, remember?

425
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:08,922
That's what you told me!

426
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,739
That's how you got me into this shit!

427
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,906
Now, you're the director.
Get him under control.

428
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,122
Fuck.

429
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,747
This isn't the '90s anymore.

430
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,924
Your zipper's down.

431
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,091
Fuck.

432
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,678
You were really good, cabrón.

433
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,741
Out in front of the
theater in ten minutes!

434
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:49,885
Don't overthink it.

435
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,170
What the hell was going on up there?

436
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:07,711
I didn't know you were here tonight.

437
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:09,963
That guy's an asshole, huh?

438
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:11,924
What are you doing here?

439
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:15,137
Sam and I are going to grab a bite
after she's finished.

440
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,049
No, I mean here. Now.

441
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:20,346
Well, I know how much this means to you.

442
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,937
Thanks. I appreciate that.

443
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,941
So what's happening?

444
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,606
- With the play? You saw what.
- No. You and Sam.

445
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,823
You know, it's great.

446
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,816
It's the same.

447
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:37,414
- Do you talk to her?
- Yeah, we talk.

448
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,744
It's just been so crazy around here,
you know?

449
00:27:40,786 --> 00:27:43,826
- You understand where her head is at.
- Of course.

450
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:46,174
She's trying to stay away
from everything and everyone

451
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,920
that got her into rehab in the first place.

452
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:51,631
I know. I really do. I get it.

453
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,883
- That's all she's had, so she's confused.
- Yeah, I get it.

454
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:58,016
I know you're caught up
in all this stuff, but...

455
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:58,780
"Stuff"?

456
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:00,758
You know what I mean.

457
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:06,811
Riggan, you don't have to be a great father
right now. You just have to be one.

458
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,609
Oh, sorry.

459
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,864
How's that going?

460
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:15,948
I'd rather not talk about it.

461
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:17,658
You're drinking?

462
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,661
Yeah, I'm having a beer.

463
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,663
So...

464
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,826
what's going on with you?

465
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:29,878
Me?

466
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:35,218
Everything's the same, I guess.

467
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:38,717
I'm going back to teaching.

468
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,011
Oh, yeah?

469
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,847
I'm thinking of refinancing
the Malibu house.

470
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,770
What? I'm sorry.

471
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:51,440
- I'm thinking of refinancing...
- No, I heard you. I just need a second.

472
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,691
That's going to be Sam's house.

473
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,900
Why would you...? For this play?

474
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:01,912
I need the money.

475
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,872
Do you have any idea
how crazy that sounds?

476
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:09,075
What do you want me to say?
My health lasted longer than the money.

477
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,498
Go figure that out.

478
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,290
What's going on?

479
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,675
Riggan, look at me.

480
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:24,057
I got a chance to do something right.

481
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:30,056
I got to take it. I got to.

482
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:34,319
It's funny. I was sitting here,
waiting for you...

483
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,030
and all of a sudden,
I couldn't remember why we broke up.

484
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:45,123
You know,
the last time I flew here from L.A...

485
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:49,331
George Clooney was sitting
two seats in front of me...

486
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:52,958
with a nice pair of cufflinks
and that fucking chin.

487
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:57,552
We ended up flying through
this really, really horrible storm.

488
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:01,431
I mean, the plane was rattling and shaking.

489
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:05,514
And all the people on board are,
you know, crying.

490
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:08,521
I mean, crying. Praying, right?

491
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:13,942
I just sat there. They're
crying, I sit there.

492
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,777
And I'm thinking, "oh, boy...

493
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:20,152
"...the next morning,
when Sam looks at the paper...

494
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,779
"...it's going to be Clooney's face
on the front page, not mine."

495
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,787
You know? Boom.

496
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,800
Did you know Farrah Fawcett died
the exact same day as Michael Jackson?

497
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,590
Is that crazy?

498
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:57,017
Why did we break up?

499
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,727
Because you threw a kitchen knife at me...

500
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:02,987
and an hour later, were telling me
how much you loved me.

501
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:07,527
Just because I didn't like that ridiculous
comedy you did with Goldie Hawn...

502
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,616
did not mean I did not love you.

503
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:14,545
That's what you always do...
you confuse love for admiration.

504
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,229
It's your house... do
what you want with it.

505
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,779
Just be there for our daughter.

506
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:21,258
I will.

507
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,010
You're not Farrah Fawcett, Riggan.

508
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:31,023
We should have done that reality show...
the Thomsons.

509
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:32,231
Shut up.

510
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:33,749
- That would've been good.
- Shut up!

511
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:38,021
Crazy, druggy, wise-ass daughter,
milf-y wife with perky tits.

512
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,482
People would've wanted to see that.

513
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:42,776
- Shut up.
- More than this piece of shit.

514
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,111
Shut up!

515
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,695
- The sun bed is here.
- What does that mean?

516
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:54,123
It means there's a sun bed out there
being delivered to in here.

517
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,374
Who ordered a sun bed?

518
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:59,167
Mike. He said it's for his character...
part of his process and that shit.

519
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,711
He said he has to be a redneck.

520
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,545
Son of a bitch.

521
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,099
Let's go. Walk.

522
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:12,138
- Where are we going?
- To get you coffee.

523
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,894
- Did I do something to disrespect you?
- Not yet.

524
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,900
- I have a lot riding on this play.
- Oh, is that right?

525
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,819
Bullshit. They don't know you, your work.

526
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,241
They know the guy from the bird suit

527
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,991
who tells coy, slightly vomitous stories
on letterman.

528
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,822
Well, I'm sorry if I'm popular.

529
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,947
Popular? I don't give a shit.

530
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:35,623
Popularity is the slutty little cousin
of prestige, my friend.

531
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:38,206
Okay, I don't even know
what the fuck that means.

532
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,960
It means, my reputation is riding on this,
and that's worth a, a...

533
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,090
- A lot.
- A lot, exactly! Fuck you. Yes!

534
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:49,803
If this doesn't work out for you,
you fuck off back to your studio pals...

535
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:53,137
and dive back into that cultural
genocide you guys perpetrate.

536
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:54,972
A douchebag's born every minute!

537
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,598
That was P.T. Barnum's premise
when he invented the circus...

538
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:01,726
and nothing has changed. You guys
know if you crank out toxic crap...

539
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:04,185
people will line up and pay to see it!

540
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:07,074
But long after you're gone,
I'll be on that stage...

541
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:09,034
earning my living, baring my soul,

542
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:11,566
wrestling with complex emotions,
'cause that's what we do.

543
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:15,997
So that's what tonight was about?
You wrestling with complex emotion?

544
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:19,668
Tonight was about seeing if it's
even alive, if it can bleed.

545
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,210
This isn't a backlot, Riggan, this is
New York City. This is how we do things.

546
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,975
They have coffee here.

547
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:36,769
Thanks, Tommy.

548
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:38,229
They were laughing at us.

549
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Tonight they were laughing,
tomorrow they'll be tweeting. Who cares?

550
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:46,898
These are people who pay half price
to watch us rehearse. Stop caring.

551
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:49,396
This play's a drama. It's about...

552
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,656
- you don't know what the play's about.
- I do know.

553
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,278
No, you don't. That's
what previews are for.

554
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:59,618
That's why they call them previews. That's
where you figure out what the play is.

555
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,422
Okay, look, look. Listen to me.

556
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,130
You see the woman at the end of the bar?

557
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,332
The one who looks like
she licked a homeless man's ass?

558
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:09,507
Yeah.

559
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:14,104
All that matters is what she writes
about us in 500 words in the times.

560
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,599
- That's, uh...
- Tabitha Dickinson, yes.

561
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:20,385
The only opinion that matters
in New York theater is hers.

562
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:24,401
If she likes us, we run.
If she doesn't, we're fucked.

563
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:28,148
She does look like
she licked a homeless guy's ass.

564
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:32,665
Do me a favor. Don't get your panties in a
twist over a preview, like some rookie...

565
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,528
and don't tell me how to do my job.

566
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:39,077
This is my town and to be honest,
people don't give a shit about you here.

567
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:41,751
- You're Riggan Thomson, right?
- Sorry to interrupt.

568
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,672
Would you mind
having a picture with us here?

569
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:46,672
Would you mind?

570
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,457
The button's on the bottom.

571
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,430
- Who is this guy?
- He used to be Birdman.

572
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:01,637
Oh, you're such a doll. Thank you.
You're so sweet.

573
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,270
Handsome.

574
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:05,444
Okay, sweetheart, come on.

575
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,896
Are we good here?

576
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,316
I'm going to go home.

577
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:18,125
All right. See you tomorrow.

578
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:23,921
I want to know something.

579
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,497
Why Raymond carver?

580
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:34,091
I was a kid, in high school...

581
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:37,889
doing a play in Syracuse,
and he was in the audience.

582
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:41,475
And he sent this back afterwards.

583
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:44,685
A little note.

584
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:48,310
"Thank you for an honest performance.
Ray carver."

585
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:55,159
That's when I knew
I was going to be an actor. Right there.

586
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:00,955
What's so funny?

587
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:03,255
It's just on a cocktail napkin.

588
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,540
So?

589
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:07,384
He was fucking drunk, man.

590
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,336
You headed to Hollywood, Mike?

591
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:13,916
No.

592
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,512
Hollywood's heading here, tabby.

593
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:19,723
Good luck with that.

594
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:24,139
"A man becomes a critic
when he cannot be an artist...

595
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:28,234
"...the same way a man becomes an informer
when he cannot be a soldier."

596
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,192
That's Flaubert, right?

597
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:33,567
He's a Hollywood clown
in a lycra bird suit.

598
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:36,986
Yes, he is. But tomorrow night at 8:00...

599
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:39,991
he's going out on that stage
and risking everything.

600
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,196
What will you be doing?

601
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,463
Don't you ever worry that
I'll give you a bad review?

602
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:48,577
I'm sure you will...

603
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:51,421
if I ever give you a bad performance.

604
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:54,008
Miss Dickinson.

605
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:55,973
Mr. shiner.

606
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,501
What are you still doing here?

607
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,750
Nothing.

608
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,497
Your costumes
are hanging in your dressing room.

609
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,091
Oh, great. Great.

610
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,631
I got that coconut water you wanted.

611
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,470
If you want the face stuff,
it's not open till tomorrow. What?

612
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:27,845
I'm not sure that I said thank you.

613
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,350
For what?

614
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:33,444
Everything. You've been doing
a really good job, honestly.

615
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:36,982
I've been so preoccupied with all the...

616
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:42,324
Okay, well, I just wanted to say that.

617
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:47,913
What is that?

618
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,332
That smell.

619
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:53,124
What is it? Look at me. Look at me!

620
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:54,417
What? What?

621
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:57,921
You've got to be shitting me. Where is it?

622
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,882
Can we not do this, please?

623
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:02,508
Dad?

624
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:05,506
Where is it? I can't believe this.

625
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:11,305
- What is this?
- Chunky peanut butter.

626
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,312
This. This. What is that?

627
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:17,731
That's pot. Relax.

628
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,399
You know what I'm talking about.

629
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:24,488
Yeah, you! What else is new?

630
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,812
- Don't do that thing where you...
- Make it about me? Never!

631
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,405
I'm trying to do something important!

632
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,374
- This is not important!
- It's important to me!

633
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:36,538
Maybe not to you or your cynical friends
whose only ambition is to "go viral"...

634
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,960
but to me... God, this is my career!

635
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:44,128
It's my chance to finally do work
that means something.

636
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:46,426
That means something to who?

637
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:49,512
You had a career, dad,
before the third comic book movie.

638
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:53,142
Before people started to forget
who was inside that bird costume.

639
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:56,935
You are doing a play based on a book
written 60 years ago...

640
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,482
for a thousand rich old white people...

641
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:02,986
whose only concern is where to
have cake and coffee afterwards!

642
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,448
Nobody gives a shit but you!

643
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:08,201
And, let's face it, dad...

644
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:12,662
you are not doing this for the sake of art,
you're doing it to feel relevant again.

645
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,456
Well, guess what?
There's an entire world of people

646
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,462
who fight to be relevant every single day!

647
00:40:17,793 --> 00:40:19,593
And you act like it doesn't exist.

648
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:22,298
Things that are happening
in a place you ignore...

649
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:25,551
that has already forgotten about you!

650
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:30,558
I mean, who the fuck are you?!
You hate bloggers, you mock Twitter.

651
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:34,638
You don't even have a Facebook page!
It's you who doesn't exist!

652
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:39,437
You're doing this because you're terrified,
like the rest of us, that you don't matter.

653
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:42,531
And you know what? You're right!
You don't!

654
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:47,029
It's not important, okay?
You're not important... get used to it!

655
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,011
Dad.

656
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:15,291
In the days before Nick's depression
started to eat away at him...

657
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:19,289
he never knew I was pregnant,
and I never intended to tell him.

658
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:24,292
I guess we make choices in life,
and we choose to live with them.

659
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:26,705
Or not.

660
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,514
I didn't want that baby.

661
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:34,260
Not because I didn't love Nick, and not
because I didn't love the idea of it...

662
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:37,848
but just because I wasn't ready
to love myself.

663
00:42:39,685 --> 00:42:41,485
There's a distance to it all now.

664
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:45,075
A wistful distance,
underscored by a gentle breeze...

665
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:46,569
Actors in position.

666
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:47,729
And the sound of birds...

667
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:51,236
- Music out.
- ... Laughing at the whimsy of it all.

668
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,318
- Lesley?
- What?

669
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,240
I think I'm hard.

670
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:58,834
No, it's just sometimes you don't consider
other people's feelings.

671
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:01,921
No, no. I'm getting hard... feel that.

672
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:03,922
What?! You've got to be kidding.

673
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:06,671
- Let's really do it. Let's fuck.
- No, are you crazy?!

674
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:08,552
It'll be incredible! It'll be real.

675
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,050
Cut it out! I'm serious, Mike.

676
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,720
Don't call me Mike. Call me Mel.

677
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:15,296
Get off!

678
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:17,721
Terri! Terri!

679
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,731
Terri, I know you're in there!

680
00:43:20,893 --> 00:43:22,893
Get off me! Get off!

681
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:25,806
- Ed?
- Why?

682
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:28,148
- What are you doing here?
- Just tell me why.

683
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:30,567
Take it easy, okay? I know this is hard.

684
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:32,702
Shut up! Shut...

685
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:35,573
- shut up!
- Just don't do anything stupid.

686
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,372
Eddie, please!

687
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:43,582
What's the matter with me? Why do I
always have to beg people to love me?

688
00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:45,959
Eddie, please, give me the gun.

689
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:47,786
Look at me.

690
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:51,171
I was drowning. I'm just not capable of...

691
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:56,144
you deserve to be loved, Eddie. You do.

692
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:58,763
I just wanted to be what you wanted.

693
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:03,351
Now I spend every fucking minute praying
to be somebody else. Somebody I'm not!

694
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:04,729
Anybody.

695
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:08,772
Just put the gun down, ed.
She doesn't love you anymore.

696
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:10,819
You don't, do you?

697
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:12,194
No.

698
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:15,449
And you never will.

699
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:17,454
I'm sorry.

700
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,450
I don't exist.

701
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:25,252
I'm not even here.

702
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:30,877
None of this even matters.
I don't exist. I don't exist.

703
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:34,474
- Ed...
- I don't exist.

704
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,802
Ed! Eddie, Eddie, don't do that!

705
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:47,808
You're such an asshole!

706
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,900
What? That's the best you've been.

707
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,480
Why would you do that?!
We were onstage!

708
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:55,356
What the fuck?!
It's like my head was a jar of Bolognese!

709
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:57,276
I'll fix the blood rig.

710
00:44:57,698 --> 00:44:59,488
They're fucking in a motel room.

711
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:01,421
You can't get it up in
six months and now you

712
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:02,893
want to fuck me in front
of 800 strangers?!

713
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:06,291
I need it to feel real, okay?
I need that intensity.

714
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:14,708
I was in the moment. I thought
you were, too. I'm sorry.

715
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:17,882
I told you to stop, you fucking animal.

716
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,350
You were brilliant.

717
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,679
What is wrong with you?!

718
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:43,912
I want your shit out of the apartment.

719
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:48,118
What? Hey, no, wait. Look, look, I'm sorry.
Can we just...

720
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,920
no, we can't, Mike!
Maybe up here, you're Mr. truth...

721
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:55,006
but in the real world, where it counts,
you're a fucking fraud!

722
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,340
How's that for truth, you dick?!

723
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,509
- What's wrong?
- He's an asshole.

724
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:01,644
What'd he do now?

725
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:03,805
Nothing, just try to fuck me
in front of the audience!

726
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,309
- Oh, my God!
- Right?

727
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,769
That's kind of hot!

728
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:15,146
Why don't I have any self-respect?!

729
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,567
You're an actress, honey.

730
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,566
I'm pathetic!

731
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:22,952
Look at me.

732
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:31,791
You know, I've always dreamed
of being a Broadway actress...

733
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:35,586
since I was a little kid.
And now I'm here, and I'm...

734
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:40,554
I'm not a Broadway actress,
I'm still just a little kid.

735
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:46,968
And I keep waiting for someone to tell me
I made it.

736
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:50,556
You made it.

737
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:53,774
I did?

738
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:58,276
Sadly, it was with Mike shiner
on a fake motel bed in front of 800 people.

739
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,030
Shut up.

740
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:08,042
- Hey, is she okay?
- She'll be fine.

741
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:13,418
Look, none of this is your fault, okay?

742
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:17,629
You're beautiful and you're talented...

743
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,630
and I'm lucky to have you.

744
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:22,678
Okay?

745
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:24,587
Okay.

746
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:37,857
That was kind of sweet.

747
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,235
Yeah.

748
00:47:41,528 --> 00:47:42,948
What's wrong?

749
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:48,034
Nothing. Two years, and he's never said
anything like that to me.

750
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:55,036
You're beautiful and you're talented...

751
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:58,839
and I'm lucky to have you. Okay?

752
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:00,634
We're gross.

753
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:02,134
We are.

754
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,809
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

755
00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:25,659
Do it again.

756
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,456
Can we discuss this like
two mature artists?

757
00:48:35,482 --> 00:48:37,065
What is the big deal about...

758
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:38,879
fuck you!

759
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:44,669
You're not ready yet. That's fine.

760
00:48:51,223 --> 00:48:53,023
Fuck. Actresses.

761
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,643
They drive me fucking crazy.

762
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:58,022
Riggan?

763
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:04,284
Your gun is ridiculous.
I can see the red plug in the barrel...

764
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:08,411
so you look like a kid with a
plastic toy when you point it at me.

765
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:11,699
I don't feel threatened at all.

766
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,713
Get a better one. Have some self-respect.
Please.

767
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,088
Hey, apart from that, uh...

768
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:23,091
I thought it was a
pretty fun crowd, huh?

769
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:45,942
I don't think it's high enough.

770
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,742
Me, neither.

771
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,163
What are you doing up here?

772
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:55,542
Adrenaline.

773
00:49:56,246 --> 00:50:00,666
I just got out of rehab.
It's the closest thing I get to a drug.

774
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:02,668
You went to rehab?

775
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:05,464
Cool.

776
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:11,091
It wasn't all Dr. drew or anything,
but that dude from American pie was there.

777
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:12,428
Jump!

778
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:14,141
Eat me!

779
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:16,516
Okay, then jump on my face!

780
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,099
I love this city.

781
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:21,147
Yeah?

782
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:29,201
Why do you act like a dick all the time?
Do you just do it to antagonize people?

783
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:31,992
Maybe.

784
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:35,077
You really don't give a shit
if people like you or not.

785
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,790
Not really.

786
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:40,169
That's cool.

787
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:43,172
Is it? I don't know.

788
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,214
What?

789
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:51,762
- Let's play a game.
- A game? What are you, eight?

790
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:53,757
What are you, 78?

791
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,177
- Truth or dare.
- Oh, come on.

792
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:58,105
Truth or dare?

793
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:00,352
Truth.

794
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:07,361
When we first met,
you made a comment about my ass.

795
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:09,615
Why did you do that?

796
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:15,415
You have a terrific ass,
and I noticed that.

797
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:18,044
And I just commented on it.

798
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,830
- Truth or dare?
- Dare.

799
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:23,829
- Really?
- Yeah.

800
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,224
- No.
- You said dare.

801
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:36,933
- Truth.
- No, it's too late.

802
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,188
- Happy?
- Yeah.

803
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,280
Truth or dare?

804
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,245
- Truth.
- You're boring.

805
00:51:53,572 --> 00:51:55,572
The truth is always interesting.

806
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,287
You want to fool around with me?

807
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:04,248
No.

808
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,460
Really?

809
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:08,377
Why not?

810
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,670
- That's a second question.
- It's a second part.

811
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:16,853
I'd be afraid I couldn't get it up.

812
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:24,271
That didn't seem to be a problem for you
onstage.

813
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:29,856
Nothing is a problem for me onstage.

814
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:34,316
- I want to ask another question.
- You already did.

815
00:52:34,404 --> 00:52:36,494
- One more.
- Go ahead.

816
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:42,505
If you weren't afraid,
what would you want to do to me?

817
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:50,495
I'd pull your eyes out of your head...

818
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:52,508
That's sweet.

819
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,510
And put them in my own skull...

820
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:59,892
and look around, so I could see the street
the way I used to when I was your age.

821
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,440
Good night.

822
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:09,206
Don't kill the messenger.

823
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,997
He's an asshole.

824
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:14,795
I told you.

825
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,375
You fucking prick.

826
00:54:16,715 --> 00:54:18,125
He's playing you.

827
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:19,465
This is it?

828
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:22,968
Page 12. Page 12.

829
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:27,946
"Riggan Thomson, best
known as the face of

830
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:30,582
Birdman, tries not to lay
an egg on Broadway."

831
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:33,306
- Where's the rest of it?
- There is no rest of it.

832
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:36,321
Don't worry... it'll be used
to scoop up dog shit tomorrow.

833
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:39,610
- How can you be so calm?
- What are my other choices?

834
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:42,367
- Aren't you scared at all?
- About what?

835
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,237
About being humiliated out there!

836
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:46,536
It won't be the first time
I've been humiliated.

837
00:54:46,828 --> 00:54:48,328
Well, of course it won't.

838
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:53,631
You're an asshole.

839
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:04,721
And by the way, I'm not pregnant,
so there's one thing not to worry about.

840
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:10,233
Forget about her.

841
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:15,821
He stole your front page. He's stealing
your show. He thinks you're a joke.

842
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:19,896
Now two million people agree with him.

843
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:25,195
Maybe you are, Riggan.
Maybe that's what you are... a joke.

844
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,683
Whoa! What the hell is going on?

845
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:48,466
- Get up!
- Ow! That hurts!

846
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:50,175
- Get up!
- Back away!

847
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:52,197
So carver's the reason
you became an actor?

848
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,309
Listen, this is my fucking show.

849
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:57,689
I did the work, I raised the money
and I arrange the press!

850
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:02,035
Oh, Jesus. They called me for an interview.

851
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:05,572
I told them the first thing
that came into my head.

852
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:09,541
- We got the cover of the arts section!
- Fuck the arts section!

853
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:13,038
You told them the first thing
that came into your head? Right.

854
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:16,793
You're Mr. natural. Mr. fuck-the-scene-
just-stare-at-my-massive-hard-on.

855
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:17,877
That's truth.

856
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:19,082
You think it looked massive?

857
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:22,969
Shut the fuck up. You don't get hard
on my stage unless I tell you to.

858
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,513
Your stage? Let me tell you something.

859
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:30,022
This stage has belonged to a lot of great
actors, but you are not one of them.

860
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:31,929
So you wrote your own lines, huh?

861
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:33,521
I did, actually.

862
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:36,347
You wrote a few changes and mumbled,
you self-absorbed prick.

863
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,806
I'm self-absorbed? Look at you.

864
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:39,485
You nobody piece of shit!

865
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:42,776
Nobody? My massive hard-on
got 50,000 views on YouTube.

866
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,660
A cat playing with a dildo
gets more than that.

867
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,569
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do! You care.

868
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:50,411
- I'm a theater actor.
- I don't give a shit. You care.

869
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:54,662
Everybody says, "oh, Mike is so honest.
Mike is so motherfucking truthful!"

870
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:59,594
You said in the interview your father
was a drunk like carver. Is that true?

871
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:01,878
- No. No.
- 'Cause my father was.

872
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:05,224
My father was a mean fucking drunk.
You understand?

873
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:09,469
He beat the shit out of us.
But at least when he was beating us...

874
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:13,395
he wasn't thinking about
taking us out to his toolshed.

875
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,557
Because when he got us out there...

876
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:17,558
that bastard would smile and say:

877
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:20,445
"You want to get on your knees
and unbuckle my belt,

878
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:22,606
"or do I take it off and use it on you?"

879
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:26,455
After a while, I made myself numb,
so... but my...

880
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:28,242
my little sister...

881
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:32,835
Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

882
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:35,459
Oh, God.

883
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,036
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

884
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:42,669
That's fucking horrible, man. I'm sorry.

885
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:47,683
It's also not true. See,
I can pretend, too.

886
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:49,588
Don't fuck with me, Mike.

887
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:52,637
You're a little bit crazy.
You should start using that onstage.

888
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:56,101
"Working with Riggan Thomson's
like waltzing with a monkey"?

889
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:59,445
- I might have said that.
- You might? Come on, let's go.

890
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:01,315
- Come on.
- Yeah.

891
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:04,070
Why don't you get your wings
and your bird suit?

892
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:18,539
I'm gonna crab up on your ass
and fucking choke you out!

893
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,674
Get off me. What are you looking at?

894
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:25,549
What are you going to do, replace me?!
Get fucking Ryan gosling or some shit?!

895
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:27,883
What do you think my
friend Tabitha will do

896
00:58:27,909 --> 00:58:29,956
to you in the times, you
fucking dilettante!

897
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,318
You are lame, Riggan...

898
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:55,911
rolling around with that
poncy theater fuck...

899
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:59,213
in an 800-seat shithole like this.

900
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:08,761
Oh, you really fucked up this time.

901
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:12,894
You destroy a genius book
with that infantile adaptation.

902
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:17,313
Now you're about to destroy
what's left of your career.

903
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:19,677
It's pathetic.

904
00:59:19,977 --> 00:59:21,597
Breathing in, I am calm.

905
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:27,943
I ignore this mental formation.
This is a mental formation.

906
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,945
Stop that shit!

907
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:33,742
I'm not a mental formation.
I'm you, asshole.

908
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:38,245
- Leave me alone.
- You were a movie star, remember?

909
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,789
- Pretentious, but happy.
- I wasn't happy.

910
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:45,671
Ignorant, but charming.
Now, you're just a tiny, bitter cocksucker.

911
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,962
I was fucking miserable.

912
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:51,975
Yeah, but fake miserable.
Hollywood miserable.

913
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:55,724
What are you trying to prove?
You're an artist? You're not.

914
00:59:56,138 --> 01:00:00,138
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you, you coward.

915
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,149
We grossed billions!
You're ashamed of that? Billions!

916
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:08,573
And billions of flies eat shit every day!
So what? Does that make it good?

917
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:13,201
I don't know if you noticed,
but that was 1992!

918
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:16,624
You could jump right back into that suit,
if you wanted to.

919
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:20,623
Oh, look at me! Look at this!
Look, look, look!

920
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:23,207
I look like a Turkey with leukemia!

921
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:25,834
I'm fucking disappearing.

922
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,710
This is what's left! I'm the answer to
a fucking trivial pursuit question!

923
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:34,756
You're an imposter here.
Eventually they will figure you out.

924
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:37,677
What part of this don't you get?
You're dead.

925
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,971
- We are not dead.
- Oh, please, just stay dead.

926
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:42,728
We are not dead.

927
01:00:42,768 --> 01:00:45,188
Stop saying "we!" There is no "we!"

928
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:49,191
I'm not fucking you!
I'm Riggan fucking Thomson!

929
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:52,646
No, you're Birdman.

930
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:57,238
Because without me, all
that's left is you...

931
01:00:57,658 --> 01:01:00,448
a sad, selfish, mediocre actor...

932
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:04,459
grasping at the last vestiges
of his career.

933
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:13,837
What the hell did you do that for?
I liked that poster.

934
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,680
It's always "we," brother.

935
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,350
Fuck you! Shut the fuck up!

936
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:34,277
You're fucking, so fucking annoying!
Shut up!

937
01:01:41,493 --> 01:01:42,873
Hey. What's up?

938
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:44,623
Um, well...

939
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:47,867
one hour till curtain.
Why don't you rest a bit?

940
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:50,502
Yeah, I'm going to lay down.

941
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:53,508
- Almost there, buddy. Last preview.
- Okay. Cool.

942
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,039
- How you doing?
- Good. Great.

943
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:58,799
The money came through. I just need
to transfer it into the account.

944
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:00,264
Good. That's terrific.

945
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,889
So... I'll go, uh, do that.

946
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:04,393
Thanks for stopping by.

947
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:11,269
You know I'm proud of you, don't you?

948
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:14,531
This took balls.

949
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:17,113
- And you did it, okay?
- I know.

950
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:20,316
I think we should cancel the preview.

951
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:24,913
I'm tired, dude.
I can't do this anymore, Jake.

952
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:27,333
I can't.

953
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:31,667
That's a joke, right?

954
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:36,553
You know, I don't think this is for me.
The whole...

955
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:38,883
They're laughing at me.

956
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:43,886
There is a three-block line of people
waiting for you.

957
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:48,307
It's a full house. We're sold out!

958
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:50,902
- Really?
- Yes!

959
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:53,233
And the French ambassador's coming.

960
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:56,357
The prince of Saudi Arabia's
bringing one of his wives.

961
01:02:56,777 --> 01:03:00,357
And I didn't want to tell you this,
but Martin Scorsese...

962
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:03,948
is casting his new film, and...
Don't tell anybody.

963
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:06,368
- No, I won't.
- Okay?

964
01:03:07,162 --> 01:03:08,088
Okay?

965
01:03:08,114 --> 01:03:11,817
Okay. Yeah, yeah, I can be ready.
I can be ready.

966
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:13,789
- Good.
- Thank you.

967
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:19,093
How is he?

968
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:21,512
He'll be fine.

969
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:22,887
Poor creature.

970
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,800
Is it true? Scorsese?

971
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:27,887
Yeah. And the new pope, too.

972
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:31,268
You're an asshole, Jake!

973
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:34,269
I'm the one keeping this afloat!

974
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:54,878
Are you okay?

975
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:58,338
Yeah. Yeah. I think I cut my hand shaving.

976
01:03:59,548 --> 01:04:02,758
Well, I just wanted to say... I'm sorry.

977
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,086
What for?

978
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:09,019
I knew what Mike was capable of
and I brought him in anyway.

979
01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:13,308
No, no, no. You did good.
Are you kidding? You did great.

980
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:18,937
Tomorrow's my first opening night
on Broadway.

981
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:20,361
Mine, too.

982
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:25,160
And I just want to let you know that,
no matter what happens...

983
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:27,946
I'm really grateful to you.

984
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:30,085
No, no, no. Me, too.

985
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:33,003
This is exciting.

986
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:36,999
We have a full house. Jake just told me.

987
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:40,804
Yeah, it's great.

988
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:50,018
Oh, God.

989
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:18,036
For fuck's sake, just jump already.

990
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:21,051
How'd you know I'd be up here?

991
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,880
Well, I didn't know,
but I kind of hoped maybe.

992
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:28,434
Where is Lesley?

993
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:32,847
Lesley? Uh, Lesley's moving on.

994
01:05:34,226 --> 01:05:36,056
Smart girl.

995
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:39,153
Thank you. I appreciate that support.

996
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:43,285
You ready for your last preview?

997
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:45,152
Sure, yeah.

998
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:46,907
Who did that to you?

999
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:51,284
Could have been anybody, I guess.

1000
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:52,912
Yes.

1001
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:55,498
I'm sort of hoping it was Lesley.

1002
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,080
It wasn't Lesley.

1003
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:03,132
Oh, my God.

1004
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:05,507
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

1005
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,049
Jesus Christ!

1006
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:12,262
I think maybe I deserved it.

1007
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:15,676
Fuck.

1008
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:18,689
Fuck.

1009
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:21,685
Tell me something.

1010
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:26,737
What is the worst thing that he did to you?
Seriously.

1011
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:28,954
He was never around.

1012
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:32,953
Yeah? I mean, so what? That was it?

1013
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:36,958
No. It was how he tried
to make up for it...

1014
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:41,247
by constantly trying to convince me
that I was special.

1015
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:51,093
Okay. Look.

1016
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:53,297
Look at me.

1017
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:56,105
He was right, though.

1018
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:59,734
- About what?
- About your being special.

1019
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:03,733
You've been hanging around here...

1020
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:08,571
trying to make yourself invisible behind
this fragile little fuck-up routine...

1021
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:10,157
but you can't.

1022
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:13,371
You're anything but invisible. You're big.

1023
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:16,156
You're kind of a great mess.

1024
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:19,998
It's like a candle burning at both ends,
but it's beautiful.

1025
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:24,998
No amount of booze or weed or attitude
is going to hide that.

1026
01:07:30,801 --> 01:07:35,141
I'm glad you're an actor and not a writer,
'cause that was, like...

1027
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:38,175
Oprah...

1028
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:40,771
hallmark...

1029
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:43,097
r. Kelly bad.

1030
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:44,556
Yeah, well, I wasn't...

1031
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:09,213
truth or dare?

1032
01:08:10,048 --> 01:08:12,258
- Truth.
- No.

1033
01:08:16,597 --> 01:08:18,807
- Truth.
- No.

1034
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,230
Truth or dare?

1035
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,876
Do you have any idea where you're going?

1036
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:48,801
Absolutely not.

1037
01:08:58,055 --> 01:08:59,645
How do you do it?

1038
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:02,061
Do what?

1039
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:04,562
Go out there every single
night and pretend to

1040
01:09:04,588 --> 01:09:07,007
be somebody else in front
of all those people?

1041
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:10,281
I don't pretend out there. I told you.

1042
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:14,112
I pretend just about every place else,
but not out there.

1043
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:16,283
That's a shame.

1044
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:19,915
What are we doing here?

1045
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,331
What do you mean?

1046
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,500
I mean, what are we doing here?

1047
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:38,886
By the time we got to the hospital,
the kid was dead.

1048
01:09:39,304 --> 01:09:43,104
So we took the old couple up to the O.R.

1049
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:46,307
We worked like hell on them...

1050
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:49,105
through most of the night.

1051
01:09:50,148 --> 01:09:54,738
The husband, the old man,
was depressed for the longest time.

1052
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:58,743
Even after I told him the wife would
pull through, he was still depressed.

1053
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:03,747
So I went up to the mouth hole
and I asked him.

1054
01:10:05,539 --> 01:10:09,539
And he told me it was
because he couldn't see her...

1055
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,340
the wife, through the eye holes.

1056
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:16,971
Can you imagine? I'm telling you,
this guy's heart was breaking...

1057
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:22,354
because he couldn't turn his
goddamn head to see his goddamn wife.

1058
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:23,931
So...

1059
01:10:24,308 --> 01:10:28,308
I guess the question
we should ask ourselves is...

1060
01:10:29,354 --> 01:10:32,944
what do we talk about
when we talk about love?

1061
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:47,795
Mel and I had been together five years...

1062
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:50,313
and I don't know how
many times I've heard "I

1063
01:10:50,339 --> 01:10:52,528
love you," but it wasn't
until that night...

1064
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:56,424
The blood rig should be good now.
Be ready to go in two minutes.

1065
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:58,378
That was amazing!

1066
01:10:58,717 --> 01:11:00,337
Yeah, good, right?

1067
01:11:03,347 --> 01:11:04,757
It's actually going well.

1068
01:11:05,182 --> 01:11:06,392
Yeah.

1069
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:12,485
- I think we need to talk.
- No, no.

1070
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:14,613
Yeah, I guess you're right...

1071
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:17,185
but we will eventually,
because that's the

1072
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:19,557
only way I'll get a
chance to say I'm sorry.

1073
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,820
I really am sorry.

1074
01:11:22,824 --> 01:11:24,414
We'd have made great parents.

1075
01:11:24,743 --> 01:11:27,333
- Horrible. We'd have been...
- ...Awful. We'd have raised...

1076
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:30,041
- ...a serial killer.
- Or Justin Bieber.

1077
01:11:32,626 --> 01:11:34,626
I really wanted to be a mom.

1078
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,050
But my body doesn't seem to agree.

1079
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:47,929
When I imagined myself on Broadway,
I never saw the dancing reindeer.

1080
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:49,395
Nice touch.

1081
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:58,652
In the days before Nick's depression
started to eat away at him...

1082
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:00,856
he had no idea I was pregnant...

1083
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:03,875
and I never intended to tell him.

1084
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:08,081
I guess we make choices in life,
and we choose to live with them.

1085
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:09,655
Or not.

1086
01:12:10,497 --> 01:12:12,077
I didn't want that baby.

1087
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:15,102
Not because I didn't love
Nick, and not because

1088
01:12:15,128 --> 01:12:17,488
I didn't love the idea
of it, but because...

1089
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:21,512
I just wasn't ready to love myself.

1090
01:12:23,093 --> 01:12:25,393
There's a distance to it all now.

1091
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:29,393
Hey, Jimmy, you got a smoke?

1092
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:28,582
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1093
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:29,742
Jimmy!

1094
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,378
Shit!

1095
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:39,962
Fuck!

1096
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:47,586
Fuck.

1097
01:13:56,728 --> 01:14:00,568
Hey, aren't you Riggan Thomson?
Holy shit, let me get an autograph.

1098
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:02,784
Don't be a dick. Give me an autograph.

1099
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:04,487
Dude, you rock!

1100
01:14:04,778 --> 01:14:06,198
Birdman!

1101
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,200
Oh, shit!

1102
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:16,581
Oh, my God! You know who that is?

1103
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:20,208
Oh, can we take one picture!

1104
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:23,207
Just one picture! Kids, get next to him!

1105
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,800
You suck!

1106
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:26,795
You suuuuck!

1107
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:30,177
Hey, Birdman!

1108
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:39,599
Riggan, I'm missing him.

1109
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:42,771
It's the bird-fucking-man!
Hey, come look at this guy!

1110
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:46,823
Birdman!
Hey, Birdman, whooo, look at that!

1111
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,541
Where you going, man?

1112
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:58,039
You look so old in person.

1113
01:14:58,457 --> 01:14:59,827
Fuck you!

1114
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:06,262
Sir! Sir! Where are you going?

1115
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:09,260
Sir! Where are you...? Sir!

1116
01:15:09,676 --> 01:15:10,707
What are you doing?

1117
01:15:10,733 --> 01:15:13,661
Waiting for Jake. This
is my attorney, Mr. Roth.

1118
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:16,602
We're pursuing financial remunerations
for the injuries...

1119
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:18,354
I got a play to do!

1120
01:15:18,644 --> 01:15:20,234
Sir, you can't go in there!

1121
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:23,436
Actors equity is a very strong union, sir!

1122
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:37,697
Knock, knock, knock! Terri! Terri!

1123
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,081
Ed?

1124
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:42,419
What are you doing here?

1125
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:45,206
Why?! I just need you to tell me why?

1126
01:15:45,504 --> 01:15:47,094
Take it easy, ed. I know this is hard.

1127
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:49,012
Shut up! Fuck you! Shut up!

1128
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:50,299
Shut up!

1129
01:15:50,634 --> 01:15:52,094
Eddie, please!

1130
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,471
What's wrong with me?!

1131
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:02,691
Why do I always... Beg people to love me?

1132
01:16:02,855 --> 01:16:06,655
Eddie, please, just...
Just give me the gun.

1133
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:10,735
I just wanted to be what you wanted.

1134
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:14,324
Now I spend every fucking day...

1135
01:16:14,741 --> 01:16:16,741
trying to be somebody I'm not!

1136
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:19,247
Put the gun down. She doesn't love you!

1137
01:16:19,913 --> 01:16:20,913
Eddie.

1138
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:24,131
Look at me. I was drowning.

1139
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:27,341
I'm just not capable of that kind of...

1140
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:30,920
you deserve to be loved, Eddie. You do.

1141
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:33,341
I just wanted to be what you wanted.

1142
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:36,099
Mr. Roth? Okay, don't leave, please.

1143
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:38,313
Is that a threat? What wheelchair?

1144
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:41,524
Okay, Mr. Roth, please hear me out.
Will you?

1145
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:44,022
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

1146
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:48,903
Give me 10 minutes to grab my things, give
me 10 minutes and we can... don't hang up.

1147
01:16:49,568 --> 01:16:51,948
Goddamn it! The motherfucker hung up!

1148
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:42,411
Dad.

1149
01:17:44,414 --> 01:17:45,834
Dad!

1150
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:49,005
- Are you... Okay?
- Why?

1151
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:52,015
You seem sort of...

1152
01:17:52,297 --> 01:17:54,417
No, I'm good, I'm good.

1153
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:56,716
This is good. You want some?

1154
01:17:56,802 --> 01:17:58,012
No.

1155
01:17:59,763 --> 01:18:03,183
Do you really think you'll be ready
for opening tomorrow?

1156
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,770
Yeah. Yep.

1157
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:08,813
Yeah, well, I mean...

1158
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:13,821
previews were pretty much a train wreck. We
can't seem to get through a performance...

1159
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:18,823
without a raging fire or a
raging hard-on. I'm broke.

1160
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:22,041
I'm not sleeping, like, you know... At all.

1161
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:27,042
And, uh, this play
is kind of starting to feel like...

1162
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:31,667
a miniature, deformed version of myself
that just keeps...

1163
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,837
following me around and, like...

1164
01:18:34,464 --> 01:18:38,474
hitting me in the balls with, like,
a tiny little hammer.

1165
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:42,010
I'm sorry, what was the question?

1166
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,851
Never mind.

1167
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:45,888
Tonight wasn't bad.

1168
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:48,813
- I know.
- It was weird, but it was kind of cool.

1169
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:51,859
- Yeah, really?
- Yeah, I think people liked it.

1170
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:55,068
What are you doing? Homework?

1171
01:18:55,485 --> 01:18:56,895
No, I don't...

1172
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:00,070
no, um... when I was in rehab,
they made us do this.

1173
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:01,565
Really? What is it?

1174
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:06,909
These dashes represent the six billion
years that the earth has been around.

1175
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:10,294
So, each dash represents a thousand years.

1176
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:15,014
And this... Is how long
humans have been here.

1177
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:17,923
150,000 years.

1178
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:21,123
I think they're trying
to remind us that that's

1179
01:19:21,149 --> 01:19:23,071
all our ego and
self-obsession are worth.

1180
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:29,853
I was a shitty father, wasn't I?

1181
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,860
No, you were...

1182
01:19:35,526 --> 01:19:36,896
You were fine.

1183
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,950
That's right, I was... I was just fine.

1184
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:45,736
I can't...

1185
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:47,036
Dad?

1186
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:49,545
Oh, shoot. I'm sorry.

1187
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:53,001
You just wiped out the entire human race.

1188
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:56,341
There it goes. I'm sorry.

1189
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:02,432
You're becoming a trending topic.

1190
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:03,851
Really?

1191
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:08,725
I should probably tell you about this
before anybody else does.

1192
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:15,944
350,000 views in less than an hour.

1193
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:18,986
Fuck.

1194
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:24,163
Believe or not, this is power.

1195
01:20:28,996 --> 01:20:30,786
Hey, look, it's Riggan Thomson!

1196
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:32,786
Look at that!

1197
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:36,088
One million, three hundred thousand hits
in the last 2 hours.

1198
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,960
That's Birdman actor Riggan Thomson.

1199
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:39,885
Give me another one.

1200
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:41,681
You got it.

1201
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:43,179
That takes a lot of balls.

1202
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:45,258
- Or not.
- Ouch!

1203
01:20:45,596 --> 01:20:47,636
What do you have to do
to get a job these days?

1204
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:50,143
Why must actors have to resort to this?

1205
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:53,773
That's going over to Ms. Dickinson.

1206
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:55,977
Give me a minute.

1207
01:21:00,194 --> 01:21:03,824
Hey, that's on me. She's a friend of mine.

1208
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:06,028
Okay. No problem.

1209
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,410
Thank you.

1210
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:19,955
That was...

1211
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,380
twenty years
before I put on that goddamn outfit.

1212
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:25,087
I don't care.

1213
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:29,564
Okay. I was just...

1214
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:33,143
You know,
before you come tomorrow night.

1215
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:34,937
It doesn't matter.

1216
01:21:38,607 --> 01:21:40,817
I'm going to destroy your play.

1217
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:45,407
But you didn't even see it.
Did I do something to offend you?

1218
01:21:45,739 --> 01:21:47,319
Actually, you did.

1219
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:51,946
You occupied a theater which might have
been used on something worthwhile.

1220
01:21:53,205 --> 01:21:57,425
Okay. But you don't even know
if it's any good or not.

1221
01:21:57,835 --> 01:22:02,055
That's true. I haven't read a word of it,
or even seen a preview...

1222
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:03,724
but after the opening tomorrow,

1223
01:22:03,799 --> 01:22:07,219
I'm going to turn in the worst review
anybody has ever read.

1224
01:22:08,011 --> 01:22:09,971
And I'm going to close your play.

1225
01:22:10,806 --> 01:22:12,386
Would you like to know why?

1226
01:22:13,016 --> 01:22:17,016
Because I hate you,
and everyone you represent.

1227
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:20,976
Entitled, selfish, spoiled children.

1228
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:25,647
Blissfully untrained, unversed
and unprepared...

1229
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,071
to even attempt real art.

1230
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:32,040
Handing each other awards
for cartoons and pornography.

1231
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:35,039
Measuring your worth in weekends?

1232
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:37,254
Well, this is the theater.

1233
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:41,043
You don't get to come here and pretend
you can write, direct and act...

1234
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:45,168
in your own propaganda piece
without coming through me first.

1235
01:22:46,258 --> 01:22:48,128
So break a leg.

1236
01:22:50,512 --> 01:22:55,482
Wow. So what has to happen in a person's
life for them to become a critic, anyway?

1237
01:22:56,268 --> 01:22:58,058
What are you writing, a review?

1238
01:22:58,478 --> 01:23:00,058
Is it any good?

1239
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,900
Is it bad? Did you even see it?
Let me read it.

1240
01:23:04,234 --> 01:23:05,335
I will call the police.

1241
01:23:05,361 --> 01:23:07,849
No, you won't. Let's
read your fucking review.

1242
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:10,535
"Callow." Callow is a label.

1243
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:13,545
"Lackluster." That's just a label.

1244
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:18,752
"Marginalia"? Are you kidding me? It sounds
like you need penicillin to clear that up.

1245
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:22,536
That's a label, too. These are all labels.
You just label everything.

1246
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:27,131
That's so fucking lazy.
You're a lazy fucker.

1247
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:28,759
You're a lazy...

1248
01:23:29,176 --> 01:23:32,176
do you know what this is?
Do you even know what it is?

1249
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:38,181
Because you can't see this thing
if you don't know how to label it.

1250
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:42,399
You mistake those noises in your head
for true knowledge.

1251
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:44,273
- Are you finished?
- No.

1252
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:47,148
There's nothing in here about technique,
about structure...

1253
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:50,864
about intention.
It's just a bunch of crappy opinions...

1254
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:54,198
backed up by even crappier comparisons.

1255
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:57,198
You write a couple paragraphs,
and you know what?

1256
01:23:57,246 --> 01:24:00,366
None of this costs you fucking anything.

1257
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:04,208
You risk nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

1258
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:06,378
Well, I'm a fucking actor.

1259
01:24:10,008 --> 01:24:12,178
This play cost me everything.

1260
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:17,141
So I'll tell you what.
You take this fucking...

1261
01:24:17,558 --> 01:24:19,978
malicious, cowardly...

1262
01:24:20,143 --> 01:24:24,563
shittily written review
and you shove it right the fuck up...

1263
01:24:25,023 --> 01:24:28,613
your wrinkly... Tight ass.

1264
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:37,615
You're no actor, you're a celebrity.
Let's be clear on that.

1265
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:46,042
I'm going to kill your play.

1266
01:25:18,452 --> 01:25:20,292
Tomorrow...

1267
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:23,869
and tomorrow...

1268
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,675
and tomorrow,

1269
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:30,885
creeps in this...

1270
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:35,301
petty pace...

1271
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:38,264
from day to day...

1272
01:25:40,057 --> 01:25:43,057
to the last... Syllable...

1273
01:25:45,062 --> 01:25:47,232
of recorded time;

1274
01:25:49,316 --> 01:25:50,686
and...

1275
01:25:51,902 --> 01:25:55,702
all of our yesterdays...

1276
01:25:57,491 --> 01:25:59,331
have lighted...

1277
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,115
fools...

1278
01:26:04,498 --> 01:26:06,328
A pint of whiskey, please.

1279
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:08,595
The way to dusty death.

1280
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:12,344
Out... Out...

1281
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:15,295
$6.50, my friend.

1282
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:17,137
$6.50.

1283
01:26:19,137 --> 01:26:21,677
Here... I don't know what that is,
just take it.

1284
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:23,893
But your...

1285
01:26:24,476 --> 01:26:27,306
life is but a walking shadow,

1286
01:26:29,147 --> 01:26:30,727
a poor...

1287
01:26:31,316 --> 01:26:32,726
player...

1288
01:26:33,944 --> 01:26:38,534
that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage...

1289
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:41,156
and then is heard...

1290
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:43,749
no more!

1291
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:45,961
It is a tale...

1292
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:50,171
told by an idiot...

1293
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:54,376
full of sound and fury...

1294
01:26:55,382 --> 01:26:59,392
signifying nothing!

1295
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:05,353
Where you going, man?
Was that too much?

1296
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:07,726
I was just trying to give you a range.

1297
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:10,520
It's a little bit too much.
I can tell, because you...

1298
01:27:10,546 --> 01:27:12,045
I just want to give you a range.

1299
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:15,569
That was a little too much.
It was a little too much.

1300
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:13,254
God, you look like shit, brother.

1301
01:28:13,627 --> 01:28:17,257
You get that mongoloid look
when you're hung over.

1302
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:22,470
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

1303
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:24,645
It's a beautiful day.

1304
01:28:25,222 --> 01:28:29,432
Forget about the times...
Everyone else has.

1305
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:32,018
Come on. Stand up!

1306
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:38,228
So you're not a great actor. Who cares?
You're much more than that.

1307
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:42,283
You tower over
these other theater douchebags.

1308
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:44,277
You're a movie star, man!

1309
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:47,286
You're a global force! Don't you get it?

1310
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:51,789
You spent your life building a bank account
and a reputation... and you blew 'em both.

1311
01:28:52,082 --> 01:28:53,212
Good for you.

1312
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,143
Fuck it. We'll make a comeback.
They're waiting

1313
01:28:56,169 --> 01:28:58,535
for something huge.
Well, give it to them.

1314
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:02,217
Shave off that pathetic goatee.
Get some surgery!

1315
01:29:02,509 --> 01:29:04,679
Sixty's the new thirty, motherfucker.

1316
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:08,772
You're the original. You paved the way
for these other clowns.

1317
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:12,437
Give the people what they want...
old-fashioned apocalyptic porn.

1318
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:14,769
Birdman: The Phoenix rises.

1319
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:17,273
Pimple-faced gamers
creaming in their pants.

1320
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:22,239
A billion worldwide, guaranteed!
You are larger than life, man.

1321
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:25,529
You save people
from their boring, miserable lives.

1322
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:28,489
You make them jump, laugh,
shit their pants.

1323
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:30,827
All you have to do is...

1324
01:29:41,548 --> 01:29:43,928
that's what I'm talking about.

1325
01:29:44,343 --> 01:29:46,933
Bones rattling! Big, loud, fast!

1326
01:29:47,346 --> 01:29:50,466
Look at these people, at their eyes...
they're sparkling.

1327
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:54,186
They love this shit. They love blood.
They love action.

1328
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:59,110
Not this talky, depressing,
philosophical bullshit.

1329
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,160
Yes.

1330
01:30:08,575 --> 01:30:11,155
And the next time you screech...

1331
01:30:12,538 --> 01:30:16,168
it'll explode into millions of eardrums.

1332
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:20,752
You'll glimmer on thousands of screens
around the globe.

1333
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:23,591
Another blockbuster.

1334
01:30:24,383 --> 01:30:26,553
You are a God.

1335
01:30:27,177 --> 01:30:30,557
See? There you go, you motherfucker.

1336
01:30:30,722 --> 01:30:33,142
Gravity doesn't even apply to you.

1337
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:37,153
Wait till you see the faces of those
who thought we were finished.

1338
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:41,607
Listen to me. Let's go back one more time
and show them what we're capable of.

1339
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:46,574
We have to end it on our own terms...
With a grand gesture.

1340
01:30:46,864 --> 01:30:49,704
Flames. Sacrifice.

1341
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:51,619
Icarus.

1342
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:53,792
You can do it.

1343
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:55,624
You hear me?

1344
01:30:55,998 --> 01:30:56,998
You are...

1345
01:30:57,207 --> 01:30:58,577
Birdman!

1346
01:31:03,005 --> 01:31:07,015
Hey! Is this for real,
or are you shooting a film?

1347
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:10,215
A film!

1348
01:31:10,596 --> 01:31:13,176
You people are full of shit!

1349
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,560
Hey, man, can I help you?

1350
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:18,849
Be careful.

1351
01:31:19,188 --> 01:31:21,558
Sorry, I can't talk. I'm late.

1352
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:23,611
Music.

1353
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:29,450
You okay, man?

1354
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,450
You want me to call somebody for you?

1355
01:31:35,454 --> 01:31:36,834
Do you know where to go?

1356
01:31:40,834 --> 01:31:41,924
Yeah.

1357
01:31:42,836 --> 01:31:44,246
I know where to go.

1358
01:32:30,259 --> 01:32:31,679
You see?

1359
01:32:32,636 --> 01:32:34,966
This is where you belong.

1360
01:32:38,809 --> 01:32:40,639
Above them all.

1361
01:33:42,706 --> 01:33:45,746
- Stop the music.
- I beg your pardon?

1362
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:48,126
Sir, you did not pay me!

1363
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:51,915
What are you doing? Where are you going?

1364
01:33:52,341 --> 01:33:55,141
This guy didn't pay me. He's fucking crazy!

1365
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,170
- Not a bad first act, huh?
- Not bad at all.

1366
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:33,716
It's going really well.

1367
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:35,967
I didn't think he could do Broadway.

1368
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:37,833
I never would have expected it.

1369
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:39,390
If the 2nd act is half as good...

1370
01:34:39,805 --> 01:34:41,145
It's pretty glorious.

1371
01:34:41,348 --> 01:34:43,549
What do we talk about when we talk about
Riggan Thomson?

1372
01:34:43,559 --> 01:34:44,719
How long is the intermission?

1373
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:46,353
Birdman can act.

1374
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:13,962
It's going great out there. You're so good.
I mean it. I really mean it.

1375
01:35:14,006 --> 01:35:17,006
Places for the final scene, Riggan.

1376
01:35:17,342 --> 01:35:18,127
Do you need to...?

1377
01:35:18,153 --> 01:35:20,247
No, it's fine. Just
sit here for a second.

1378
01:35:20,554 --> 01:35:22,564
Look at all these roses.

1379
01:35:22,806 --> 01:35:25,176
- I hate roses.
- And you hate roses.

1380
01:35:27,186 --> 01:35:29,396
Are you okay? You seem...

1381
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:33,400
I don't know, you seem abnormally calm.

1382
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:36,824
I am calm.

1383
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:39,861
I'm great, actually.

1384
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:47,788
I got this little voice...
Talks to me sometimes.

1385
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:49,870
Tells me the truth.

1386
01:35:50,042 --> 01:35:51,462
It's comforting.

1387
01:35:51,835 --> 01:35:53,835
Kind of scary, but it is comforting.

1388
01:35:54,463 --> 01:35:57,031
I'm going to pretend I
didn't hear you say that.

1389
01:35:57,057 --> 01:35:57,798
Okay.

1390
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:00,505
You wouldn't believe the
crowd outside. They

1391
01:36:00,531 --> 01:36:02,875
said some people paid
up to $500 a ticket.

1392
01:36:03,472 --> 01:36:04,642
Really?

1393
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:10,225
Can I tell you something funny?

1394
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:14,019
Remember our last anniversary party?

1395
01:36:14,066 --> 01:36:16,498
Seriously? You want
to ruin a nice moment?

1396
01:36:16,524 --> 01:36:17,711
Do you remember?

1397
01:36:18,028 --> 01:36:21,408
- You fucked Janet Rossbach in our bed.
- Skip over that part.

1398
01:36:21,698 --> 01:36:22,698
Gladly.

1399
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:25,125
You threw all the guests
out of the house and

1400
01:36:25,151 --> 01:36:27,311
you threw all the
furniture out the window.

1401
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:29,422
- I remember.
- Locked yourself in the bathroom.

1402
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:31,078
Why are we talking about...?

1403
01:36:31,416 --> 01:36:32,826
I drove out to...

1404
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:34,630
Malibu.

1405
01:36:35,504 --> 01:36:39,304
I just sat on the beach for a while,
looking out at the ocean.

1406
01:36:39,633 --> 01:36:40,633
Riggan.

1407
01:36:40,926 --> 01:36:42,506
And I walked...

1408
01:36:42,928 --> 01:36:44,718
straight into the water.

1409
01:36:49,685 --> 01:36:51,695
And then I tried to drown myself.

1410
01:36:56,942 --> 01:36:59,322
I was up to my chest
when I felt the first one.

1411
01:36:59,736 --> 01:37:02,190
On my back, it was like
somebody was holding

1412
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:04,341
a frying pan to me
and really burning.

1413
01:37:04,658 --> 01:37:08,038
And then they were on my chest
and all over my legs.

1414
01:37:08,912 --> 01:37:11,582
The water was full of jellyfish.

1415
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:15,001
They were all over me.

1416
01:37:15,085 --> 01:37:19,005
I had to fight my way out of the water
and went up to the beach.

1417
01:37:19,173 --> 01:37:22,803
I was rolling around like a maniac
in the sand...

1418
01:37:23,468 --> 01:37:24,888
crying.

1419
01:37:26,388 --> 01:37:28,348
You said it was a sunburn.

1420
01:37:29,558 --> 01:37:32,558
I know. And you believed me.

1421
01:37:32,936 --> 01:37:35,146
To be honest, I didn't give a shit.

1422
01:37:43,822 --> 01:37:44,992
I love you.

1423
01:37:49,036 --> 01:37:51,196
- And I love Sam.
- I know.

1424
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,630
I really wish I hadn't
videotaped her birth.

1425
01:37:58,045 --> 01:37:59,005
Why?

1426
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:00,421
'Cause...

1427
01:38:01,632 --> 01:38:03,632
I missed the moment, really.

1428
01:38:04,051 --> 01:38:07,851
I don't have it. I should have just
been there with the two of you.

1429
01:38:08,013 --> 01:38:12,023
You know... Just the three of us.

1430
01:38:15,187 --> 01:38:16,597
But I wasn't.

1431
01:38:16,897 --> 01:38:20,107
I wasn't even present in my own life,
and now I don't have it...

1432
01:38:20,234 --> 01:38:22,074
and I'm never going to have it.

1433
01:38:22,236 --> 01:38:25,236
- You have Sam.
- Not really, I don't. I mean, she's...

1434
01:38:25,656 --> 01:38:27,446
No, she's just going through...

1435
01:38:27,866 --> 01:38:31,446
no, I get it, I understand.
She needed to have a dad...

1436
01:38:31,745 --> 01:38:34,745
and instead she got
this guy who was a...

1437
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:41,336
There are things more pathetic than that.

1438
01:38:41,672 --> 01:38:44,052
- Yeah, like?
- That moustache.

1439
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:54,431
Riggan, we are in the motel.
Last scene has started. You're not here.

1440
01:38:54,852 --> 01:38:56,852
Last chance for "places".

1441
01:38:57,312 --> 01:38:59,232
You better get back to your seat.

1442
01:39:19,751 --> 01:39:24,341
Twenty little leopards
laughed at two lofty lions.

1443
01:39:24,756 --> 01:39:27,756
Twenty little leopards
laughed at two lofty lions.

1444
01:39:28,177 --> 01:39:32,177
Twenty little leopards
laughed at two lofty lions.

1445
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:05,629
Break a leg, Mr. Thomson.

1446
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:36,948
Let me put the blood rig on.

1447
01:40:42,876 --> 01:40:44,286
Riggan!

1448
01:40:53,887 --> 01:40:55,097
Terri!

1449
01:40:55,472 --> 01:40:56,642
Terri!

1450
01:40:57,724 --> 01:40:59,274
Eddie! What are you doing here?

1451
01:40:59,309 --> 01:41:02,229
Why? I just want you to tell me why.

1452
01:41:02,521 --> 01:41:04,651
- Shut up!
- Eddie, please!

1453
01:41:05,566 --> 01:41:07,146
What's the matter with me?

1454
01:41:07,484 --> 01:41:11,324
Tell me. Why do I always have to
beg people to love me?

1455
01:41:11,488 --> 01:41:13,318
Eddie, please, give me the gun.

1456
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:16,280
It was me. I was drowning.
I'm just not capable of...

1457
01:41:16,702 --> 01:41:20,122
you deserve to be loved, Eddie. You do.

1458
01:41:21,582 --> 01:41:25,292
I just wanted to be what you wanted.
What you wanted.

1459
01:41:25,586 --> 01:41:30,006
Now I spend every fucking minute trying
to be something else, something I'm not.

1460
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:33,510
Just put the gun down, ed.
She doesn't love you anymore.

1461
01:41:36,138 --> 01:41:37,718
You don't, do you?

1462
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:40,270
- No.
- And you never will.

1463
01:41:41,310 --> 01:41:42,480
I'm sorry.

1464
01:41:54,156 --> 01:41:55,316
I don't exist.

1465
01:41:59,161 --> 01:42:00,751
I'm not even here.

1466
01:42:02,164 --> 01:42:03,544
I'm not even here.

1467
01:42:04,208 --> 01:42:05,328
Bang!

1468
01:42:17,763 --> 01:42:18,763
Bang!

1469
01:44:12,669 --> 01:44:14,089
Is he up?

1470
01:44:14,421 --> 01:44:15,881
He just woke up.

1471
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:23,510
I thought I lost you, buddy.

1472
01:44:25,098 --> 01:44:26,638
What the hell happened?

1473
01:44:27,643 --> 01:44:30,443
I was watching you onstage
and all of a sudden...

1474
01:44:30,854 --> 01:44:34,074
you had that goofy look in your eye
and you just...

1475
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:35,961
What is wrong with you? He tried to...

1476
01:44:36,235 --> 01:44:40,455
I'm happy! He's alive!
My best friend is alive! And...

1477
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,030
he's the fucking man of the hour.

1478
01:44:43,325 --> 01:44:45,495
- What is that?
- You have to be shitting me.

1479
01:44:46,119 --> 01:44:47,119
Read it.

1480
01:44:47,454 --> 01:44:50,544
I don't believe this.
"The unexpected virtue of ignorance"?

1481
01:44:50,624 --> 01:44:51,624
Read it.

1482
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:54,705
- "By Tabitha Dickinson."
- Read it out loud!

1483
01:44:55,546 --> 01:45:00,336
"Thomson has unwittingly given birth to a
new form, which can only be described as...

1484
01:45:00,425 --> 01:45:02,335
"...super-realism.

1485
01:45:02,427 --> 01:45:04,451
"Blood was spilled
both literally and

1486
01:45:04,477 --> 01:45:06,872
metaphorically by artist
and audience alike.

1487
01:45:07,099 --> 01:45:08,519
"Real blood.

1488
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:13,230
"The blood that has been sorely missing
from the veins of American theater..."

1489
01:45:14,523 --> 01:45:16,523
You're happy about this?

1490
01:45:16,942 --> 01:45:18,902
Happy? I'm fucking euphoric!

1491
01:45:18,986 --> 01:45:21,546
This is the kind of review that
turns people into living legends!

1492
01:45:21,864 --> 01:45:23,454
He shot the nose off his face!

1493
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:28,160
He got a new nose! And if doesn't like
that one, we'll get him a new one!

1494
01:45:28,537 --> 01:45:30,537
We'll use Meg Ryan's guy. Who cares?

1495
01:45:30,831 --> 01:45:34,421
They're lighting candles for him
in central park. Turn on the TV.

1496
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:37,741
A vigil for actor Riggan Thomson.

1497
01:45:37,754 --> 01:45:40,174
They're praying for him
all over the country.

1498
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,409
He did it. You did it!

1499
01:45:42,384 --> 01:45:45,604
I've been reborn, brother.
And I can see the future.

1500
01:45:45,762 --> 01:45:49,812
This play is going to last forever.
It's going to open in London, Paris.

1501
01:45:50,142 --> 01:45:52,812
The studio will call, we're going
to get book deals... you'll see.

1502
01:45:56,773 --> 01:45:59,983
How about that, huh?
Did you see that coming?

1503
01:46:01,195 --> 01:46:02,785
Why aren't you saying anything?

1504
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,570
This is what you wanted, wasn't it?

1505
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,990
Riggan, this is what you wanted.

1506
01:46:10,204 --> 01:46:11,414
Yeah.

1507
01:46:11,622 --> 01:46:13,542
Yeah, this is what I wanted.

1508
01:46:13,582 --> 01:46:18,592
Okay, listen. You're going to get hit with
a "brandishing a weapon" charge.

1509
01:46:18,879 --> 01:46:21,509
If anybody talks to you about it,
it was an accident.

1510
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:23,430
Is that what this was?

1511
01:46:24,426 --> 01:46:26,426
- An accident?
- An accident.

1512
01:46:27,095 --> 01:46:28,416
Did you intend to shoot yourself!

1513
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:32,600
You motherfuckers, this is a hospital!
Get the fuck out of here!

1514
01:46:32,768 --> 01:46:34,978
This is a hospital!

1515
01:46:35,604 --> 01:46:38,194
Get the fuck out, you assholes!

1516
01:46:38,649 --> 01:46:43,649
Out! This is a personal matter!
A personal matter!

1517
01:46:45,322 --> 01:46:50,122
Hey, Sam! What did you feel like the
night your father tried to kill himself?

1518
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:18,440
Lilacs.

1519
01:47:26,864 --> 01:47:28,704
Are you laughing?

1520
01:47:28,866 --> 01:47:30,276
What's so funny?

1521
01:47:31,869 --> 01:47:33,699
I can't smell them.

1522
01:47:40,085 --> 01:47:40,853
What are you doing?

1523
01:47:40,879 --> 01:47:42,900
Posting a photo of you
on your Twitter page.

1524
01:47:43,172 --> 01:47:46,302
- I have a Twitter page?
- Yeah, I set it up today.

1525
01:47:46,758 --> 01:47:49,718
- Let me see.
- No way. You look hideous.

1526
01:47:49,761 --> 01:47:53,391
- Wow, thank you. I appreciate it.
- I'm just kidding.

1527
01:47:53,724 --> 01:47:56,064
No, I'm actually not. You do look hideous.

1528
01:47:57,477 --> 01:48:00,687
You got 80,000 followers
in less than a day.

1529
01:48:00,856 --> 01:48:03,266
- Really?
- I'm going to scare the shit out of them.

1530
01:48:03,734 --> 01:48:05,694
- Let me look at it.
- It's done.

1531
01:48:10,115 --> 01:48:12,695
I'm going to get a vase for the flowers.

1532
01:50:13,822 --> 01:50:16,242
Bye-bye... And fuck you.

1533
01:51:44,538 --> 01:51:45,538
Dad?

1534
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:48,751
Dad?

1535
01:51:50,335 --> 01:51:51,415
Dad?
