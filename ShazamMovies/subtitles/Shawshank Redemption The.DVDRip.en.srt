1
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,647
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,996
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,072
It was very bitter.

4
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,555
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,379
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:11,126
- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:14,359
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:17,754
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:20,341
If they say so.

10
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,250
I really don't remember.
I was upset.

11
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,850
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:28,663
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:29,788 --> 00:02:32,821
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:37,363
Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:40,563
...whom you had discovered
was your wife 's lover.

16
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:43,924
Did you follow her?

17
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:47,218
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:51,608
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:53,616
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:55,246
...and waited.

21
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,042
With what intention?

22
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,999
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:01,496
I was confused...

24
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:02,704
...drunk.

25
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:05,397
I think...

26
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:07,600
...mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:11,094
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,301
I was sobering up.

29
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:17,009
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,055
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,156
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:26,286
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,975
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,182
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:36,528
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:38,347
Yes, it does.

37
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,583
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:43,756
...before the murders took place.

39
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,096
That's very convenient.

40
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,886
It's the truth.

41
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:52,620
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:56,749
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:03:56,948 --> 00:04:00,243
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:03,185
And that also...

45
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:06,931
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:10,186
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:14,827
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:35,215
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence.

49
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:39,086
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

50
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:42,030
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

51
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:45,072
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

52
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:46,759
And most of all...

53
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,894
...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

54
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:52,038
...lying dead in each other's arms.

55
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,687
They had sinned.

56
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:59,268
But was their crime so great...

57
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:01,640
...as to merit a death sentence?

58
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,043
While you think about that...

59
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:07,146
...think about this:

60
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:11,560
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:15,303
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:18,185
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:19,363
No.

64
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:20,645
This was revenge...

65
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:25,100
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,594
Four bullets per victim.

67
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:29,959
Not six shots fired, but eight.

68
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:33,891
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

69
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:35,979
...and then stopped to reload...

70
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,520
...so that he could shoot
each of them again.

71
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:42,179
An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:44,614
...right in the head.

73
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:52,582
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:55,011
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:59,524
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:05:59,722 --> 00:06:03,813
...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,591
...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

78
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:31,808
Sit.

79
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,884
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,848
- Yes, sir.
- You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,726
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:48,731
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:53,060
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

84
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,434
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,516
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,574
Hey, Red.

87
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:38,013
How'd it go?

88
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,282
Same old shit, different day.

89
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,333
Yeah, I know how you feel.

90
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,438
I'm up for rejection next week.

91
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:47,606
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

92
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:49,053
It happens.

93
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:50,623
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

94
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:53,980
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

95
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,135
Four!

96
00:07:56,224 --> 00:07:59,519
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

97
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,435
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

98
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:04,598
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

99
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:08,094
...bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

100
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,326
Damn near anything within reason.

101
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:14,105
Yes, sir!
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

102
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:19,740
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

103
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:23,349
...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

104
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:25,720
...I told him, "No problem. "

105
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:07,954
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

106
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:11,895
...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

107
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,112
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

108
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:18,260
Good work for a man so young.

109
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,424
You speak English, butt-steak?

110
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:03,410
You follow this officer.

111
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:19,727
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

112
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:22,443
Hey, fish! Come over here!

113
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:46,095
Taking bets today, Red?

114
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,075
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

115
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:49,899
Smokes. Put me down for two.

116
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,911
All right, who's your horse?

117
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:53,804
That little sack of shit.

118
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:58,476
- Eighth. He'll be first.
- Bullshit! I'll take that action.

119
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,777
You're out some smokes, son.

120
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,667
If you're so smart, you call it.

121
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,830
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

122
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,519
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

123
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,225
Fresh fish today!

124
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,374
We're reeling them in!

125
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:19,527
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

126
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,829
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

127
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,190
That was my first impression of the man.

128
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,764
What do you say?

129
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,121
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

130
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:32,357
That guy? Never happen.

131
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,728
-10 cigarettes.
- That's a rich bet.

132
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:36,899
Who's going to prove me wrong?

133
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:38,824
Heywood? Jigger?

134
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:40,360
Skeets?

135
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:41,833
Floyd!

136
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,707
Four brave souls.

137
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:47,559
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

138
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:50,919
All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.

139
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:11,554
Turn to the right!

140
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:12,997
Eyes front.

141
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:28,032
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

142
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:30,240
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

143
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,545
You are convicted felons.

144
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,750
That's why they've sent you to me.

145
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:36,645
Rule number one:

146
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,269
No blasphemy.

147
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,055
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

148
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:43,393
The other rules...

149
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:46,755
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

150
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,125
When do we eat?

151
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:58,396
You eat when we say you eat.

152
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:01,729
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

153
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:04,642
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

154
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:07,746
On your feet.

155
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:09,632
I believe in two things:

156
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:12,196
Discipline and the Bible.

157
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,651
Here, you'll receive both.

158
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,468
Put your trust in the Lord.

159
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:20,192
Your ass belongs to me.

160
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,778
Welcome to Shawshank.

161
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:30,048
Unhook them.

162
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:36,576
Turn around.

163
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:44,512
That's enough.

164
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:47,287
Move to the end of the cage.

165
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:50,679
Turn around. Delouse him.

166
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:53,947
Turn around.

167
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:59,258
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

168
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:00,733
Next man up!

169
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:04,318
To the right.

170
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:05,526
Right. Right.

171
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,257
Left.

172
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:11,292
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

173
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:14,711
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

174
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:18,555
...skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

175
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,501
And when they put you in that cell...

176
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,931
...and those bars slam home...

177
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:26,487
...that's when you know it's for real.

178
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:29,949
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

179
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,358
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

180
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:38,651
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

181
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:41,788
Somebody always breaks down crying.

182
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,862
Happens every time.

183
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,456
The only question is...

184
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,343
...who's it going to be?

185
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:52,507
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

186
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:56,085
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

187
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,323
Lights out!

188
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,245
I remember my first night.

189
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:31,863
Seems like a long time ago.

190
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:36,495
Hey, fish.

191
00:15:37,464 --> 00:15:39,220
Fish, fish.

192
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:42,419
What are you, scared of the dark?

193
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:47,249
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

194
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,742
Piggy! Pork!
I want me a pork chop.

195
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:01,840
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

196
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:04,981
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

197
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:07,852
Hey, Fat Ass.

198
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,578
Fat Ass!

199
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:13,359
Talk to me, boy.

200
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:16,627
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

201
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,668
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

202
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,682
This place ain't so bad.

203
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,278
Tell you what...

204
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,467
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

205
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,889
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

206
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,978
...love to make your acquaintance.

207
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:36,520
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

208
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:37,771
God!

209
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:39,761
I don't belong here!

210
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:42,672
- We have a winner!
- I want to go home!

211
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:45,484
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

212
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:49,836
Fresh fish!

213
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:57,453
I want to go home!

214
00:16:58,385 --> 00:16:59,563
I want my mother!

215
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:01,897
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

216
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:08,006
What the Christ is this horseshit?

217
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,215
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

218
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,718
You'll tell him
with my baton up your ass!

219
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:13,708
Let me out!

220
00:17:13,904 --> 00:17:17,166
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

221
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,229
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

222
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,734
Not me!

223
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:24,172
I won't count to three.
Not even to one.

224
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,342
You shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

225
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,416
Shut up, man. Shut up!

226
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,680
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

227
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:34,122
Open that cell.

228
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,450
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

229
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,566
Son of a bitch!

230
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:53,513
Captain, take it easy!

231
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:18,118
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

232
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:21,610
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

233
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,326
Every last motherfucker in here.

234
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:31,106
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

235
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:49,312
His first night in the joint, Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes.

236
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:52,381
He never made a sound.

237
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,347
Tier 3 north, clear count!

238
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:11,969
Tier 2 north, clear count.

239
00:19:12,454 --> 00:19:14,723
Tier 3 south, clear.

240
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:20,859
Prepare to roll out.

241
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:25,753
Roll out!

242
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:19,544
Are you going to eat that?

243
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,364
I hadn't planned on it.

244
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:24,569
Do you mind?

245
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,141
That's nice and ripe.

246
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:47,380
Jake says thank you.

247
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,903
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

248
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:55,514
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

249
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,331
Oh, no! Here he comes.

250
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,906
Morning, fellas.

251
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:04,986
Fine morning, isn't it?

252
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:07,446
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

253
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,846
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

254
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:12,562
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

255
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:14,773
Look at that.

256
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,325
- I can't stand this guy.
- Oh, Lord!

257
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:21,338
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

258
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,839
Smell my ass!

259
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:24,943
After he smells mine.

260
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,915
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

261
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:31,831
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

262
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:34,448
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

263
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:39,123
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

264
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:40,879
Hey, Tyrell.

265
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,118
You pull infirmary duty this week?

266
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:45,551
How's my horse doing anyway?

267
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:47,024
Dead.

268
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,938
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

269
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:52,241
Doc had gone home for the night.

270
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,899
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

271
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,463
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

272
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:04,754
What was his name?

273
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:09,201
What'd you say?

274
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,331
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

275
00:22:13,974 --> 00:22:16,624
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

276
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,590
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

277
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:43,657
Anybody come at you yet?

278
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:47,471
Anybody get to you yet?

279
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:51,496
Hey, we all need friends in here.

280
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:53,388
I could be a friend to you.

281
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:03,567
Hard to get.

282
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:07,015
I like that.

283
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:16,779
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

284
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,992
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

285
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:22,125
...trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

286
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:25,898
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

287
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:28,365
...to say more than two words
to somebody.

288
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,014
As it turned out...

289
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:33,260
...that somebody was me.

290
00:23:41,678 --> 00:23:43,369
I'm Andy Dufresne.

291
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:46,216
Wife-killing banker.

292
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:49,642
Why'd you do it?

293
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,036
I didn't, since you ask.

294
00:23:52,622 --> 00:23:54,378
You're going to fit right in.

295
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:57,158
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

296
00:23:57,773 --> 00:24:00,839
- What you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

297
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:06,211
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

298
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:09,860
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

299
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,466
What do you think?

300
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,755
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

301
00:24:15,852 --> 00:24:18,535
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

302
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,631
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

303
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:25,282
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

304
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:27,207
A rock hammer.

305
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:30,115
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

306
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:34,019
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

307
00:24:34,218 --> 00:24:36,552
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

308
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:39,399
Fair enough.

309
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:42,337
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

310
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:44,774
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

311
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,115
For rocks.

312
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:49,794
Quartz?

313
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:56,892
And some mica, shale...

314
00:24:58,088 --> 00:24:59,298
...limestone.

315
00:24:59,528 --> 00:25:00,607
So?

316
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:03,267
So I'm a rock hound.

317
00:25:03,688 --> 00:25:06,655
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

318
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:09,919
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

319
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,829
No, I have no enemies here.

320
00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:15,234
No? Wait a while.

321
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,333
Word gets around.

322
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:21,371
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

323
00:25:22,694 --> 00:25:24,417
Especially Bogs.

324
00:25:25,382 --> 00:25:28,677
Don't suppose it would help if l
told them I'm not homosexual.

325
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,244
Neither are they.

326
00:25:30,438 --> 00:25:33,754
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

327
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:42,307
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

328
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,883
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

329
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,735
- Thanks for the advice.
- Well, that's free.

330
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,947
You understand my concern.

331
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,627
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

332
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:58,393
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

333
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:00,861
What did I miss?
What's so funny?

334
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:03,836
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

335
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:07,741
What's an item like this usually go for?

336
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:10,326
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

337
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:13,184
My normal markup's 20 percent.

338
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:15,647
But this is a specialty item.

339
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:20,118
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

340
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:21,597
Ten it is.

341
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:25,207
Waste of money, if you ask me.

342
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:26,716
Why's that?

343
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:30,966
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

344
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:34,399
They find it, you're going to lose it.

345
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,599
If they catch you, you don't know me.

346
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,938
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

347
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:42,390
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

348
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:44,693
I understand.

349
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,862
Thank you, Mr...

350
00:26:48,062 --> 00:26:49,044
Red.

351
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,003
Name's Red.

352
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:53,943
Why do they call you that?

353
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,475
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

354
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,074
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

355
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:13,243
He had a quiet way about him...

356
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:17,557
...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

357
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:19,291
He strolled...

358
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:23,509
...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

359
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:28,180
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

360
00:27:30,043 --> 00:27:32,181
I think it'd be fair to say...

361
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,582
...I liked Andy from the start.

362
00:27:36,058 --> 00:27:39,702
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

363
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:45,295
Move it! Come on, move it!

364
00:27:47,802 --> 00:27:50,616
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

365
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,597
Andy was right.

366
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:30,961
I finally got the joke.

367
00:28:31,254 --> 00:28:33,556
It would take a man about 600 years...

368
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:36,116
...to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

369
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:42,067
- Book?
- Not today.

370
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,809
Book?

371
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,932
Delivery for Dufresne.

372
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:16,425
Here's your book.

373
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,411
Thanks.

374
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,978
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

375
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:09,251
This will blind you.

376
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:11,915
Honey, hush.

377
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,835
That's it. You fight!

378
00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:27,435
Better that way.

379
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:38,306
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

380
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:40,416
...and the Sisters let him be.

381
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,726
I wish I could tell you that...

382
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:45,769
...but prison is no fairy-tale world.

383
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:48,746
He never said who did it.

384
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,497
But we all knew.

385
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,534
Things went on like that for a while.

386
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,317
Prison life consists of routine...

387
00:31:00,585 --> 00:31:02,472
...and then more routine.

388
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:08,255
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

389
00:31:09,672 --> 00:31:11,428
The Sisters kept at him.

390
00:31:11,656 --> 00:31:13,631
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

391
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:15,261
Sometimes not.

392
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:18,464
And that's how it went for Andy.

393
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:20,706
That was his routine.

394
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:24,806
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

395
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:28,516
And I also believe that
if things had gone on that way...

396
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:31,173
...this place would have
got the best of him.

397
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,594
But then, in the spring of 1949...

398
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,612
...the powers that be decided:

399
00:31:36,806 --> 00:31:40,002
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

400
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:43,263
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

401
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:45,348
As you know...

402
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:49,468
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

403
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:51,970
It was outdoor detail...

404
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:56,447
...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

405
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:57,953
Stay in line there.

406
00:31:58,147 --> 00:32:01,181
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

407
00:32:05,283 --> 00:32:08,152
Wallace E. Unger.

408
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:10,912
Ellis Redding.

409
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:12,601
Wouldn't you know it?

410
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:16,190
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

411
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:18,295
Andrew Dufresne.

412
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,505
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

413
00:32:21,986 --> 00:32:24,353
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

414
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:27,862
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

415
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:29,559
I say, "Yeah?"

416
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:33,305
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

417
00:32:33,505 --> 00:32:37,247
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

418
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:39,546
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

419
00:32:39,744 --> 00:32:41,948
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

420
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:46,105
"He died a rich man." Oil wells
and shit. Close to a million bucks.

421
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:48,540
A million bucks?

422
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:53,141
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
- You going to see any of that?

423
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:56,377
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

424
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:57,720
Dollars?

425
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,300
That's great! That's like
winning the sweepstakes.

426
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,678
Isn't it?

427
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:05,725
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

428
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:08,187
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

429
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:10,203
Poor Byron.

430
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,103
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

431
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:16,472
Some people really got it awful.

432
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:18,042
Andy, are you nuts?

433
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:20,059
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

434
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:23,100
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up--

435
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,976
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

436
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:28,244
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

437
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:32,054
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

438
00:33:32,284 --> 00:33:35,796
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

439
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:38,035
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

440
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:42,097
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

441
00:33:44,635 --> 00:33:46,707
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

442
00:33:46,938 --> 00:33:49,360
Some brother.
Shit!

443
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:55,447
Mr. Hadley...

444
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:57,591
...do you trust your wife?

445
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:00,568
Oh, that's funny.

446
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,569
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

447
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,997
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

448
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:11,317
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

449
00:34:11,544 --> 00:34:12,526
He'll push him off!

450
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,516
If you trust her, you can keep...

451
00:34:14,744 --> 00:34:16,086
...that 35,000.

452
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:19,181
- What did you say?
- Thirty-five thousand.

453
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:20,974
All of it.

454
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:24,110
- Every penny.
- You better start making sense.

455
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:26,547
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

456
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:30,485
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

457
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:32,947
- Bullshit. Tax-free?
- Tax-free.

458
00:34:33,143 --> 00:34:35,030
IRS can't touch one cent.

459
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:37,781
You're that smart banker
that killed his wife.

460
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:41,235
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

461
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,147
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

462
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:48,236
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

463
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:51,950
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

464
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:55,410
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

465
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:57,099
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

466
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,471
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

467
00:34:59,924 --> 00:35:03,240
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

468
00:35:03,444 --> 00:35:05,419
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

469
00:35:05,652 --> 00:35:07,310
...nearly free of charge.

470
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,663
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

471
00:35:12,595 --> 00:35:14,057
"Coworkers." That's rich!

472
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:17,289
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

473
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,807
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

474
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:22,183
...sir.

475
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,825
What are you jimmies staring at?

476
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:29,544
Let's go! Work!

477
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,528
And that's how it came to pass...

478
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,274
...that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

479
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:47,848
...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

480
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:51,048
...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

481
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:56,485
...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

482
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,818
...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

483
00:36:00,015 --> 00:36:02,349
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

484
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:07,782
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

485
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:13,156
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

486
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:16,813
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

487
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:19,723
We were the lords of all creation.

488
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:21,796
As for Andy...

489
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:24,549
...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

490
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,138
...a strange little smile on his face...

491
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:29,478
...watching us drink his beer.

492
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,569
Want a cold one?

493
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:42,026
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

494
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:48,769
You could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards.

495
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:53,095
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

496
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:54,817
Me?

497
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:57,701
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

498
00:36:58,122 --> 00:37:00,261
...if only for a short while.

499
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:03,840
King me.

500
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:08,161
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
- What?

501
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:10,019
Civilized. Strategic.

502
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:13,535
And a total fucking mystery.
I hate it.

503
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:15,492
Let me teach you someday.

504
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,927
Sure.

505
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:20,034
We could get a board together.

506
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:23,199
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

507
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,229
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

508
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:30,595
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

509
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:32,517
I think it'll take years.

510
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:35,132
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

511
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:37,222
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

512
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:39,170
Pebbles, mostly.

513
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:46,017
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

514
00:37:46,854 --> 00:37:48,348
Yeah, I guess.

515
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,428
Can I ask you something?

516
00:37:51,846 --> 00:37:53,220
Why'd you do it?

517
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,899
I'm innocent, Red.

518
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:58,043
Just like everybody else here.

519
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:03,706
What are you in for?

520
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:08,380
Murder. Same as you.

521
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,692
Innocent?

522
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,593
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

523
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:12,915
Where's the canary?

524
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,362
How did you know?

525
00:39:14,558 --> 00:39:16,762
- How did I know what?
- So you don't know.

526
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,071
Come.

527
00:39:20,478 --> 00:39:22,485
This is where the canary is.

528
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:28,250
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

529
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:32,955
That's quite a...

530
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:35,446
...surprise.

531
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,922
Wait, wait.

532
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:42,864
Here she comes.

533
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,881
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

534
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:48,694
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

535
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:50,714
Gilda, are you decent?

536
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:52,755
Me?

537
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:57,046
God, I love it.

538
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,879
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

539
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,428
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

540
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,665
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

541
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:13,526
Can you get her?

542
00:40:14,874 --> 00:40:18,102
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

543
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:21,492
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

544
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:25,911
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

545
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:27,732
But I'll get her.

546
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,204
Relax.

547
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:32,243
Thanks.

548
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,681
- Get out!
- I got to change reels!

549
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,819
I said fuck off!

550
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:03,026
Ain't you going to scream?

551
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:06,097
Let's get this over with.

552
00:41:10,997 --> 00:41:12,906
He broke my fucking nose!

553
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:23,021
Now...

554
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:25,548
...I'm going to open my fly...

555
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:28,461
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

556
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:32,042
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

557
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,282
He ought to have
something to show for it.

558
00:41:34,482 --> 00:41:36,271
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

559
00:41:36,467 --> 00:41:38,954
No, you don't understand.

560
00:41:39,282 --> 00:41:42,184
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

561
00:41:42,385 --> 00:41:45,701
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

562
00:41:45,906 --> 00:41:47,760
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

563
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:51,302
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

564
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:54,448
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

565
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:55,950
...with a crowbar.

566
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,262
Where do you get this shit?

567
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:01,806
I read it.

568
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:05,704
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

569
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:08,359
Honey!

570
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:11,881
You shouldn't!

571
00:42:14,447 --> 00:42:17,229
Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.

572
00:42:17,487 --> 00:42:19,461
And neither did his friends.

573
00:42:19,886 --> 00:42:23,563
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

574
00:42:24,206 --> 00:42:26,595
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

575
00:42:27,374 --> 00:42:29,795
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

576
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,171
Time's up, Bogs.

577
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:40,421
It's your world, boss.

578
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:46,247
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

579
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:48,996
All prisoners report for lock down.

580
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:04,289
What?

581
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:18,847
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

582
00:43:24,425 --> 00:43:25,635
Help!

583
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,648
Two things never happened again
after that.

584
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:34,912
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

585
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,109
And Bogs would never walk again.

586
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:42,588
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

587
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:45,442
To my knowledge, he lived out
the rest of his days...

588
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,395
...drinking his food through a straw.

589
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:52,287
Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.

590
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,452
Sounds good to us.

591
00:43:55,718 --> 00:43:58,107
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

592
00:43:58,822 --> 00:44:00,993
The man likes to play chess.

593
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:03,299
Let's get him some rocks.

594
00:44:34,595 --> 00:44:35,773
Guys!

595
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:37,529
I got one.

596
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:39,160
I got one. Look!

597
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:44,888
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

598
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,912
What are you, a fucking geologist?

599
00:44:47,106 --> 00:44:48,764
He's right. It ain't.

600
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:51,743
- What the hell is it then?
- It's a horse apple.

601
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:54,975
- Bullshit!
- No, horseshit.

602
00:44:55,169 --> 00:44:56,576
Petrified.

603
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:06,361
Damn!

604
00:45:06,656 --> 00:45:10,714
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

605
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:12,821
And by the weekend
he was due back...

606
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:16,569
...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

607
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:19,764
Also got a big shipment in that week.

608
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,110
Cigarettes...

609
00:45:21,311 --> 00:45:22,293
...chewing gum...

610
00:45:22,495 --> 00:45:23,902
...sipping whisky...

611
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,356
...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

612
00:45:27,551 --> 00:45:30,169
And of course, the most important item:

613
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:33,940
Rita Hayworth herself.

614
00:46:09,531 --> 00:46:11,702
Heads up.
They're tossing cells.

615
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:14,484
Heads up.
They're tossing cells!

616
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,455
119.

617
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:20,819
123.

618
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:31,637
On your feet.

619
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:35,597
Face the wall.

620
00:47:08,342 --> 00:47:10,164
Turn around and face the warden.

621
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,475
Pleased to see you reading this.

622
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:21,620
Any favorite passages?

623
00:47:22,452 --> 00:47:24,721
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

624
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:27,055
...when the master
of the house cometh."

625
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:30,221
Mark 13:35.

626
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,721
I've always liked that one.

627
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:35,212
But I prefer...

628
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,456
..."l am the light of the world.

629
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:41,070
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

630
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:43,787
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

631
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:45,993
I hear you're good with numbers.

632
00:47:46,194 --> 00:47:47,142
How nice.

633
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:50,193
Man should have a skill.

634
00:47:52,626 --> 00:47:53,608
Explain this.

635
00:47:54,737 --> 00:47:58,632
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

636
00:47:59,057 --> 00:48:00,879
A little hobby of mine.

637
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:12,686
It's pretty clean.

638
00:48:12,944 --> 00:48:15,911
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

639
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,989
I can't say I approve of this.

640
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,974
But I suppose...

641
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:28,869
...exceptions can be made.

642
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,107
Lock them up!

643
00:48:42,893 --> 00:48:44,387
I almost forgot.

644
00:48:44,813 --> 00:48:46,885
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

645
00:48:47,597 --> 00:48:49,452
Salvation lies within.

646
00:48:49,645 --> 00:48:50,660
Yes, sir.

647
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,315
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

648
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:02,949
Truth is...

649
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:05,514
...Norton wanted to size Andy up.

650
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:20,871
My wife made that in church group.

651
00:49:23,434 --> 00:49:24,678
Very nice, sir.

652
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:27,592
You enjoy working the laundry?

653
00:49:29,194 --> 00:49:30,819
No, sir. Not especially.

654
00:49:31,145 --> 00:49:33,479
Perhaps we can find something more...

655
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,071
...befitting a man of your education.

656
00:49:43,816 --> 00:49:45,245
Hey, Jake.
Where's Brooks?

657
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:49,667
I thought I heard you out here.

658
00:49:50,312 --> 00:49:51,806
I've been reassigned to you.

659
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,308
I know, they told me.

660
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:57,086
Ain't that a kick in the head?

661
00:49:57,287 --> 00:49:59,491
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

662
00:49:59,687 --> 00:50:00,799
Come on.

663
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,808
Well, here she is.

664
00:50:04,007 --> 00:50:05,916
The Shawshank Prison Library.

665
00:50:06,566 --> 00:50:08,476
National Geographics...

666
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:12,033
... Reader's Digest condensed books...

667
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:13,757
...and Louis L'Amour.

668
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:16,066
Look magazine.

669
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,626
Erle Stanley Gardners.

670
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:22,201
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

671
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:24,957
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

672
00:50:25,444 --> 00:50:28,062
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

673
00:50:28,772 --> 00:50:31,554
- Any questions?
- How long have you been librarian?

674
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:36,570
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

675
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,900
And have you ever had an assistant?

676
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:42,465
No. Not much to it, really.

677
00:50:43,203 --> 00:50:44,381
Why me? Why now?

678
00:50:44,803 --> 00:50:46,047
I don't know.

679
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,145
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

680
00:50:59,938 --> 00:51:02,142
That's him.
That's the one.

681
00:51:09,473 --> 00:51:10,585
I'm Dekins.

682
00:51:10,977 --> 00:51:12,537
I was thinking...

683
00:51:13,184 --> 00:51:16,893
...about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

684
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,047
I see.

685
00:51:26,943 --> 00:51:29,790
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

686
00:51:32,863 --> 00:51:35,710
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

687
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,833
Thanks.

688
00:51:48,478 --> 00:51:49,492
So...

689
00:51:51,197 --> 00:51:52,855
Mister Dekins...

690
00:51:53,661 --> 00:51:55,668
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

691
00:51:55,869 --> 00:51:58,739
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

692
00:51:58,941 --> 00:51:59,955
He didn't say that!

693
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,673
As God as my witness!

694
00:52:02,941 --> 00:52:04,599
Dekins blinked for a second...

695
00:52:04,796 --> 00:52:07,796
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

696
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,391
- My ass!
- Shook his hand.

697
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,402
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

698
00:52:13,596 --> 00:52:17,687
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

699
00:52:17,883 --> 00:52:20,371
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

700
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:22,131
Making a few friends?

701
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:24,979
I wouldn't say "friends."

702
00:52:25,178 --> 00:52:28,855
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

703
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,287
It's a wonderful pet to have.

704
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,205
Got you out of the laundry, though.

705
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:35,543
It might do more than that.

706
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,355
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

707
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:41,041
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

708
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:45,550
How do you expect to do that?
I mean...

709
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:48,600
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

710
00:52:49,048 --> 00:52:51,023
I'll ask the warden for funds.

711
00:52:51,864 --> 00:52:55,955
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

712
00:52:56,184 --> 00:52:58,388
...one immutable, universal truth:

713
00:52:58,616 --> 00:52:59,958
Not one born whose asshole...

714
00:53:00,151 --> 00:53:04,886
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

715
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:08,501
- The budget's stretched thin as it is.
- I see.

716
00:53:08,695 --> 00:53:11,990
Maybe I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

717
00:53:12,182 --> 00:53:16,110
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

718
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,644
More walls, more bars, more guards.

719
00:53:18,837 --> 00:53:21,390
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

720
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:24,208
- They can't ignore me forever.
- Sure can.

721
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:27,022
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

722
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:29,804
I'll even mail them for you.
How's that?

723
00:53:31,412 --> 00:53:34,095
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

724
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:35,819
...just like he said.

725
00:53:39,828 --> 00:53:42,348
And like Norton said...

726
00:53:42,548 --> 00:53:43,955
...Andy got no answers.

727
00:53:51,827 --> 00:53:56,528
The following April, he did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

728
00:53:57,811 --> 00:53:59,982
Year after that, he did them all...

729
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,064
...including the warden's.

730
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:07,046
Year after that, they
rescheduled the intramural season...

731
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,584
...to coincide with tax season.

732
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:15,366
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

733
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:16,845
So Moresby Prison...

734
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:19,212
...issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

735
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,066
Right. The holster too.

736
00:54:21,265 --> 00:54:23,631
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

737
00:54:23,824 --> 00:54:26,726
Yes, sir!
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

738
00:54:27,408 --> 00:54:31,717
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

739
00:54:31,983 --> 00:54:34,350
Could you hand me
a stack of 1040s?

740
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:39,180
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

741
00:54:40,367 --> 00:54:43,400
And still, he kept
sending those letters.

742
00:54:49,902 --> 00:54:50,884
It's Brooks.

743
00:54:51,982 --> 00:54:53,411
Watch the door.

744
00:54:53,646 --> 00:54:54,922
Please, Brooks.

745
00:54:55,181 --> 00:54:56,904
- Calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

746
00:54:57,325 --> 00:54:59,846
- Stay back, goddamn it!
- What's going on?

747
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:02,500
One second he's fine,
then out come the knives.

748
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,424
We can talk about this, right?

749
00:55:04,684 --> 00:55:08,262
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

750
00:55:08,524 --> 00:55:10,182
What's he done to you?

751
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,973
It's what they done!

752
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,670
I got no choice.

753
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:16,327
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

754
00:55:16,524 --> 00:55:18,890
- Right, Heywood?
- Sure.

755
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:22,312
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

756
00:55:22,571 --> 00:55:23,618
Right, guys?

757
00:55:24,523 --> 00:55:26,945
So put the knife down.
Look at me.

758
00:55:27,179 --> 00:55:29,317
Put the knife down.

759
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:33,186
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

760
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:36,134
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

761
00:55:37,002 --> 00:55:38,409
It's the only way...

762
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:40,576
...they'd let me stay.

763
00:55:40,842 --> 00:55:43,111
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

764
00:55:43,337 --> 00:55:45,312
Put it, put it down.

765
00:55:53,736 --> 00:55:55,165
Take it easy.

766
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:57,310
You'll be all right.

767
00:55:58,312 --> 00:55:59,839
Him? What about me?

768
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,342
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

769
00:56:02,536 --> 00:56:04,358
You've had worse from shaving.

770
00:56:04,551 --> 00:56:06,558
What did you do to set him off?

771
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,898
Nothing.
I come in here to say farewell.

772
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:12,032
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

773
00:56:14,279 --> 00:56:16,962
I just don't understand
what happened in there.

774
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:19,842
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

775
00:56:20,038 --> 00:56:21,860
That's enough out of you.

776
00:56:22,054 --> 00:56:24,672
- Heard he had you shitting your pants.
- Fuck you.

777
00:56:24,934 --> 00:56:26,079
Knock it off.

778
00:56:27,014 --> 00:56:28,388
Brooks ain't no bug.

779
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,760
He's just institutionalized.

780
00:56:35,077 --> 00:56:36,931
"Institutionalized," my ass.

781
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:40,954
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

782
00:56:41,157 --> 00:56:42,815
This is all he knows.

783
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:45,216
In here, he's an important man...

784
00:56:45,412 --> 00:56:46,459
...an educated man.

785
00:56:47,235 --> 00:56:49,090
Outside, he's nothing.

786
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:53,272
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

787
00:56:53,475 --> 00:56:56,345
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

788
00:56:56,611 --> 00:56:58,269
You know what I'm trying to say?

789
00:56:58,531 --> 00:57:01,313
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

790
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:04,669
You believe whatever you want.

791
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,552
But I tell you these walls are funny.

792
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,683
First you hate them.

793
00:57:12,449 --> 00:57:14,271
Then you get used to them.

794
00:57:16,129 --> 00:57:18,038
Enough time passes...

795
00:57:18,689 --> 00:57:20,599
...you get so you depend on them.

796
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:23,674
That's "institutionalized."

797
00:57:23,872 --> 00:57:25,116
Shit.

798
00:57:25,313 --> 00:57:27,963
- I could never get like that.
- Oh, yeah?

799
00:57:28,801 --> 00:57:31,189
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

800
00:57:31,424 --> 00:57:32,918
Goddamn right.

801
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:37,246
They send you here for life...

802
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:40,124
...that's exactly what they take.

803
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,701
Part that counts, anyway.

804
00:57:51,006 --> 00:57:53,821
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

805
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:56,535
You go on now.

806
00:57:57,726 --> 00:57:59,154
You're free.

807
00:58:00,382 --> 00:58:01,876
You're free.

808
00:58:20,124 --> 00:58:21,717
Good luck, Brooksie.

809
00:58:58,136 --> 00:58:59,565
Dear fellas:

810
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:03,858
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

811
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:07,664
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

812
00:59:08,855 --> 00:59:12,204
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

813
00:59:12,824 --> 00:59:15,158
...but now they're everywhere.

814
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:22,803
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

815
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:41,585
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

816
00:59:41,877 --> 00:59:43,470
...called "The Brewer"...

817
00:59:43,668 --> 00:59:44,781
...and a job...

818
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,827
...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

819
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,635
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

820
00:59:51,828 --> 00:59:54,097
...but my hands hurt most of the time.

821
00:59:54,388 --> 00:59:56,275
Make sure your man double-bags.

822
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,410
Last time, the bottom near came out.

823
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,874
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

824
01:00:02,067 --> 01:00:03,376
Yes, sir. Surely will.

825
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:06,953
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

826
01:00:09,842 --> 01:00:13,966
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

827
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:15,815
I keep thinking...

828
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:19,246
...Jake might just show up
and say hello.

829
01:00:19,826 --> 01:00:21,735
But he never does.

830
01:00:22,898 --> 01:00:27,567
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

831
01:00:31,025 --> 01:00:33,643
I have trouble sleeping at night.

832
01:00:33,936 --> 01:00:37,067
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

833
01:00:37,328 --> 01:00:39,466
I wake up scared.

834
01:00:39,664 --> 01:00:43,722
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

835
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:49,869
Maybe I should get a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

836
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,315
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

837
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:59,747
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

838
01:00:59,982 --> 01:01:01,640
I don't like it here.

839
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,667
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

840
01:01:06,477 --> 01:01:08,070
...not to stay.

841
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,995
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

842
01:01:21,196 --> 01:01:24,545
...not for an old crook like me.

843
01:02:24,455 --> 01:02:28,546
"l doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

844
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:33,219
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

845
01:02:33,414 --> 01:02:35,650
No hard feelings. Brooks."

846
01:02:45,701 --> 01:02:47,588
He should have died in here.

847
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:54,242
What the fuck have you done?

848
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:56,989
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

849
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:05,885
- What's all this?
- You tell me. They're addressed to you.

850
01:03:07,107 --> 01:03:08,383
Take it.

851
01:03:16,578 --> 01:03:18,007
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

852
01:03:19,106 --> 01:03:20,993
In response to your inquiries...

853
01:03:21,186 --> 01:03:25,277
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

854
01:03:26,017 --> 01:03:27,773
This is $200.

855
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,799
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

856
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:34,456
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

857
01:03:34,657 --> 01:03:38,617
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

858
01:03:38,817 --> 01:03:40,540
Please stop sending us letters."

859
01:03:40,768 --> 01:03:43,321
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

860
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:44,664
Yes, sir.

861
01:03:48,768 --> 01:03:49,880
Good for you, Andy.

862
01:03:52,735 --> 01:03:53,815
Wow!

863
01:03:54,975 --> 01:03:56,830
It only took six years.

864
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,952
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

865
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:04,347
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

866
01:04:04,606 --> 01:04:05,402
...like he said.

867
01:04:05,598 --> 01:04:06,940
I've got to pinch a loaf.

868
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,540
When I come back...

869
01:04:08,734 --> 01:04:10,425
...this is all gone, all right?

870
01:04:57,178 --> 01:04:58,519
Do you hear that?

871
01:06:04,436 --> 01:06:05,549
Dufresne!

872
01:06:07,987 --> 01:06:09,449
Andy, let me out!

873
01:06:16,051 --> 01:06:20,786
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

874
01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:23,213
Truth is, I don't want to know.

875
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,799
Some things are best left unsaid.

876
01:06:29,234 --> 01:06:31,852
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

877
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,089
...it can't be expressed in words...

878
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,072
...and makes your heart ache
because of it.

879
01:06:38,673 --> 01:06:41,062
I tell you, those voices soared...

880
01:06:41,328 --> 01:06:45,452
...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

881
01:06:45,649 --> 01:06:48,877
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

882
01:06:49,072 --> 01:06:51,723
...and made those walls dissolve away.

883
01:06:52,144 --> 01:06:54,249
And for the briefest of moments...

884
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:57,317
...every last man at Shawshank
felt free.

885
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:02,344
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

886
01:07:03,598 --> 01:07:04,547
Open the door.

887
01:07:07,342 --> 01:07:09,033
Open it up!

888
01:07:10,286 --> 01:07:12,904
Dufresne, open this door!

889
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:15,335
Turn that off!

890
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:24,460
I am warning you. Turn that off!

891
01:07:41,484 --> 01:07:42,945
You're mine now.

892
01:07:50,091 --> 01:07:53,189
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

893
01:07:53,387 --> 01:07:54,913
On your feet.

894
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:58,343
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

895
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:03,554
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

896
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:06,565
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

897
01:08:06,761 --> 01:08:09,761
- Was it worth two weeks?
- Easiest time I ever did.

898
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:13,987
- No such thing as easy time in the hole.
- A week in the hole is like a year.

899
01:08:14,184 --> 01:08:17,348
- Damn straight.
- I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

900
01:08:17,545 --> 01:08:20,392
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

901
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:24,037
It was in here.

902
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:26,017
In here.

903
01:08:27,111 --> 01:08:29,118
That's the beauty of music. They...

904
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,556
...can't get that from you.

905
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:37,220
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

906
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:41,950
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

907
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:44,576
Lost interest in it, though.

908
01:08:44,774 --> 01:08:46,301
Didn't make much sense in here.

909
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:48,539
Here's where it makes the most sense.

910
01:08:49,062 --> 01:08:51,036
You need it so you don't forget.

911
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:52,735
Forget?

912
01:08:53,093 --> 01:08:56,060
Forget that there are...

913
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:57,636
...places...

914
01:08:58,117 --> 01:09:01,794
...in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

915
01:09:02,757 --> 01:09:04,185
There's something...

916
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:05,858
...inside...

917
01:09:06,116 --> 01:09:08,003
...that they can't get to...

918
01:09:08,196 --> 01:09:09,505
...that they can't touch.

919
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,394
That's yours.

920
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:14,395
What are you talking about?

921
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:16,573
Hope.

922
01:09:17,603 --> 01:09:18,880
Hope.

923
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:22,648
Let me tell you something, my friend.

924
01:09:23,427 --> 01:09:25,631
Hope is a dangerous thing.

925
01:09:26,755 --> 01:09:28,991
Hope can drive a man insane.

926
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,738
It's got no use on the inside.

927
01:09:31,938 --> 01:09:34,043
You'd better get used to that idea.

928
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:37,878
Like Brooks did?

929
01:10:02,207 --> 01:10:03,156
Sit down.

930
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:11,451
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

931
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,549
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

932
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:15,928
Oh, yes, sir.

933
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,426
Without a doubt.

934
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,852
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

935
01:10:23,773 --> 01:10:25,628
No danger to society here.

936
01:10:26,141 --> 01:10:27,602
God's honest truth.

937
01:10:30,077 --> 01:10:32,085
Absolutely rehabilitated.

938
01:10:41,675 --> 01:10:42,951
Thirty years.

939
01:10:44,844 --> 01:10:46,666
Jesus, when you say it like that...

940
01:10:47,499 --> 01:10:49,222
You wonder where it went.

941
01:10:51,563 --> 01:10:53,635
I wonder where 10 years went.

942
01:10:58,410 --> 01:10:59,392
Here.

943
01:10:59,818 --> 01:11:02,436
A little parole rejection present.

944
01:11:03,657 --> 01:11:05,283
Go ahead and open it.

945
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,287
Went through one of your competitors.

946
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:11,489
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

947
01:11:21,128 --> 01:11:22,556
It's very pretty.

948
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,345
Thank you.

949
01:11:27,815 --> 01:11:29,222
You going to play it?

950
01:11:33,607 --> 01:11:34,817
No.

951
01:11:38,279 --> 01:11:39,620
Not right now.

952
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:57,628
Roll in!

953
01:12:32,354 --> 01:12:33,532
Lights out!

954
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,758
Andy was as good as his word.

955
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,769
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

956
01:13:13,758 --> 01:13:17,686
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

957
01:13:17,918 --> 01:13:20,918
...they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

958
01:13:21,117 --> 01:13:25,241
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

959
01:13:25,437 --> 01:13:27,259
...just to shut him up.

960
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:30,322
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

961
01:13:30,525 --> 01:13:33,339
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

962
01:13:33,533 --> 01:13:36,184
He bought remaindered books
by the pound...

963
01:13:36,669 --> 01:13:38,130
Treasure Island.

964
01:13:38,652 --> 01:13:39,928
Robert Louis--

965
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,106
Stevenson.

966
01:13:41,308 --> 01:13:42,617
Fiction, adventure.

967
01:13:45,084 --> 01:13:46,066
What's next?

968
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:49,202
I got here Auto Repair...

969
01:13:49,915 --> 01:13:51,027
...and Soap Carving.

970
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:54,325
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

971
01:13:54,523 --> 01:13:56,311
Count of Monte Crisco.

972
01:13:56,763 --> 01:13:58,966
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

973
01:14:00,026 --> 01:14:00,974
By Alexandree...

974
01:14:01,434 --> 01:14:02,644
...Dum-ass.

975
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:03,952
Dumb ass.

976
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:07,185
Dumb ass?

977
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:11,864
Dumas. Know what that's about?

978
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:15,928
You'd like it.
It's about a prison break.

979
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:19,863
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

980
01:14:20,696 --> 01:14:24,624
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

981
01:14:25,176 --> 01:14:26,866
By the year Kennedy was shot...

982
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:31,405
...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

983
01:14:31,703 --> 01:14:34,670
...into the best prison library
in New England...

984
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:38,166
...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

985
01:14:45,238 --> 01:14:47,093
That was also when Warden Norton...

986
01:14:47,286 --> 01:14:50,101
...instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

987
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:52,524
You may remember reading about it.

988
01:14:52,758 --> 01:14:55,725
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

989
01:14:55,926 --> 01:14:57,169
It's no free ride...

990
01:14:57,365 --> 01:15:00,463
..but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

991
01:15:00,661 --> 01:15:03,050
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

992
01:15:03,381 --> 01:15:05,802
Our inmates, properly supervised...

993
01:15:06,004 --> 01:15:08,524
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

994
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:12,140
...performing all manner
of public service.

995
01:15:12,404 --> 01:15:14,543
These men can learn the value...

996
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:18,384
...of an honest day's labor and
provide a service to the community...

997
01:15:18,579 --> 01:15:23,085
...at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

998
01:15:23,507 --> 01:15:25,744
Of course he didn't tell the press...

999
01:15:25,939 --> 01:15:29,255
...that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1000
01:15:29,459 --> 01:15:32,360
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1001
01:15:32,563 --> 01:15:34,951
Men, materials, you name it.

1002
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:38,064
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1003
01:15:38,258 --> 01:15:40,679
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1004
01:15:40,882 --> 01:15:45,137
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1005
01:15:45,681 --> 01:15:48,528
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1006
01:15:48,721 --> 01:15:52,234
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1007
01:15:54,801 --> 01:15:56,262
We go back a long way.

1008
01:15:57,521 --> 01:16:02,255
I need this highway contract. I don't
get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1009
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,843
You have some of this fine pie...

1010
01:16:05,071 --> 01:16:08,268
...my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1011
01:16:16,207 --> 01:16:18,792
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1012
01:16:19,022 --> 01:16:21,957
I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1013
01:16:23,854 --> 01:16:26,788
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1014
01:16:27,853 --> 01:16:29,926
And behind every shady deal...

1015
01:16:30,254 --> 01:16:32,774
...behind every dollar earned...

1016
01:16:33,038 --> 01:16:35,972
...there was Andy, keeping the books.

1017
01:16:36,365 --> 01:16:37,575
Two deposits.

1018
01:16:37,804 --> 01:16:41,765
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1019
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:14,886
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1020
01:17:15,337 --> 01:17:18,719
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1021
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:20,197
How do I look?

1022
01:17:21,194 --> 01:17:23,582
- Very nice.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1023
01:17:23,785 --> 01:17:25,246
Governor will be there.

1024
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,007
You want the rest of this?

1025
01:17:29,288 --> 01:17:31,143
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1026
01:17:32,328 --> 01:17:33,604
Thank you, sir.

1027
01:17:36,328 --> 01:17:39,426
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1028
01:17:39,624 --> 01:17:44,260
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1029
01:17:44,455 --> 01:17:46,724
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1030
01:17:46,919 --> 01:17:50,595
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1031
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,481
That's where I come in.

1032
01:17:53,063 --> 01:17:55,266
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1033
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:58,179
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1034
01:17:58,502 --> 01:18:01,884
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back...

1035
01:18:02,085 --> 01:18:04,933
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
- Cleaner.

1036
01:18:05,509 --> 01:18:08,956
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1037
01:18:11,205 --> 01:18:15,361
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1038
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:18,206
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1039
01:18:18,404 --> 01:18:21,306
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1040
01:18:21,508 --> 01:18:24,770
Now anybody gets curious,
FBI, IRS...

1041
01:18:24,963 --> 01:18:25,912
...whatever.

1042
01:18:26,339 --> 01:18:27,583
It'll lead to somebody.

1043
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:31,489
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1044
01:18:35,683 --> 01:18:36,631
All right, who?

1045
01:18:36,834 --> 01:18:38,361
Randall Stevens.

1046
01:18:38,883 --> 01:18:39,776
Who?

1047
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:41,879
The "silent" silent partner.

1048
01:18:42,082 --> 01:18:45,016
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1049
01:18:45,217 --> 01:18:47,290
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1050
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:50,239
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1051
01:18:50,818 --> 01:18:51,995
But who is he?

1052
01:18:52,193 --> 01:18:55,989
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1053
01:18:57,057 --> 01:18:58,169
I conjured him...

1054
01:18:58,369 --> 01:18:59,678
...out of thin air.

1055
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:03,067
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1056
01:19:06,016 --> 01:19:08,285
You can't just make a person up.

1057
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,447
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1058
01:19:11,936 --> 01:19:14,653
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1059
01:19:14,975 --> 01:19:17,495
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1060
01:19:17,695 --> 01:19:19,735
...driver's license, Social Security.

1061
01:19:19,999 --> 01:19:20,947
You're shitting me.

1062
01:19:21,151 --> 01:19:24,379
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1063
01:19:24,574 --> 01:19:26,232
...a figment of my imagination.

1064
01:19:26,431 --> 01:19:28,340
Well, I'll be damned!

1065
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:31,288
Did I say you were good?

1066
01:19:31,645 --> 01:19:33,206
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1067
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:35,575
The funny thing is...

1068
01:19:35,774 --> 01:19:39,702
...on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1069
01:19:40,093 --> 01:19:42,329
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1070
01:19:50,844 --> 01:19:52,088
Ever bother you?

1071
01:19:53,468 --> 01:19:56,402
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1072
01:19:56,668 --> 01:19:58,577
A fine line, maybe...

1073
01:19:59,131 --> 01:20:01,106
...but I also built that library...

1074
01:20:01,307 --> 01:20:04,209
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1075
01:20:04,411 --> 01:20:06,550
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1076
01:20:06,747 --> 01:20:08,852
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1077
01:20:09,051 --> 01:20:10,457
Money instead of sheets.

1078
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:13,298
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1079
01:20:29,848 --> 01:20:32,369
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1080
01:20:32,601 --> 01:20:34,739
...on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1081
01:20:34,968 --> 01:20:37,205
That's breaking and entering to you.

1082
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:41,523
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1083
01:20:41,944 --> 01:20:43,188
Young punk.

1084
01:20:43,383 --> 01:20:44,943
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1085
01:20:45,144 --> 01:20:46,605
...cocky as hell.

1086
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:49,109
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1087
01:20:49,335 --> 01:20:51,026
Making me look bad.

1088
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:52,946
We liked him immediately.

1089
01:20:53,175 --> 01:20:56,753
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1090
01:20:57,046 --> 01:21:00,527
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1091
01:21:01,142 --> 01:21:03,029
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1092
01:21:03,222 --> 01:21:07,499
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1093
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:11,345
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

1094
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:14,857
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1095
01:21:19,156 --> 01:21:21,360
You done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1096
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:25,641
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1097
01:21:25,908 --> 01:21:27,763
Weekend furloughs.
Work programs.

1098
01:21:27,956 --> 01:21:28,970
Not like here.

1099
01:21:29,172 --> 01:21:31,506
Sounds like you done time all over.

1100
01:21:31,924 --> 01:21:34,225
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1101
01:21:34,419 --> 01:21:36,524
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1102
01:21:36,723 --> 01:21:39,276
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1103
01:21:40,659 --> 01:21:42,153
What I mean is...

1104
01:21:42,483 --> 01:21:45,778
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1105
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:49,101
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1106
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:51,017
What are you in for?

1107
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:52,231
Me?

1108
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:56,170
A lawyer fucked me.

1109
01:21:59,922 --> 01:22:02,769
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1110
01:22:10,352 --> 01:22:14,574
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1111
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,160
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1112
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:19,748
...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1113
01:22:20,047 --> 01:22:21,356
Whatever it was...

1114
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,013
...something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.

1115
01:22:27,695 --> 01:22:30,444
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1116
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,060
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1117
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,489
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1118
01:22:37,838 --> 01:22:40,227
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1119
01:22:41,902 --> 01:22:43,658
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1120
01:22:45,261 --> 01:22:46,635
You really mean that?

1121
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,938
Yes, sir, I do.

1122
01:22:49,132 --> 01:22:51,020
Good. Because if we do this...

1123
01:22:51,212 --> 01:22:55,009
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1124
01:22:55,245 --> 01:22:56,968
Thing is, see...

1125
01:22:58,188 --> 01:22:59,649
...I don't read so good.

1126
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:01,827
"Well."

1127
01:23:03,756 --> 01:23:05,414
You don't read...

1128
01:23:05,644 --> 01:23:07,105
...so well.

1129
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:10,784
We'll get to that.

1130
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:17,090
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1131
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:19,810
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1132
01:23:21,866 --> 01:23:23,971
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1133
01:23:24,234 --> 01:23:26,885
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1134
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:32,425
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1135
01:23:32,617 --> 01:23:34,210
He really liked the kid.

1136
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:37,824
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1137
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,484
But that wasn't the only reason.

1138
01:23:41,161 --> 01:23:43,266
Prison time is slow time.

1139
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,208
So you do what you can to keep going.

1140
01:23:46,536 --> 01:23:48,510
Some fellas collect stamps.

1141
01:23:48,903 --> 01:23:51,270
Others build matchstick houses.

1142
01:23:51,847 --> 01:23:54,400
Andy built a library.

1143
01:23:54,887 --> 01:23:56,742
Now he needed a new project.

1144
01:23:57,575 --> 01:23:59,004
Tommy was it.

1145
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:03,452
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1146
01:24:03,974 --> 01:24:07,073
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1147
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:09,153
In prison...

1148
01:24:09,414 --> 01:24:12,991
...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1149
01:24:13,734 --> 01:24:18,403
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1150
01:24:18,629 --> 01:24:20,734
...it was lovely Raquel.

1151
01:24:36,612 --> 01:24:37,560
Time.

1152
01:24:43,363 --> 01:24:44,311
Well?

1153
01:24:45,859 --> 01:24:47,898
Well, it's for shit.

1154
01:24:48,387 --> 01:24:51,103
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1155
01:24:51,298 --> 01:24:52,727
It's probably not that bad.

1156
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:56,988
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1157
01:24:57,186 --> 01:24:58,844
Let's see how the score comes out.

1158
01:24:59,042 --> 01:25:01,889
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1159
01:25:03,745 --> 01:25:05,054
Two points, right there!

1160
01:25:05,249 --> 01:25:06,743
There's your goddamn score!

1161
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:10,522
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1162
01:25:11,425 --> 01:25:12,985
Fuck this place!

1163
01:25:13,217 --> 01:25:14,297
Fuck it!

1164
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:33,881
I feel bad.

1165
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:35,224
I let him down.

1166
01:25:35,423 --> 01:25:37,081
That's crap, kid.

1167
01:25:37,278 --> 01:25:38,554
He's proud of you.

1168
01:25:38,879 --> 01:25:41,628
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1169
01:25:41,822 --> 01:25:43,316
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1170
01:25:43,518 --> 01:25:46,518
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1171
01:25:46,717 --> 01:25:48,856
What's he in here for anyway?

1172
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:50,109
Murder.

1173
01:25:51,517 --> 01:25:52,826
The hell, you say.

1174
01:25:54,877 --> 01:25:57,113
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1175
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:02,228
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1176
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:10,864
What?

1177
01:26:12,155 --> 01:26:14,610
About four years ago...

1178
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:17,973
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1179
01:26:18,459 --> 01:26:19,702
I stole a car.

1180
01:26:20,059 --> 01:26:21,968
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1181
01:26:22,619 --> 01:26:24,757
About six months left to go...

1182
01:26:25,051 --> 01:26:26,873
...I get a new cellmate in.

1183
01:26:27,546 --> 01:26:29,106
Elmo Blatch.

1184
01:26:29,786 --> 01:26:31,062
Big, twitchy fucker.

1185
01:26:31,897 --> 01:26:35,246
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1186
01:26:35,449 --> 01:26:38,067
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1187
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:40,500
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1188
01:26:40,697 --> 01:26:45,431
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1189
01:26:46,456 --> 01:26:50,896
Talked all the time too. That's
the other thing. He never shut up.

1190
01:26:51,096 --> 01:26:52,656
Places he'd been in...

1191
01:26:52,951 --> 01:26:55,886
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1192
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,225
Even people he killed.

1193
01:26:59,416 --> 01:27:02,099
People who "gave him shit."

1194
01:27:02,711 --> 01:27:04,205
That's how he put it.

1195
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:08,685
So one night, like a joke...

1196
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:13,099
...I say to him,
"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1197
01:27:13,334 --> 01:27:14,381
So he says:

1198
01:27:14,582 --> 01:27:18,378
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1199
01:27:19,029 --> 01:27:22,771
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1200
01:27:24,789 --> 01:27:26,698
So I pick out this guy...

1201
01:27:27,573 --> 01:27:29,067
...go in one night...

1202
01:27:29,269 --> 01:27:30,927
...and do his place.

1203
01:27:32,308 --> 01:27:33,584
He wakes up...

1204
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:35,983
...and gives me shit.

1205
01:27:37,012 --> 01:27:38,605
So I killed him.

1206
01:27:40,308 --> 01:27:43,024
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1207
01:27:44,372 --> 01:27:46,543
And that's the best part.

1208
01:27:47,187 --> 01:27:49,554
She's fucking this prick, see...

1209
01:27:49,747 --> 01:27:52,681
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1210
01:27:53,267 --> 01:27:55,722
Some hotshot banker.

1211
01:27:57,107 --> 01:27:59,495
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1212
01:28:10,513 --> 01:28:14,222
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1213
01:28:15,441 --> 01:28:17,830
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1214
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:19,472
Sir?

1215
01:28:21,617 --> 01:28:25,064
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1216
01:28:25,648 --> 01:28:29,423
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1217
01:28:29,615 --> 01:28:31,688
He's young, not terribly bright.

1218
01:28:32,207 --> 01:28:35,502
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1219
01:28:35,887 --> 01:28:37,381
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1220
01:28:38,127 --> 01:28:42,120
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1221
01:28:42,382 --> 01:28:46,822
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1222
01:28:47,022 --> 01:28:49,608
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1223
01:28:49,806 --> 01:28:52,489
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1224
01:28:52,686 --> 01:28:55,053
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1225
01:28:55,277 --> 01:28:57,132
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1226
01:28:57,325 --> 01:28:59,692
They'd have his last known address.

1227
01:28:59,885 --> 01:29:01,740
It's a chance, isn't it?

1228
01:29:03,981 --> 01:29:05,639
How can you be so obtuse?

1229
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:07,489
What?

1230
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:10,347
What did you call me?

1231
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,198
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1232
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:13,984
You're forgetting yourself.

1233
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:17,130
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1234
01:29:17,324 --> 01:29:19,974
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1235
01:29:20,172 --> 01:29:22,757
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1236
01:29:22,955 --> 01:29:25,442
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1237
01:29:25,643 --> 01:29:28,130
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1238
01:29:28,747 --> 01:29:31,594
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1239
01:29:33,386 --> 01:29:36,201
Don't ever mention money to me,
you son of a bitch!

1240
01:29:36,393 --> 01:29:37,986
Not in this office...

1241
01:29:38,186 --> 01:29:40,040
...not anywhere.
Get in here, now!

1242
01:29:40,266 --> 01:29:42,851
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1243
01:29:43,465 --> 01:29:44,675
Solitary. A month.

1244
01:29:45,641 --> 01:29:46,884
What's wrong with you?

1245
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:48,325
Get him out of here.

1246
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,014
This is my chance to get out!

1247
01:29:50,217 --> 01:29:51,940
It's my life! Understand?!

1248
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:54,111
Get him out!

1249
01:29:55,816 --> 01:29:57,703
A month in the hole.

1250
01:29:57,896 --> 01:30:00,482
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1251
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,924
It's all my fault.

1252
01:30:02,119 --> 01:30:03,646
Bullshit.

1253
01:30:04,295 --> 01:30:06,881
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1254
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:09,381
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1255
01:30:09,575 --> 01:30:11,517
I mean, for real innocent?

1256
01:30:11,719 --> 01:30:12,995
It looks that way.

1257
01:30:13,415 --> 01:30:15,237
Sweet Jesus.

1258
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:17,250
How long has he been here now?

1259
01:30:17,638 --> 01:30:20,769
1947. What is that?
Nineteen years.

1260
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:23,486
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1261
01:30:29,093 --> 01:30:30,205
What you got?

1262
01:30:30,821 --> 01:30:32,097
Board of Education.

1263
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:33,755
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1264
01:30:33,957 --> 01:30:37,753
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1265
01:30:37,957 --> 01:30:40,029
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1266
01:30:40,516 --> 01:30:43,233
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1267
01:30:44,036 --> 01:30:45,313
Floyd, come on.

1268
01:30:50,531 --> 01:30:52,833
Will you throw that away, please?

1269
01:30:58,211 --> 01:30:59,869
Well, shit.

1270
01:31:12,033 --> 01:31:14,716
The kid passed. C + average.

1271
01:31:14,913 --> 01:31:16,920
Thought you'd like to know.

1272
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,887
Warden wants to talk.

1273
01:31:47,071 --> 01:31:48,085
Out here?

1274
01:31:48,287 --> 01:31:50,425
That's what the man said.

1275
01:32:05,885 --> 01:32:06,833
Warden?

1276
01:32:16,444 --> 01:32:20,338
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1277
01:32:21,788 --> 01:32:23,959
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1278
01:32:41,658 --> 01:32:43,632
We got a situation here.

1279
01:32:44,474 --> 01:32:46,481
I think you can appreciate that.

1280
01:32:46,681 --> 01:32:47,859
Yes, sir.

1281
01:32:48,121 --> 01:32:49,462
I sure can.

1282
01:32:49,721 --> 01:32:53,583
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1283
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,455
It's got me up nights.
That's the truth.

1284
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,396
The right thing to do...

1285
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,578
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1286
01:33:07,544 --> 01:33:08,918
Do you understand?

1287
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,654
I need your help, son.

1288
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:16,111
If I'm going to move on this...

1289
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:19,472
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1290
01:33:20,183 --> 01:33:21,197
I have to know...

1291
01:33:21,399 --> 01:33:23,919
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1292
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:25,198
Yes, sir.

1293
01:33:25,398 --> 01:33:26,576
Absolutely.

1294
01:33:27,062 --> 01:33:29,931
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1295
01:33:30,134 --> 01:33:32,043
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1296
01:33:32,245 --> 01:33:34,798
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1297
01:33:34,998 --> 01:33:36,721
Just give me that chance.

1298
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:42,097
That's what I thought.

1299
01:34:27,248 --> 01:34:29,070
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1300
01:34:30,769 --> 01:34:31,751
Terrible thing.

1301
01:34:33,297 --> 01:34:34,703
A man that young...

1302
01:34:35,025 --> 01:34:37,512
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1303
01:34:38,032 --> 01:34:40,421
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1304
01:34:41,136 --> 01:34:42,565
Truly, it did.

1305
01:34:45,455 --> 01:34:47,789
We just have to put it behind us.

1306
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:50,568
Move on.

1307
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:53,539
I'm done.

1308
01:34:54,798 --> 01:34:56,359
Everything stops.

1309
01:34:58,254 --> 01:35:00,491
Get someone else to run your scams.

1310
01:35:01,710 --> 01:35:03,465
Nothing stops.

1311
01:35:04,749 --> 01:35:05,862
Nothing.

1312
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:12,100
Or you will do
the hardest time there is.

1313
01:35:12,493 --> 01:35:14,697
No more protection from the guards.

1314
01:35:14,925 --> 01:35:19,627
I'll pull you out of that 1-bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1315
01:35:20,972 --> 01:35:23,306
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1316
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:26,081
And the library?

1317
01:35:26,732 --> 01:35:27,680
Gone.

1318
01:35:28,268 --> 01:35:30,723
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1319
01:35:31,179 --> 01:35:33,732
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1320
01:35:33,932 --> 01:35:35,971
They'll see the flames for miles.

1321
01:35:36,171 --> 01:35:38,887
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1322
01:35:40,106 --> 01:35:42,975
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1323
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:48,358
Or am I being obtuse?

1324
01:35:59,657 --> 01:36:02,177
Give him another month
to think about it.

1325
01:36:47,013 --> 01:36:49,947
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1326
01:36:50,725 --> 01:36:52,481
Like a closed book.

1327
01:36:53,253 --> 01:36:55,195
Complained about it all the time.

1328
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,594
She was beautiful.

1329
01:36:59,908 --> 01:37:01,369
God, I loved her.

1330
01:37:04,931 --> 01:37:07,069
I didn't know how
to show it, that's all.

1331
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,292
I killed her, Red.

1332
01:37:13,091 --> 01:37:14,814
I didn't pull the trigger...

1333
01:37:16,194 --> 01:37:17,852
...but I drove her away.

1334
01:37:19,298 --> 01:37:21,883
That's why she died, because of me...

1335
01:37:22,082 --> 01:37:23,391
...the way I am.

1336
01:37:32,033 --> 01:37:33,789
That don't make you a murderer.

1337
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,715
Bad husband, maybe.

1338
01:37:42,209 --> 01:37:45,340
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1339
01:37:45,536 --> 01:37:46,812
No, I didn't.

1340
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,055
Somebody else did.

1341
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:52,247
And I wound up in here.

1342
01:37:54,623 --> 01:37:56,150
Bad luck, I guess.

1343
01:38:01,151 --> 01:38:02,525
It floats around.

1344
01:38:03,519 --> 01:38:05,657
It's got to land on somebody.

1345
01:38:06,526 --> 01:38:08,348
It was my turn, that's all.

1346
01:38:09,022 --> 01:38:11,673
I was in the path of the tornado.

1347
01:38:17,373 --> 01:38:21,169
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1348
01:38:25,341 --> 01:38:26,966
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1349
01:38:28,156 --> 01:38:29,138
Me?

1350
01:38:31,996 --> 01:38:32,944
Yeah.

1351
01:38:34,236 --> 01:38:36,440
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1352
01:38:36,635 --> 01:38:39,668
...and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs.

1353
01:38:41,627 --> 01:38:43,187
I tell you where I'd go.

1354
01:38:44,603 --> 01:38:46,196
Zihuatanejo.

1355
01:38:47,034 --> 01:38:48,179
Say what?

1356
01:38:48,474 --> 01:38:50,230
Zihuatanejo.

1357
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:52,723
It's in Mexico.

1358
01:38:54,042 --> 01:38:56,082
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1359
01:38:57,178 --> 01:38:59,861
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1360
01:39:01,593 --> 01:39:03,502
They say it has no memory.

1361
01:39:05,401 --> 01:39:07,954
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1362
01:39:09,528 --> 01:39:11,917
A warm place with no memory.

1363
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:16,886
Open up a little hotel...

1364
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,948
...right on the beach.

1365
01:39:20,535 --> 01:39:22,640
Buy some worthless old boat...

1366
01:39:23,159 --> 01:39:24,719
...and fix it up new.

1367
01:39:27,351 --> 01:39:28,528
Take my guests out...

1368
01:39:29,335 --> 01:39:30,644
...charter fishing.

1369
01:39:34,326 --> 01:39:35,984
Zihuatanejo.

1370
01:39:39,382 --> 01:39:43,091
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1371
01:39:49,365 --> 01:39:52,082
I don't think I could make it
on the outside.

1372
01:39:58,484 --> 01:40:00,459
I been in here most of my life.

1373
01:40:01,844 --> 01:40:03,535
I'm an institutional man now.

1374
01:40:04,404 --> 01:40:06,062
Just like Brooks was.

1375
01:40:07,475 --> 01:40:09,101
You underestimate yourself.

1376
01:40:09,651 --> 01:40:11,178
I don't think so.

1377
01:40:14,867 --> 01:40:18,642
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1378
01:40:19,379 --> 01:40:21,800
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1379
01:40:22,003 --> 01:40:24,141
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1380
01:40:26,194 --> 01:40:27,754
Pacific Ocean?

1381
01:40:28,146 --> 01:40:29,323
Shit.

1382
01:40:29,682 --> 01:40:31,787
Scare me to death,
something that big.

1383
01:40:31,985 --> 01:40:33,229
Not me.

1384
01:40:34,386 --> 01:40:37,036
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1385
01:40:38,705 --> 01:40:41,803
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1386
01:40:42,801 --> 01:40:44,229
That hotel, that boat...

1387
01:40:45,936 --> 01:40:48,075
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1388
01:40:52,783 --> 01:40:55,117
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1389
01:40:55,311 --> 01:40:57,253
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1390
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:00,046
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1391
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,733
...and that's the way it is.

1392
01:41:02,063 --> 01:41:04,780
Yeah, right.
That's the way it is.

1393
01:41:06,222 --> 01:41:08,524
It's down there and I'm in here.

1394
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:13,608
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1395
01:41:16,398 --> 01:41:17,827
Get busy living...

1396
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:21,092
...or get busy dying.

1397
01:41:32,716 --> 01:41:35,334
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1398
01:41:35,532 --> 01:41:37,703
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1399
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:43,209
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1400
01:41:44,619 --> 01:41:47,618
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1401
01:41:47,819 --> 01:41:51,593
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1402
01:41:51,787 --> 01:41:54,536
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1403
01:41:55,434 --> 01:41:57,823
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1404
01:41:59,178 --> 01:42:01,185
We went there for a picnic...

1405
01:42:01,578 --> 01:42:03,585
...and made love under that oak...

1406
01:42:04,233 --> 01:42:06,372
...and I asked and she said yes.

1407
01:42:10,217 --> 01:42:11,973
Promise me, Red.

1408
01:42:12,777 --> 01:42:14,337
If you ever get out...

1409
01:42:14,536 --> 01:42:15,965
...find that spot.

1410
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:21,733
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1411
01:42:22,824 --> 01:42:25,726
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1412
01:42:28,296 --> 01:42:30,848
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1413
01:42:31,592 --> 01:42:32,769
What, Andy?

1414
01:42:33,191 --> 01:42:34,849
What's buried under there?

1415
01:42:36,391 --> 01:42:38,180
You'll have to pry it up...

1416
01:42:38,374 --> 01:42:39,584
...to see.

1417
01:42:45,222 --> 01:42:47,109
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1418
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:49,408
He's talking funny.

1419
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:52,095
I'm really worried about him.

1420
01:42:52,485 --> 01:42:53,859
Let's keep an eye on him.

1421
01:42:54,053 --> 01:42:57,184
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1422
01:42:58,565 --> 01:42:59,645
Oh, Lord.

1423
01:43:00,933 --> 01:43:01,729
What?

1424
01:43:03,173 --> 01:43:05,823
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1425
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:08,027
He asked me for a length of rope.

1426
01:43:08,228 --> 01:43:09,024
Rope?

1427
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,813
Six feet long.

1428
01:43:11,044 --> 01:43:12,353
And you gave it to him.

1429
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:14,911
Sure. Why wouldn't l?

1430
01:43:15,107 --> 01:43:16,601
Jesus! Heywood.

1431
01:43:17,187 --> 01:43:19,074
How was I supposed to know?

1432
01:43:19,267 --> 01:43:20,761
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1433
01:43:22,691 --> 01:43:24,545
Andy would never do that.

1434
01:43:25,122 --> 01:43:26,137
Never.

1435
01:43:28,131 --> 01:43:29,407
I don't know.

1436
01:43:32,130 --> 01:43:34,071
Every man has his breaking point.

1437
01:43:36,321 --> 01:43:38,492
Lickety-split.
Want to get home.

1438
01:43:38,786 --> 01:43:40,476
Just about finished, sir.

1439
01:43:56,896 --> 01:43:58,456
Three deposits tonight.

1440
01:44:06,111 --> 01:44:07,933
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1441
01:44:08,127 --> 01:44:09,687
And shine my shoes.

1442
01:44:09,887 --> 01:44:12,701
- I want them looking like mirrors.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:44:17,982 --> 01:44:19,389
It's good having you back.

1444
01:44:20,286 --> 01:44:22,074
Place wasn't the same without you.

1445
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:08,048
Lights out!

1446
01:45:39,543 --> 01:45:41,964
I've had some long nights in stir.

1447
01:45:42,487 --> 01:45:45,039
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1448
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:47,792
...time can draw out like a blade.

1449
01:45:52,918 --> 01:45:55,787
That was the longest night of my life.

1450
01:46:10,996 --> 01:46:12,109
Give me a count!

1451
01:46:16,436 --> 01:46:19,152
Tier 3 south, clear!

1452
01:46:22,163 --> 01:46:25,197
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1453
01:46:25,395 --> 01:46:26,410
Dufresne!

1454
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:29,265
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1455
01:46:32,275 --> 01:46:35,536
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1456
01:46:42,801 --> 01:46:46,478
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1457
01:46:46,674 --> 01:46:49,837
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1458
01:46:50,033 --> 01:46:51,309
You hear me?

1459
01:46:57,168 --> 01:46:59,175
Oh, my Holy God.

1460
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:17,926
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1461
01:47:18,351 --> 01:47:20,806
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1462
01:47:23,278 --> 01:47:24,772
Open 237.

1463
01:47:28,142 --> 01:47:31,654
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1464
01:47:32,494 --> 01:47:33,770
Don't tell me that again.

1465
01:47:33,966 --> 01:47:34,947
But sir, he wasn't.

1466
01:47:35,181 --> 01:47:38,498
I can see that, Haig!
Think I'm blind?

1467
01:47:39,149 --> 01:47:40,490
Is that what you're saying?

1468
01:47:40,685 --> 01:47:43,238
- Am I blind, Haig?
- No, sir!

1469
01:47:44,108 --> 01:47:46,497
What about you. You blind?

1470
01:47:46,988 --> 01:47:49,443
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1471
01:47:49,644 --> 01:47:52,807
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1472
01:47:53,004 --> 01:47:54,280
"Dufresne."

1473
01:47:55,883 --> 01:47:57,290
He was in his cell...

1474
01:47:57,516 --> 01:47:58,443
...at lights out.

1475
01:47:58,635 --> 01:48:00,806
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1476
01:48:01,803 --> 01:48:03,363
I want him found.

1477
01:48:03,563 --> 01:48:06,879
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1478
01:48:07,115 --> 01:48:08,260
Yes, sir.

1479
01:48:09,226 --> 01:48:11,397
Let's go. Move your butts.

1480
01:48:14,666 --> 01:48:15,614
Stand.

1481
01:48:17,002 --> 01:48:18,016
Well?

1482
01:48:21,321 --> 01:48:22,269
Well, what?

1483
01:48:22,473 --> 01:48:25,790
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1484
01:48:26,824 --> 01:48:28,253
He must have said something.

1485
01:48:28,968 --> 01:48:30,430
No, sir, Warden.

1486
01:48:30,792 --> 01:48:31,720
Not a word.

1487
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:35,935
Lord, it's a miracle!

1488
01:48:36,519 --> 01:48:38,974
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1489
01:48:39,623 --> 01:48:40,736
Nothing left...

1490
01:48:41,543 --> 01:48:44,161
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1491
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:46,977
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1492
01:48:47,175 --> 01:48:48,866
Maybe she knows.

1493
01:48:49,095 --> 01:48:51,713
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1494
01:48:53,094 --> 01:48:54,338
Guess not.

1495
01:48:54,886 --> 01:48:56,991
Why should she be any different?

1496
01:48:58,022 --> 01:48:59,615
This is a conspiracy.

1497
01:49:00,230 --> 01:49:01,985
That's what this is.

1498
01:49:02,566 --> 01:49:06,143
One big, damn conspiracy!

1499
01:49:06,405 --> 01:49:08,315
And everyone's in on it!

1500
01:49:08,933 --> 01:49:10,045
Including her!

1501
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:45,276
In 1966...

1502
01:49:45,474 --> 01:49:47,776
...Andy Dufresne escaped...

1503
01:49:47,969 --> 01:49:49,463
...from Shawshank Prison.

1504
01:49:51,617 --> 01:49:54,072
All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1505
01:49:54,689 --> 01:49:56,150
...a bar of soap...

1506
01:49:56,353 --> 01:49:57,847
...and an old rock hammer...

1507
01:49:58,049 --> 01:50:00,416
...damn near worn down to the nub.

1508
01:50:04,736 --> 01:50:09,307
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it.

1509
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,440
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1510
01:50:29,982 --> 01:50:32,186
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1511
01:50:32,925 --> 01:50:35,959
I imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature.

1512
01:50:36,350 --> 01:50:38,106
An ice age here...

1513
01:50:38,526 --> 01:50:40,914
...million years
of mountain building there.

1514
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,602
Geology is the study
of pressure and time.

1515
01:50:45,404 --> 01:50:47,314
That's all it takes, really.

1516
01:50:48,028 --> 01:50:49,075
Pressure...

1517
01:50:49,693 --> 01:50:50,903
...and time.

1518
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:54,162
That and a big goddamn poster.

1519
01:50:58,043 --> 01:50:58,937
Like I said...

1520
01:50:59,419 --> 01:51:03,249
...in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1521
01:51:05,947 --> 01:51:10,551
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1522
01:51:11,066 --> 01:51:12,921
...a handful at a time.

1523
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:16,145
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1524
01:51:16,346 --> 01:51:19,193
...Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.

1525
01:51:19,386 --> 01:51:21,841
Lickety-split.
I want to get home.

1526
01:51:22,553 --> 01:51:24,495
I'm just about finished, sir.

1527
01:51:45,079 --> 01:51:46,934
Three deposits tonight.

1528
01:51:53,943 --> 01:51:56,147
Andy did like he was told.

1529
01:51:56,342 --> 01:51:59,691
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1530
01:52:03,222 --> 01:52:05,426
The guards simply didn't notice.

1531
01:52:05,718 --> 01:52:07,125
Neither did l.

1532
01:52:07,318 --> 01:52:08,779
I mean, seriously...

1533
01:52:08,981 --> 01:52:11,851
...how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1534
01:54:10,347 --> 01:54:13,380
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1535
01:54:13,611 --> 01:54:16,807
...of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1536
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:20,007
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1537
01:54:24,234 --> 01:54:26,503
Five hundred yards.

1538
01:54:26,986 --> 01:54:29,920
That's the length
of five football fields.

1539
01:54:30,537 --> 01:54:32,992
Just shy of half a mile.

1540
01:55:25,956 --> 01:55:30,364
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1541
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:33,377
...a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1542
01:55:33,604 --> 01:55:36,091
...strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1543
01:55:36,644 --> 01:55:39,677
Until that moment,
he didn't exist.

1544
01:55:40,227 --> 01:55:42,496
- Except on paper.
- May I help you?

1545
01:55:42,883 --> 01:55:44,737
He had all the proper ID...

1546
01:55:44,931 --> 01:55:48,476
...driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card...

1547
01:55:48,898 --> 01:55:51,320
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1548
01:55:51,522 --> 01:55:54,489
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1549
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:56,349
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1550
01:55:57,121 --> 01:55:58,169
Thank you.

1551
01:55:58,818 --> 01:55:59,930
I'm sure I will.

1552
01:56:00,802 --> 01:56:03,998
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1553
01:56:04,194 --> 01:56:05,142
Please.

1554
01:56:05,697 --> 01:56:08,086
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1555
01:56:08,577 --> 01:56:09,722
I'd be happy to.

1556
01:56:11,457 --> 01:56:12,733
Good day, sir.

1557
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:17,888
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1558
01:56:18,336 --> 01:56:19,863
All told, he blew town...

1559
01:56:20,064 --> 01:56:24,700
...with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1560
01:56:25,375 --> 01:56:28,026
Severance pay for 19 years.

1561
01:56:34,974 --> 01:56:37,079
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1562
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:30,584
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1563
01:57:30,841 --> 01:57:35,096
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1564
01:57:35,513 --> 01:57:39,790
I wasn't there to see, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1565
01:57:39,993 --> 01:57:41,422
...when they took him away.

1566
01:57:47,064 --> 01:57:50,326
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1567
01:58:05,527 --> 01:58:06,323
Samuel Norton.

1568
01:58:07,095 --> 01:58:09,429
We have a warrant
for your arrest. Open up.

1569
01:58:13,974 --> 01:58:15,022
Open the door.

1570
01:58:15,542 --> 01:58:16,753
I'm not sure which key.

1571
01:58:26,485 --> 01:58:28,340
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1572
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:42,696
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1573
01:58:42,899 --> 01:58:44,426
...other than that bullet...

1574
01:58:44,628 --> 01:58:48,882
...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1575
01:58:51,283 --> 01:58:54,599
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1576
01:58:54,866 --> 01:58:56,841
...I got a postcard in the mail.

1577
01:58:58,258 --> 01:59:00,975
It was blank,
but the postmark said...

1578
01:59:01,171 --> 01:59:03,210
...Fort Hancock, Texas.

1579
01:59:03,730 --> 01:59:05,039
Fort Hancock...

1580
01:59:05,298 --> 01:59:06,956
...right on the border.

1581
01:59:07,345 --> 01:59:09,255
That's where Andy crossed.

1582
01:59:09,810 --> 01:59:13,770
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1583
01:59:14,097 --> 01:59:16,236
...it always makes me laugh.

1584
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,494
Andy Dufresne...

1585
01:59:19,857 --> 01:59:21,799
...who crawled through
a river of shit...

1586
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,302
...and came out clean
on the other side.

1587
01:59:25,104 --> 01:59:26,413
Andy Dufresne...

1588
01:59:27,184 --> 01:59:28,711
...headed for the Pacific.

1589
01:59:31,568 --> 01:59:33,640
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1590
01:59:33,839 --> 01:59:37,483
He says, "l believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1591
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:40,428
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1592
01:59:41,071 --> 01:59:42,696
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1593
01:59:42,895 --> 01:59:45,742
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1594
01:59:46,062 --> 01:59:47,655
And he got it!

1595
01:59:48,846 --> 01:59:51,148
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1596
01:59:51,406 --> 01:59:52,780
...Andy being gone.

1597
01:59:53,454 --> 01:59:57,414
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1598
01:59:57,869 --> 01:59:59,843
Their feathers are just too bright.

1599
02:00:01,485 --> 02:00:03,143
And when they fly away...

1600
02:00:03,565 --> 02:00:07,787
...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1601
02:00:08,813 --> 02:00:10,023
But still...

1602
02:00:10,476 --> 02:00:14,632
...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1603
02:00:18,668 --> 02:00:20,937
I guess I just miss my friend.

1604
02:00:44,617 --> 02:00:45,511
Please sit down.

1605
02:00:51,112 --> 02:00:52,606
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1606
02:00:53,129 --> 02:00:56,260
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1607
02:00:57,032 --> 02:00:59,072
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1608
02:01:00,872 --> 02:01:02,366
Rehabilitated?

1609
02:01:04,328 --> 02:01:06,150
Well, now, let me see.

1610
02:01:07,111 --> 02:01:09,348
I don't have any idea
what that means.

1611
02:01:11,367 --> 02:01:13,538
It means you're ready
to rejoin society--

1612
02:01:14,087 --> 02:01:16,323
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1613
02:01:18,406 --> 02:01:20,315
To me it's just a made-up word.

1614
02:01:21,606 --> 02:01:23,842
A politician's word so that...

1615
02:01:24,262 --> 02:01:27,644
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1616
02:01:28,101 --> 02:01:29,628
...and have a job.

1617
02:01:31,526 --> 02:01:33,533
What do you really want to know?

1618
02:01:34,277 --> 02:01:36,164
Am I sorry for what I did?

1619
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:37,693
Well, are you?

1620
02:01:39,524 --> 02:01:42,241
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1621
02:01:43,556 --> 02:01:46,872
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1622
02:01:50,212 --> 02:01:52,667
I look back on the way I was then...

1623
02:01:54,723 --> 02:01:55,835
...a young...

1624
02:01:56,899 --> 02:02:00,247
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1625
02:02:03,139 --> 02:02:04,764
I want to talk to him.

1626
02:02:06,626 --> 02:02:08,993
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1627
02:02:09,698 --> 02:02:11,553
Tell him the way things are.

1628
02:02:13,569 --> 02:02:14,943
But I can't.

1629
02:02:17,057 --> 02:02:18,966
That kid's long gone...

1630
02:02:20,129 --> 02:02:22,779
...and this old man is all that's left.

1631
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:25,535
I got to live with that.

1632
02:02:26,848 --> 02:02:28,473
Rehabilitated?

1633
02:02:28,832 --> 02:02:30,588
It's just a bullshit word.

1634
02:02:31,488 --> 02:02:36,060
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1635
02:02:37,248 --> 02:02:39,419
Because to tell you the truth...

1636
02:02:39,743 --> 02:02:41,652
...I don't give a shit.

1637
02:04:04,632 --> 02:04:05,974
Here you go, miss.

1638
02:04:08,792 --> 02:04:09,774
Restroom break?

1639
02:04:15,351 --> 02:04:19,693
You don't need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1640
02:04:32,214 --> 02:04:35,148
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1641
02:04:35,957 --> 02:04:38,827
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1642
02:04:42,196 --> 02:04:44,269
There's a harsh truth to face.

1643
02:04:45,877 --> 02:04:48,659
No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.

1644
02:04:56,211 --> 02:04:59,757
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1645
02:05:00,532 --> 02:05:02,898
...so maybe they'd send me back.

1646
02:05:07,891 --> 02:05:10,225
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1647
02:05:11,091 --> 02:05:12,684
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1648
02:05:12,882 --> 02:05:14,737
Knew it all too well.

1649
02:05:16,274 --> 02:05:19,535
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1650
02:05:19,953 --> 02:05:22,571
Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.

1651
02:05:24,497 --> 02:05:26,766
Only one thing stops me.

1652
02:05:28,145 --> 02:05:30,446
A promise I made to Andy.

1653
02:05:50,127 --> 02:05:51,207
There it is.

1654
02:06:01,390 --> 02:06:02,983
Much obliged, sir.

1655
02:09:33,307 --> 02:09:34,518
Dear Red:

1656
02:09:34,748 --> 02:09:37,114
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1657
02:09:37,307 --> 02:09:41,201
...and if you've come this far,
maybe you'd come a bit further.

1658
02:09:41,467 --> 02:09:43,834
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1659
02:09:46,042 --> 02:09:47,471
Zihuatanejo.

1660
02:09:49,051 --> 02:09:52,498
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1661
02:09:52,986 --> 02:09:56,368
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1662
02:09:57,146 --> 02:09:58,488
Remember, Red...

1663
02:09:58,810 --> 02:10:00,817
...hope is a good thing...

1664
02:10:01,017 --> 02:10:02,927
...maybe the best of things.

1665
02:10:03,129 --> 02:10:05,201
And no good thing ever dies.

1666
02:10:05,721 --> 02:10:08,470
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1667
02:10:08,665 --> 02:10:10,323
...and finds you well.

1668
02:10:10,808 --> 02:10:11,986
Your friend...

1669
02:10:12,184 --> 02:10:13,297
...Andy.

1670
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:47,408
"Get busy living...

1671
02:10:47,606 --> 02:10:49,428
...or get busy dying. "

1672
02:10:52,021 --> 02:10:54,093
That's goddamn right.

1673
02:10:59,125 --> 02:11:01,164
For the second time in my life...

1674
02:11:01,396 --> 02:11:03,851
...I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1675
02:11:04,884 --> 02:11:06,739
Parole violation.

1676
02:11:07,379 --> 02:11:10,892
Of course I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1677
02:11:11,539 --> 02:11:13,481
Not for an old crook like me.

1678
02:11:13,683 --> 02:11:15,625
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1679
02:11:19,154 --> 02:11:23,693
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1680
02:11:24,114 --> 02:11:27,310
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1681
02:11:27,506 --> 02:11:29,895
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1682
02:11:30,098 --> 02:11:32,585
...whose conclusion is uncertain.

1683
02:11:35,473 --> 02:11:38,026
I hope I can make it across the border.

1684
02:11:39,473 --> 02:11:42,375
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1685
02:11:44,176 --> 02:11:48,071
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1686
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:50,985
I hope.
