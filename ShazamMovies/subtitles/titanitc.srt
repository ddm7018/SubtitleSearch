1
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:57,715
Thirteen meters. You should see it.

2
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,356
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:18,110
<i>Okay, Mir-2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.</i>

4
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:54,522
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

5
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:58,693
Seeing her coming out of the darkness
like a ghost ship...

6
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:00,695
still gets me every time.

7
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,499
To see the sad ruin of the great ship,
sitting here...

8
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,880
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning
of April 15, 1912...

9
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:13,215
after her long fall...

10
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:15,926
from the world above.

11
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,679
You're so full of shit, boss.

12
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:49,877
Dive six.

13
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,922
<i>Here we are again on the deck of Titanic.</i>

14
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:55,007
Two and a half miles down.

15
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:57,801
3,821 meters.

16
00:03:59,094 --> 00:04:02,932
The pressure outside
is three and a half tons per square inch.

17
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:05,768
These windows are nine inches thick
and if they go...

18
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:08,312
<i>it's sayonara in two microseconds.</i>

19
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:11,524
All right, enough of that bullshit.

20
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:28,707
Just put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters like yesterday.

21
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:29,834
Sure.

22
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:33,170
<i>Okay, Mir-2, we're landing
right over the Grand Staircase.</i>

23
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:35,172
<i>You guys set to launch?</i>

24
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:38,300
<i>Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.</i>

25
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,602
- All right, tether out.
- Tether out.

26
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:52,022
<i>Okay, Brock,
we're dropping down along the hull.</i>

27
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:59,029
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down,
and go into the first-class gangway door.

28
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:03,492
I want you guys working the D deck
reception area and the dining saloon.

29
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,494
<i>Copy that.</i>

30
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,501
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

31
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:14,712
Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left.

32
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:27,141
<i>Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.</i>

33
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,396
Okay, Lewis, drop down to B deck.

34
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,731
A deck.

35
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:36,567
- Give me some rope, Captain.
- B deck. Get in there.

36
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:18,984
- Watch the door frame. Watch it.
- I see it. I got it.

37
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:26,992
We're good. Just chill, boss.

38
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:42,633
Okay, make your turn.

39
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,928
- Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn. Watch the wall.

40
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,514
Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

41
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:50,266
<i>Copy that.</i>

42
00:06:58,274 --> 00:06:59,650
Right there.

43
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:03,195
- That's it. That's the bedroom door.
- I see it.

44
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,958
We're in. We're in, baby. We're there.

45
00:07:18,502 --> 00:07:22,047
That's Hockley's bed.
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

46
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,306
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

47
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,267
Hold it. Just a second.
Go back to the right.

48
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,942
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

49
00:07:42,735 --> 00:07:45,863
- You're smelling something, boss.
- I want to see what's under it.

50
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:47,865
Give me my hands, man.

51
00:07:53,078 --> 00:07:54,288
All right.

52
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:58,459
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

53
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:03,255
Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over.

54
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:05,049
Keep going. Go.

55
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:07,510
Okay, drop it.

56
00:08:16,435 --> 00:08:19,063
Oh, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?

57
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:24,276
It's payday, boys.

58
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:41,544
Cha-ching!

59
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:45,464
- We did it, Bobby.
- We brought it back.

60
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:47,049
Oh, yeah! You the man!

61
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:50,261
Who's the best, baby? Say it.

62
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:52,179
You are, Lewis.

63
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:56,934
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

64
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:06,485
Okay, crack her open.

65
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:10,239
Let me get around. Hang on.

66
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:11,615
- You getting it?
- Got it.

67
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,016
Shit.

68
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,478
No diamond.

69
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,106
You know, boss,
this same thing happened to Geraldo...

70
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,816
and his career never recovered.

71
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,198
Turn the camera off.

72
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:55,493
Brock. The partners would like to know
how it's going.

73
00:09:56,243 --> 00:09:59,497
Hey, Dave. Barry, hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe.

74
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,209
Don't worry about it.
There are still plenty of places it could be.

75
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,293
Hell, yes.

76
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:06,795
<i>The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room...</i>

77
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:09,423
- The purser's safe on C deck.
- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

78
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,716
A dozen other places.

79
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,178
Guys, look, you just got to trust
my instincts. I know we're close.

80
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,640
We just got to go through
a little process of elimination.

81
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:19,975
Hang on a second.

82
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:26,524
- Let me see that.
- We might have something here, guys.

83
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:32,029
- Where's the photograph of the necklace?
- We'll call you right back.

84
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,417
I'll be goddamned.

85
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:51,382
<i>Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known for finding Spanish gold.</i>

86
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,968
It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute.

87
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:57,888
<i>He has chartered Russian subs to reach

<i>- Hello, Brock.
- Hello, Tracy.</i>

92
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:09,817
<i>Of course, everyone knows

93

<i>You know, the nobility of the band
playing to the very end and all that.</i>

94
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,990
<i>But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories...</i>

95
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:18,742
<i>the secrets locked deep inside
the hull ofTitanic.</i>

96

<i>And we're out here using robot technology
to go further into the wreck...</i>

97
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,039
<i>than anybody has ever done before.</i>

98
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:26,417
<i>Your expedition is at the center
of a storm...</i>

99
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,461
<i>of controversy over salvage rights,
and even ethics.</i>

100
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:31,338
<i>Many are calling you a grave-robber.</i>

101

<i>Nobody ever called the recovery

- Turn that up, dear.

103

110
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:00,451
I'll be goddamned.

111
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,291
Brock, there's a satellite call for you.

112
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,128
Bobby, we're launching. See these
submersibles going in the water?

113
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:14,089
Trust me, buddy,
you want to take this call.

114
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:16,967
This better be good.

115
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:20,763
- You got to speak up. She's kind of old.
- Great.

116
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:25,726
<i>This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...</i>

117
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,645
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

118
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:29,396
Mrs. Calvert?

119
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:35,277
I was just wondering if you had found
the Heart of the Ocean yet, Mr. Lovett.

120
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:40,157
Told you you wanted to take the call.

121
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:44,328
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

122
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:47,706
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

123
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,501
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

124
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:11,188
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

125
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:15,693
God only knows why!
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

126
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,444
They're inbound!

127
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,620
<i>Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic
when she was 17, right?</i>

128
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:27,872
That's right.

129
00:13:27,913 --> 00:13:30,541
If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

130
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:32,877
101 next month.

131
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:35,838
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

132
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,632
Look, I've already done the background
on this woman...

133
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:42,553
all the way back to the '20s,
when she was working as an actress.

134
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,681
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

135
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:50,352
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

136
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:54,023
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

137
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:57,234
Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear,
Cedar Rapids is dead.

138
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:59,069
And everybody
who knows about the diamond...

139
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:02,072
is supposed to be dead or on this boat,
but she knows.

140
00:14:15,377 --> 00:14:18,088
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

141
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:20,007
Hurry up, give him a hand!

142
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:23,719
<i>Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.</i>

143
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:27,389
Okay, let's get her inside there.

144
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,434
- Hi, Miss Calvert.
- Hi.

145
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:33,354
<i>- Welcome to the Keldysh.
- Thanks.</i>

146
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:44,657
Yes?

147
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,077
- Are your staterooms all right?
- Oh, yes, very nice.

148
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:52,248
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?
She takes care of me.

149
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:56,585
We met just a few minutes ago.
Remember, Nana, up on deck?

150
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:57,795
<i>Oh, yeah...</i>

151
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:03,175
There. That's nice.
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

152
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:07,179
Can I get you anything?
Is there anything you'd like?

153
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:08,639
Yes.

154
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:11,433
I would like to see my drawing.

155
00:15:25,573 --> 00:15:29,869
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown.

156
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:32,454
It disappeared in 1792.

157
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,251
About the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

158
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:41,046
The theory goes that the crown diamond
was chopped, too.

159
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:45,676
Recut into a heart-like shape that became
known as the Heart of the Ocean.

160
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:48,888
Today, it would be worth
more than the Hope Diamond.

161
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:53,392
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.
I only wore it this once.

162
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,103
You actually think this is you, Nana?

163
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,813
It is me, dear.

164
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,191
Wasn't I a dish?

165
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,945
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

166
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:08,866
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

167
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:12,703
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

168
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:15,748
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

169
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:19,376
Nathan Hockley. That's right.
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

170
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:25,049
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son, Caledon, bought his fianc?e, you.

171
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:28,344
<i>A week before he sailed on Titanic.</i>

172
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:31,889
It was filed right after the sinking.

173
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,726
So the diamond had to have gone down
with the ship.

174
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,479
You see the date?

175
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,607
"April 14, 1912."

176
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:44,568
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is...

177
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:47,988
<i>she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.</i>

178
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,741
And that makes you my new best friend.

179
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:55,371
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

180
00:16:57,706 --> 00:16:59,083
This was mine.

181
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,294
How extraordinary!

182
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:06,924
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

183
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:14,890
The reflection has changed a bit.

184
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:34,201
<i>Are you ready to go back to Titanic?</i>

185
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:41,250
Here we go.
She hits the 'berg on the starboard side.

186
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,547
She kind of bumps along, punching holes
like Morse code along the side...

187
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,174
below the water line.

188
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:50,426
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

189
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:54,513
Now, as the water level rises,
it spills over the watertight bulkheads...

190
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:57,850
which, unfortunately,
don't go any higher than E deck.

191
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:02,188
So now, as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up, slow at first...

192
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:06,859
then faster and faster, until finally,
she's got her whole ass sticking in the air.

193
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:10,529
And that's a big ass.
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons.

194
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:13,574
Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure.

195
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:17,286
So what happens?
She splits, right down to the keel...

196
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:19,997
and the stern falls back level.

197
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:25,544
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern
vertical and then finally detaches.

198
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:31,008
Now the stern section kind of bobs there
like a cork for a couple of minutes...

199
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,802
floods, and finally goes under
about 2:20 a. M...

200
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:36,847
two hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

201
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:41,811
The bow section planes away,
landing about a half a mile away...

202
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:44,855
going 20, 30 knots
when it hits the ocean floor.

203
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:49,860
Pretty cool, huh?

204
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:53,864
Thank you for that fine forensic analysis,
Mr. Bodine.

205
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,868
Of course, the experience of it...

206
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,080
was somewhat different.

207
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:03,874
Will you share it with us?

208
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:00,598
- I'm taking her to rest.
- No.

209
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:02,683
- Come on, Nana.
- No!

210
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:09,857
Give me the tape recorder.

211
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:13,652
Tell us, Rose.

212
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:17,865
It's been 84 years.

213
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:21,911
It's okay. Just try to remember anything,
anything at all.

214
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:25,789
Do you want to hear this or not,
Mr. Lovett?

215
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:32,755
It's been 84 years...

216
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:37,134
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

217
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:41,597
The china had never been used.

218
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:45,309
The sheets had never been slept in.

219
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,065
<i>Titanic was called the ship of dreams.</i>

220
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:53,943
And it was.

221
00:20:54,985 --> 00:20:56,445
It really was.

222
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:30,771
All third-class passengers
with a forward berth...

223
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,732
<i>this way, please! This queue! Right here...</i>

224
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:36,944
- It's a big boat, huh?
- Daddy, it's a ship.

225
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:38,529
You're right.

226
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:10,686
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

227
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:13,397
<i>It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauretania.</i>

228
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:16,775
<i>You can be blas? about some things, Rose,
but not about Titanic.</i>

229
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:21,030
<i>It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania,
and far more luxurious.</i>

230
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:24,492
Your daughter is far too difficult
to impress, Ruth.

231
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:26,911
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.

232
00:22:26,994 --> 00:22:29,622
It is unsinkable.
God himself could not sink this ship.

233
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:32,583
Sir, you have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

234
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,709
It's round that way, sir.

235
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:36,212
I put my faith in you, good sir.
Now, kindly see my man.

236
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:39,173
<i>Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.
If I can do anything at all...</i>

237
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:40,549
Yes, right.

238
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:44,553
All the trunks from that car there.
Twelve from here.

239
00:22:45,346 --> 00:22:50,059
And the safe, to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

240
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:55,606
Ladies, we better hurry. Come along.

241
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:02,363
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

242
00:23:02,404 --> 00:23:04,907
Queue here for health inspection.

243
00:23:05,074 --> 00:23:08,786
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

244
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:10,704
Chin up.

245
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:18,546
<i>- Welcome aboard, ma'am.
- Welcome to Titanic.</i>

246
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,050
<i>It was the ship of dreams
to everyone else.</i>

247
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:26,011
<i>To me, it was a slave ship...</i>

248
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:29,390
<i>taking me back to America in chains.</i>

249
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:34,687
<i>Outwardly, I was everything
a well brought up girl should be.</i>

250
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,189
<i>Inside, I was screaming.</i>

251
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:57,126
<i>Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.</i>

252
00:23:58,127 --> 00:24:01,213
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

253
00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:09,346
Sven?

254
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:11,265
Bet.

255
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:31,702
All right.

256
00:24:31,785 --> 00:24:35,080
Moment of truth.
Somebody's life is about to change.

257
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,416
Brizio?

258
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:41,086
<i>- Niente.
- Niente.</i>

259
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:43,589
Olaf?

260
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:45,758
Nothing.

261
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:47,092
Sven?

262
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:52,890
Two pair.

263
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:55,059
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

264
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:57,144
<i>Che sorry, ma vaffanculo!
Did you bet all our money?</i>

265
00:24:57,228 --> 00:25:01,315
I'm sorry, you're not going to
see your mom again for a long time.

266
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:04,735
'Cause we're going to America.
Full house, boys.

267
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:19,917
Come on.

268
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:22,628
I'm going home!

269
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:28,008
- I'm going home.
- I go to America!

270
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:29,927
No, mate.

271
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:33,722
<i>Titanic go to America, in five minutes.</i>

272
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:37,143
Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here.

273
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:43,023
We're riding in high style now.
We're a couple of regular swells.

274
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:46,235
<i>We're practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio.</i>

275
00:25:46,318 --> 00:25:48,404
<i>You see? Is my destino.</i>

276
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:51,907
Like I told you,
I go to America to be millionaire.

277
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,080
<i>- You are pazzo.
- Maybe, but I've got the tickets.</i>

278
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:02,334
<i>- I thought you were fast.
- Aspetta!</i>

279
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:05,296
Wait! Hey, wait!

280
00:26:05,337 --> 00:26:07,464
We're passengers! Passengers!

281
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,468
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

282
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,595
Of course.

283
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:15,973
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
We're Americans, both of us.

284
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:17,975
Right. Come aboard.

285
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:25,024
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world. You know that?

286
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,451
Goodbye!

287
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,957
- You know somebody?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

288
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:44,460
- Goodbye. I'll miss you.
- Goodbye!

289
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:47,254
- Goodbye.
- I will never forget you!

290
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:36,846
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

291
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,477
G-60.

292
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,563
Excuse me, ma'am.

293
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:50,401
Right here.

294
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,904
How you doing? Jack. Nice to meet you.

295
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:57,199
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
How you doing?

296
00:27:58,075 --> 00:28:00,327
Who says you get top bunk?

297
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,419
This is your private promenade deck, sir.

298
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:11,380
Would you be requiring anything?
Excuse me.

299
00:28:12,298 --> 00:28:13,799
- This one?
- No.

300
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:16,135
It had a lot of faces on it.

301
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:18,846
This is the one.

302
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:22,308
Would you like all of them out, miss?

303
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:25,186
Yes, we need a little color in this room.

304
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:30,900
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

305
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,944
God, not those finger-paintings again.

306
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:35,863
They certainly were a waste of money.

307
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:39,325
The difference between Cal's taste
in art and mine is that I have some.

308
00:28:39,408 --> 00:28:41,243
They're fascinating...

309
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:43,787
like being inside a dream or something.

310
00:28:43,954 --> 00:28:45,498
There's truth, but no logic.

311
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:48,709
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

312
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:52,963
Something Picasso. He won't amount
to a thing. He won't, trust me.

313
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:55,925
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

314
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,552
Put it in the wardrobe.

315
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,770
<i>At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard
named Margaret Brown.</i>

316
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:10,022
<i>We all called her Molly.</i>

317
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,400
<i>History would call her
the Unsinkable Molly Brown.</i>

318
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:16,195
I wasn't about to wait all day for you,
sonny.

319
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:18,614
Here, if you think you can manage.

320
00:29:18,697 --> 00:29:21,826
<i>Her husband had struck gold,
someplace out west.</i>

321
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:24,954
<i>And she was what mother called
"new money."</i>

322
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:29,208
<i>By the next afternoon,
we were steaming west...</i>

323
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,293
<i>from the coast of Ireland...</i>

324
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:34,255
<i>with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.</i>

325
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:45,015
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.
Let's stretch her legs.

326
00:29:45,474 --> 00:29:46,684
Yes, sir.

327
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:51,730
- All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
- Very good, sir.

328
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,404
All ahead full.

329
00:29:58,737 --> 00:30:00,573
All ahead full!

330
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,950
Come on, lads, step lively.

331
00:30:09,623 --> 00:30:11,375
What's the reading?

332
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:24,555
All right! Let's stoke her right up!
We go full ahead!

333
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:26,557
Come on, right back to work.

334
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:23,239
21 knots, sir.

335
00:31:32,248 --> 00:31:33,833
Hey, look!

336
00:31:36,418 --> 00:31:37,711
See it?

337
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:43,551
There's another one. See him?

338
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,063
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

339
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:24,049
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

340
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:26,218
Very small, of course.

341
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:32,308
I'm the king of the world!

342
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:22,775
She's the largest moving object ever made
by the hand of man in all history.

343
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:28,447
And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews,
here, designed her from the keel plates up.

344
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:32,409
I may have knocked her together,
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

345
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,830
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale...

346
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:40,000
and so luxurious in its appointments that
its supremacy would never be challenged.

347
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,796
And here she is, willed into solid reality.

348
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:45,297
Hear, hear.

349
00:33:46,215 --> 00:33:47,967
The salmon.

350
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,264
You know I don't like that, Rose.

351
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:58,144
She knows.

352
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,650
We'll both have the lamb.
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

353
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,695
You like lamb, right, sweet pea?

354
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:08,821
Sausage.

355
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:12,741
You gonna cut her meat for her,
too, there, Cal?

356
00:34:14,827 --> 00:34:17,538
<i>Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?</i>

357
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:20,833
- Was it you, Bruce?
- Yes, actually.

358
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:24,128
I wanted to convey sheer size.

359
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,006
And size means stability, luxury...

360
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:29,341
and above all, strength.

361
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:32,803
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

362
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:35,347
His ideas about
the male preoccupation with size...

363
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:37,933
might be of particular interest to you.

364
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,478
What's gotten into you?

365
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:41,770
Excuse me.

366
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:47,776
I do apologize.

367
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,821
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

368
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,491
I may have to start minding
what she reads from now on...

369
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:54,992
won't I, Mrs. Brown?

370
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,578
Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger?

371
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,092
The ship is nice?

372
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,844
Yeah, it's an Irish ship.

373
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:15,221
Is English, no?

374
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:18,098
No, it was built in Ireland.
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

375
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,684
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

376
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,853
Well, that's typical.

377
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:25,815
First-class dogs come down here
to take a shit.

378
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:28,692
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

379
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,611
Like we could forget.

380
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:33,280
I'm Tommy Ryan.

381
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,865
- Jack Dawson.
- Hello.

382
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:36,492
- Fabrizio.
- Hi.

383
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:40,079
Do you make any money
with your drawings?

384
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,923
Forget it, boyo.

385
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,801
You'd as like have angels
fly out of your arse...

386
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:56,220
as get next to the likes of her.

387
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:23,455
<i>I saw my whole life
as if I'd already lived it.</i>

388
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:27,459
<i>An endless parade of parties
and cotillions...</i>

389
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,879
<i>yachts and polo matches.</i>

390
00:36:30,546 --> 00:36:34,758
<i>Always the same narrow people,
the same mindless chatter.</i>

391
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,096
<i>I felt like I was standing at
a great precipice...</i>

392
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:42,308
<i>with no one to pull me back.</i>

393
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:44,310
<i>No one who cared...</i>

394
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,395
<i>or even noticed.</i>

395
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:38,924
Don't do it.

396
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,759
Stay back.

397
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,596
Don't come any closer.

398
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:47,099
Come on. Just give me your hand,
I'll pull you back over.

399
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,101
No! Stay where you are.

400
00:38:49,602 --> 00:38:51,020
I mean it.

401
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:52,938
I'll let go.

402
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,701
No, you won't.

403
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:09,079
What do you mean, no I won't?

404
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:13,250
Don't presume to tell me what I will
and will not do. You don't know me.

405
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:15,920
Well, you would have done it already.

406
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,506
You're distracting me. Go away.

407
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:20,674
I can't. I'm involved now.

408
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:25,054
You let go, and I'm going to have to
jump in there after you.

409
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:28,808
Don't be absurd.

410
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:31,769
- You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.

411
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:33,813
The fall alone will kill you.

412
00:39:33,896 --> 00:39:36,649
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't.

413
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:39,318
To tell you the truth,
I'm a lot more concerned...

414
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:41,570
about that water being so cold.

415
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,329
How cold?

416
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:53,457
Freezing. Maybe a couple of degrees over.

417
00:39:58,504 --> 00:40:01,132
<i>You ever... You ever been to Wisconsin?</i>

418
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:05,886
What?

419
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:08,848
They have some of the coldest
winters around.

420
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,392
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

421
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,770
I remember, when I was a kid,
me and my father...

422
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:17,439
we went ice fishing out on Lake Wissota.

423
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,777
- Ice fishing is, you know, where you...
- I know what ice fishing is.

424
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,779
Sorry.

425
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:28,576
You just seem like,
you know, kind of an indoor girl.

426
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:31,871
<i>Anyway, I...</i>

427
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:35,040
I fell through some thin ice.

428
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,834
And I'm telling you...

429
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:39,795
water that cold...

430
00:40:40,129 --> 00:40:42,047
like right down there...

431
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:46,635
it hits you like a thousand knives
stabbing you all over your body.

432
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:50,222
You can't breathe. You can't think.

433
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,351
Least, not about anything but the pain.

434
00:40:57,146 --> 00:41:00,983
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

435
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,235
Like I said...

436
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:06,030
I don't have a choice.

437
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:12,870
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll come back
over the rail...

438
00:41:12,953 --> 00:41:14,872
and get me off the hook here.

439
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,707
You're crazy.

440
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,085
That's what everybody says...

441
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:23,506
but with all due respect, miss...

442
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,634
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

443
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:28,344
Come on.

444
00:41:29,094 --> 00:41:30,805
Give me your hand.

445
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:33,307
You don't want to do this.

446
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:50,574
I'm Jack Dawson.

447
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,078
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

448
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:57,081
I'll have to get you to write that one down.

449
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,500
Come on.

450
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,674
I got you. Come on.

451
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,717
Come on!

452
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:14,849
Help, please!

453
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:20,938
- Please, help me!
- Listen to me. I've got you.

454
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,731
I won't let go.

455
00:42:22,815 --> 00:42:25,025
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

456
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:29,780
Come on. That's right.

457
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,949
You can do it.

458
00:42:36,412 --> 00:42:37,788
I got you.

459
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:45,087
What's all this?

460
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,345
You stand back! And don't move an inch!

461
00:42:55,764 --> 00:42:57,349
Fetch the master-at-arms.

462
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:01,770
This is completely unacceptable.

463
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:05,691
What made you think you could
put your hands on my fianc?e?

464
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:07,776
Look at me, you filth!

465
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,945
- Cal.
- What do you think you were doing?

466
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:12,281
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

467
00:43:13,407 --> 00:43:14,783
An accident?

468
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:16,702
It was.

469
00:43:17,953 --> 00:43:19,413
Stupid, really.

470
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,832
I was leaning over and I slipped.

471
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,046
<i>I was leaning far over to see the...</i>

472
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:34,094
- Propellers?
- Propellers, and I slipped.

473
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:38,098
And I would have gone overboard,
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

474
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:40,518
And almost went over himself.

475
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,937
She wanted to see the propellers.

476
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,940
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

477
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,776
Was that the way of it?

478
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:53,656
Yeah, that was pretty much it.

479
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,784
Well, the boy's a hero, then.
Good for you, son. Well done.

480
00:43:57,076 --> 00:43:59,995
So, it's all's well and back to our brandy?

481
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:04,834
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

482
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,671
Perhaps a little something for the boy?

483
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:11,882
Of course.

484
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:13,717
Mr. Lovejoy...

485
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,095
I think $20 should do it.

486
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,807
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

487
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,309
Rose is displeased.

488
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:24,395
What to do?

489
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,230
I know.

490
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,819
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening.

491
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:36,532
To regale our group with your heroic tale.

492
00:44:39,368 --> 00:44:41,162
Sure. Count me in.

493
00:44:41,704 --> 00:44:43,622
Good. It's settled then.

494
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:47,126
This should be interesting.

495
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:57,887
Can I bum a smoke?

496
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:09,356
You'll want to tie those.

497
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,278
It's interesting.
The young lady slipped so suddenly...

498
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:18,073
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

499
00:45:33,923 --> 00:45:36,175
I know you've been melancholy.

500
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,386
I don't pretend to know why.

501
00:45:41,931 --> 00:45:43,891
I intended to save this...

502
00:45:44,016 --> 00:45:48,896
until the engagement gala next week.

503
00:45:50,397 --> 00:45:54,735
But I thought, tonight.

504
00:45:55,569 --> 00:45:57,029
Good gracious!

505
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:00,783
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

506
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,160
- Is it a...
- Diamond? Yes.

507
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,290
56 carats to be exact.

508
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:12,878
It was worn by Louis XVI.

509
00:46:13,796 --> 00:46:16,340
<i>And they called it Le Coeur de la Mer.</i>

510
00:46:16,465 --> 00:46:19,885
- The Heart of the Ocean.
- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

511
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,767
It's overwhelming.

512
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:28,936
It's for royalty.

513
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,897
We are royalty, Rose.

514
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:39,196
You know, there is nothing
I couldn't give you.

515
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,532
There is nothing I'd deny you...

516
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:43,868
if you would not deny me.

517
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,583
Open your heart to me, Rose.

518
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:08,726
I've been on my own since I was 15.

519
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:10,519
Since my folks died.

520
00:47:11,312 --> 00:47:15,232
And I had no brothers or sisters
or close kin in that part of the country.

521
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,569
So I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

522
00:47:18,611 --> 00:47:22,031
You can just call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

523
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:28,037
Well, Rose, we've walked
about a mile around this boat deck...

524
00:47:28,787 --> 00:47:32,124
chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up...

525
00:47:32,374 --> 00:47:36,003
but I reckon that's not
why you came to talk to me, is it?

526
00:47:37,213 --> 00:47:38,964
- Mr. Dawson, I...
- Jack.

527
00:47:40,174 --> 00:47:41,383
Jack...

528
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:44,428
I want to thank you for what you did.

529
00:47:45,554 --> 00:47:48,349
Not just for pulling me back...

530
00:47:49,058 --> 00:47:51,811
- but for your discretion.
- You're welcome.

531
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,646
Look...

532
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,690
I know what you must be thinking:

533
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:00,611
"Poor little rich girl.
What does she know about misery?"

534
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:02,363
No.

535
00:48:03,823 --> 00:48:05,491
That's not what I was thinking.

536
00:48:05,908 --> 00:48:07,368
What I was thinking was...

537
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:11,288
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

538
00:48:12,915 --> 00:48:14,333
<i>Well, I...</i>

539
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:16,669
It was everything.

540
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:20,089
It was my whole world
and all the people in it.

541
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:22,508
And the inertia of my life...

542
00:48:22,842 --> 00:48:25,803
plunging ahead,
and me, powerless to stop it.

543
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,514
God, look at that thing.

544
00:48:28,764 --> 00:48:31,267
You'd have gone straight to the bottom.

545
00:48:32,726 --> 00:48:35,437
Five hundred invitations have gone out.

546
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:38,315
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

547
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,734
And all the while, I feel...

548
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:43,195
I'm standing in the middle of
a crowded room...

549
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:46,323
screaming at the top of my lungs,
and no one even looks up.

550
00:48:47,783 --> 00:48:49,368
Do you love him?

551
00:48:50,202 --> 00:48:51,537
Pardon me?

552
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,164
Do you love him?

553
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:56,917
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

554
00:48:57,001 --> 00:49:00,296
It's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

555
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:03,966
This is not a suitable conversation.

556
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:06,719
Why can't you just answer the question?

557
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:09,513
This is absurd.

558
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,599
You don't know me and I don't know you...

559
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,185
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

560
00:49:14,268 --> 00:49:17,229
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous...

561
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:18,731
and I am leaving now.

562
00:49:18,814 --> 00:49:21,484
Jack, Mr. Dawson, it's been a pleasure.

563
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:24,028
I sought you out to thank you
and now I have thanked you...

564
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:26,030
And you've insulted me.

565
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:27,740
Well, you deserved it.

566
00:49:27,823 --> 00:49:29,325
- Right.
- Right.

567
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:34,705
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am.

568
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,210
You are so annoying.

569
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:42,463
Wait, I don't have to leave.

570
00:49:42,505 --> 00:49:45,216
This is my part of the ship. You leave.

571
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:48,803
Well, well, well! Now who's being rude?

572
00:49:53,015 --> 00:49:56,185
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

573
00:49:57,102 --> 00:49:59,814
So, what are you, an artist or something?

574
00:50:03,651 --> 00:50:05,569
These are rather good.

575
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,534
They're very good, actually.

576
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,918
Jack, this is exquisite work.

577
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:23,879
They didn't think too much
of them in old Paree.

578
00:50:23,963 --> 00:50:25,089
Paris?

579
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:28,676
<i>You do get around for a...</i>

580
00:50:31,887 --> 00:50:34,056
A person of limited means.

581
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,475
Go on, a poor guy. You can say it.

582
00:50:40,062 --> 00:50:41,605
Well, well, well.

583
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,571
And these were drawn from life?

584
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:53,534
That's one of the good things about Paris.

585
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:56,745
Lots of girls willing to take
their clothes off.

586
00:51:01,834 --> 00:51:03,669
You liked this woman.

587
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:06,046
You used her several times.

588
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:11,427
She had beautiful hands, you see?

589
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:15,848
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.

590
00:51:15,931 --> 00:51:18,267
No. Just with her hands.

591
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,228
She was a one-legged prostitute.

592
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:23,606
See?

593
00:51:29,904 --> 00:51:32,615
She had a good sense of humor, though.

594
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:36,285
And this lady...

595
00:51:37,286 --> 00:51:39,830
she used to sit at this bar every night...

596
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:42,541
wearing every piece of jewelry
she owned...

597
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:45,127
just waiting for her long lost love.

598
00:51:45,628 --> 00:51:47,838
We called her Madame Bijoux.

599
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:50,800
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

600
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:54,178
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

601
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,263
You do.

602
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,725
- You see people.
- I see you.

603
00:52:02,228 --> 00:52:03,312
And?

604
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:07,191
You wouldn't have jumped.

605
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,074
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

606
00:52:15,324 --> 00:52:17,326
Rose has already done that.

607
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:20,204
Look, here comes that vulgar
Brown woman.

608
00:52:20,454 --> 00:52:23,165
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

609
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:26,877
Hello, girls.
I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

610
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:29,171
We're awfully sorry. You missed it.

611
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:32,299
The Countess and I were just off
to take the air on the boat deck.

612
00:52:32,341 --> 00:52:35,678
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

613
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,182
Countess.

614
00:52:41,642 --> 00:52:44,436
You've not yet lit the last four boilers?

615
00:52:44,854 --> 00:52:46,814
No, I don't see the need.

616
00:52:46,856 --> 00:52:49,066
We are making excellent time.

617
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,652
<i>The press knows the size of Titanic.</i>

618
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:54,196
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

619
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:57,032
We must give them
something new to print.

620
00:52:58,617 --> 00:53:01,829
<i>This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.</i>

621
00:53:03,038 --> 00:53:04,540
Mr. Ismay...

622
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:09,837
I would prefer not to push the engines
until they've been properly run in.

623
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:12,173
Of course, I'm just a passenger.

624
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:15,050
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

625
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:17,803
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing...

626
00:53:17,887 --> 00:53:21,307
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

627
00:53:21,348 --> 00:53:23,392
Make the morning papers.

628
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:25,728
Retire with a bang, eh, E. J?

629
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:30,691
Good man.

630
00:53:31,692 --> 00:53:34,320
After that, I worked on a squid boat
in Monterey...

631
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:37,907
then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica...

632
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:41,368
and started doing portraits there
for 10 cents apiece.

633
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,704
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

634
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:47,291
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

635
00:53:49,168 --> 00:53:52,129
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...

636
00:53:52,213 --> 00:53:54,840
even if we only ever just talk about it.

637
00:53:54,924 --> 00:53:57,718
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer...

638
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,930
we'll ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

639
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:04,225
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

640
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:08,479
But you'll have to do it like a real cowboy,
none of that sidesaddle stuff.

641
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:11,440
- You mean, one leg on each side?
- Yeah.

642
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,611
- Can you show me?
- Sure, if you like.

643
00:54:17,571 --> 00:54:19,490
Teach me to ride like a man.

644
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:21,492
And chew tobacco like a man.

645
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:24,203
And spit like a man.

646
00:54:24,286 --> 00:54:26,789
What, they didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

647
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:27,957
No.

648
00:54:28,624 --> 00:54:30,876
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

649
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,378
I'll show you how, come on.

650
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,296
- Jack, no.
- Come on.

651
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:36,382
- No. Wait, Jack.
- Come on.

652
00:54:36,715 --> 00:54:39,051
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.

653
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:40,636
Watch closely.

654
00:54:42,596 --> 00:54:44,265
That's disgusting.

655
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:46,350
All right, your turn.

656
00:54:47,643 --> 00:54:50,187
That was pitiful.
Come on, you really gotta hawk it back.

657
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:52,982
Get some leverage to it, use your arms...

658
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,525
arc your neck.

659
00:54:55,317 --> 00:54:57,653
You see the range on that thing?

660
00:54:58,154 --> 00:54:59,655
Okay, go.

661
00:55:02,783 --> 00:55:05,119
- That was better. You got to work on it.
- Really?

662
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:09,039
<i>Really try to hawk it up
and get some body to it. You gotta...</i>

663
00:55:15,963 --> 00:55:17,131
Mother.

664
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:24,680
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

665
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,808
Charmed, I'm sure.

666
00:55:32,813 --> 00:55:35,316
<i>The others were gracious and curious...</i>

667
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:37,776
<i>about the man who'd saved my life.</i>

668
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,780
<i>But my mother looked at him
like an insect.</i>

669
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:46,035
<i>A dangerous insect
which must be squashed quickly.</i>

670
00:55:46,702 --> 00:55:50,873
Jack, sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

671
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:55,753
Why do they always insist on
announcing dinner...

672
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,922
like a damn cavalry charge?

673
00:55:58,339 --> 00:56:00,424
Shall we go dress, Mother?

674
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:03,052
See you at dinner, Jack.

675
00:56:05,054 --> 00:56:06,096
Son?

676
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,473
Son!

677
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:11,560
Do you have the slightest comprehension
of what you're doing?

678
00:56:11,644 --> 00:56:12,770
Not really.

679
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:15,397
You're about to go into the snake pit.

680
00:56:17,566 --> 00:56:19,819
What are you planning to wear?

681
00:56:22,488 --> 00:56:24,240
I figured. Come on.

682
00:56:27,034 --> 00:56:28,577
I was right.

683
00:56:29,036 --> 00:56:31,539
You and my son
are just about the same size.

684
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:33,123
Pretty close.

685
00:56:37,086 --> 00:56:39,296
You shine up like a new penny.

686
00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:52,935
Good evening, sir.

687
00:57:56,874 --> 00:58:00,085
There are several thousand tons
of Hockley steel in this very ship.

688
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:02,421
- Which part?
- All the right ones, of course.

689
00:58:02,505 --> 00:58:05,049
Then we'll know who to hold accountable
if there's a problem.

690
00:58:05,132 --> 00:58:07,384
- Where's my daughter?
- She'll be along.

691
00:58:07,468 --> 00:58:09,303
There is the Countess.

692
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:11,222
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.

693
00:58:11,305 --> 00:58:13,224
So good to see you.

694
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:42,419
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

695
00:58:54,306 --> 00:58:56,058
I'll see you at dinner.

696
00:58:56,392 --> 00:58:57,685
Darling...

697
00:58:58,144 --> 00:59:00,396
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

698
00:59:00,729 --> 00:59:02,064
Dawson.

699
00:59:03,065 --> 00:59:04,567
That's amazing.

700
00:59:04,984 --> 00:59:07,611
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

701
00:59:07,945 --> 00:59:09,155
Almost.

702
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:11,073
Extraordinary.

703
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:25,421
My dear, it's delightful to see you.

704
00:59:25,588 --> 00:59:26,881
What a remarkable voyage this is.

705
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:29,508
- It's mad, isn't it?
- Completely lunatic.

706
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:32,887
There's the Countess of Rothes.

707
00:59:35,764 --> 00:59:38,017
And that's John Jacob Astor...

708
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:40,102
the richest man on the ship.

709
00:59:40,186 --> 00:59:44,190
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age, and in a delicate condition.

710
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:46,817
See how she's trying to hide it?

711
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:48,527
Quite the scandal.

712
00:59:49,028 --> 00:59:52,615
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress, Madame Aubert.

713
00:59:52,698 --> 00:59:55,910
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, of course.

714
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:59,580
And over here, we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.

715
00:59:59,663 --> 01:00:02,958
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

716
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:05,586
Very popular with the royals.

717
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,964
Congratulations, Hockley. She's splendid.

718
01:00:09,048 --> 01:00:10,508
Why, thank you.

719
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:14,094
- Care to escort a lady to dinner?
- Certainly.

720
01:00:15,638 --> 01:00:17,223
Sweet pea?

721
01:00:18,432 --> 01:00:21,560
Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack?
Remember, they love money.

722
01:00:21,644 --> 01:00:24,855
So just pretend like you own a gold mine
and you're in the club.

723
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:28,692
Hey, Astor.

724
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:32,154
Hello, Molly, nice to see you.

725
01:00:32,655 --> 01:00:35,282
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

726
01:00:35,366 --> 01:00:36,867
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

727
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:38,494
Well, Jack...

728
01:00:38,828 --> 01:00:41,121
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

729
01:00:41,539 --> 01:00:44,250
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

730
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:45,543
Oh, yes.

731
01:00:47,628 --> 01:00:50,923
<i>He must have been nervous,
but he never faltered.</i>

732
01:00:52,383 --> 01:00:54,677
<i>They assumed he was one of them.</i>

733
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:57,429
<i>Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.</i>

734
01:00:58,472 --> 01:01:01,892
<i>New money, obviously,
but still a member of the club.</i>

735
01:01:03,352 --> 01:01:06,480
<i>Mother, of course,
could always be counted upon.</i>

736
01:01:07,356 --> 01:01:10,484
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

737
01:01:10,568 --> 01:01:12,403
I hear they're quite good on this ship.

738
01:01:13,779 --> 01:01:16,657
The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.

739
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:22,830
Mr. Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

740
01:01:22,872 --> 01:01:25,416
He was of some assistance
to my fianc?e last night.

741
01:01:25,499 --> 01:01:28,377
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

742
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:31,589
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

743
01:01:31,672 --> 01:01:34,800
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

744
01:01:34,884 --> 01:01:37,052
Not to impugn your work, sir.

745
01:01:47,313 --> 01:01:48,606
Are these all for me?

746
01:01:48,689 --> 01:01:50,774
Just start from the outside
and work your way in.

747
01:01:50,858 --> 01:01:53,235
He knows every rivet in her,
don't you, Thomas?

748
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:55,821
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.

749
01:01:55,988 --> 01:01:57,573
Thank you, Rose.

750
01:02:00,534 --> 01:02:02,077
How do you take your caviar, sir?

751
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:03,996
No caviar for me, thanks.

752
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:05,998
Never did like it much.

753
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:10,085
And where exactly do you live,
Mr. Dawson?

754
01:02:10,252 --> 01:02:13,214
<i>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.</i>

755
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:16,091
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

756
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:18,844
And how is it you have means to travel?

757
01:02:18,928 --> 01:02:21,138
I work my way from place to place.

758
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,474
You know, tramp steamers and such.

759
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:27,102
<i>But I won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.</i>

760
01:02:27,269 --> 01:02:28,938
A very lucky hand.

761
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,816
All life is a game of luck.

762
01:02:33,025 --> 01:02:35,986
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.
Right, Dawson?

763
01:02:37,446 --> 01:02:41,367
And you find that sort
of rootless existence appealing, do you?

764
01:02:44,411 --> 01:02:46,038
Yes, ma'am, I do.

765
01:02:46,664 --> 01:02:49,959
I mean, I've got everything I need
right here with me.

766
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:53,462
I got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

767
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:57,424
I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's gonna happen...

768
01:02:57,758 --> 01:02:59,593
or who I'm gonna meet...

769
01:02:59,677 --> 01:03:01,512
where I'm gonna wind up.

770
01:03:01,595 --> 01:03:04,306
Just the other night I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now...

771
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,642
here I am
on the grandest ship in the world...

772
01:03:06,725 --> 01:03:08,477
having champagne with you fine people.

773
01:03:08,561 --> 01:03:10,396
I'll take some more of that.

774
01:03:10,813 --> 01:03:14,483
I figure life is a gift
and I don't intend on wasting it.

775
01:03:14,984 --> 01:03:17,695
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

776
01:03:17,778 --> 01:03:20,030
You learn to take life as it comes at you.

777
01:03:20,114 --> 01:03:21,699
Here you go, Cal.

778
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:24,994
To make each day count.

779
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:27,955
- Well said, Jack.
- Hear, hear.

780
01:03:28,956 --> 01:03:30,791
To making it count.

781
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:33,752
To making it count!

782
01:03:34,378 --> 01:03:35,588
Bravo.

783
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:45,973
But Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

784
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:51,353
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating, and he lights a fire.

785
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:55,107
Bravo.

786
01:03:55,191 --> 01:03:57,985
Next it'll be brandies in the smoking room.

787
01:03:59,445 --> 01:04:02,573
- Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
- What a good idea.

788
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:06,410
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke
and congratulate each other...

789
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:08,120
on being masters of the universe.

790
01:04:08,204 --> 01:04:11,248
Ladies, thank you for the pleasure
of your company.

791
01:04:11,332 --> 01:04:12,917
Rose, may I escort you to the cabin?

792
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,752
No, I'll stay here.

793
01:04:15,002 --> 01:04:16,754
Here you go, Molly.

794
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:19,006
Joining us, Dawson?

795
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:22,468
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, do you?

796
01:04:22,551 --> 01:04:25,930
- No, thanks, I've got to be heading back.
- Probably best.

797
01:04:26,013 --> 01:04:28,557
It'll be all business and politics,
that sort of thing.

798
01:04:28,641 --> 01:04:30,476
Wouldn't interest you.

799
01:04:30,643 --> 01:04:32,102
But, Dawson...

800
01:04:32,561 --> 01:04:34,271
good of you to come.

801
01:04:38,984 --> 01:04:40,444
Jack, must you go?

802
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:43,405
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

803
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,827
Good night, Rose.

804
01:05:27,825 --> 01:05:30,077
So you want to go to a real party?

805
01:05:40,754 --> 01:05:43,299
Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay.

806
01:05:58,397 --> 01:05:59,523
What?

807
01:06:02,234 --> 01:06:04,153
I can't understand you.

808
01:06:36,852 --> 01:06:39,396
I'm going to dance with her now, all right?

809
01:06:39,438 --> 01:06:40,689
Come on.

810
01:06:40,773 --> 01:06:42,233
- What?
- Come on.

811
01:06:42,316 --> 01:06:44,777
- Come with me.
- Jack! Jack, wait.

812
01:06:47,446 --> 01:06:48,697
I can't do this.

813
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:52,243
We're gonna have to get
a little bit closer, like this.

814
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:57,540
You're still my best girl, Cora.

815
01:07:00,209 --> 01:07:03,546
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do I, just go with it.

816
01:07:03,629 --> 01:07:05,005
Don't think.

817
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:26,819
Wait, Jack! Stop!

818
01:07:36,537 --> 01:07:38,038
Stop! Wait!

819
01:08:19,371 --> 01:08:21,123
Jack, no.

820
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:29,215
...beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

821
01:08:29,298 --> 01:08:31,050
So my lawyers will argue.

822
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:34,595
That's what Rockefeller said, but
the Supreme Court is not swallowing it.

823
01:08:54,824 --> 01:08:55,908
What?

824
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:58,744
You think a first-class girl can't drink?

825
01:09:00,913 --> 01:09:02,498
Get out of here.

826
01:09:02,581 --> 01:09:04,250
You all right?

827
01:09:05,876 --> 01:09:07,002
I'm fine.

828
01:09:07,086 --> 01:09:08,754
Two out of three.

829
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:11,257
So...

830
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:14,927
you think you're big tough men?

831
01:09:15,761 --> 01:09:17,680
Let's see you do this.

832
01:09:19,515 --> 01:09:22,059
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

833
01:09:39,827 --> 01:09:41,579
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

834
01:09:41,662 --> 01:09:44,915
- Are you all right?
- I haven't done that in years.

835
01:10:21,118 --> 01:10:22,536
Coffee, sir?

836
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:35,049
I had hoped you would come to me
last night.

837
01:10:36,258 --> 01:10:37,635
I was tired.

838
01:10:40,513 --> 01:10:43,974
Your exertions below decks were,
no doubt, exhausting.

839
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:49,980
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

840
01:10:50,064 --> 01:10:53,984
You will never behave like that again,
Rose, do you understand?

841
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,990
I'm not a foreman in one of your mills
that you can command.

842
01:11:00,991 --> 01:11:02,660
I'm your fianc?e.

843
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:06,997
My fianc?e!

844
01:11:07,248 --> 01:11:09,250
Yes, you are, and my wife!

845
01:11:09,959 --> 01:11:14,213
My wife in practice, if not yet by law.
So you will honor me.

846
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:17,800
You'll honor me the way a wife is required
to honor her husband.

847
01:11:17,842 --> 01:11:20,719
Because I will not be made
out a fool, Rose.

848
01:11:20,803 --> 01:11:22,930
Is this in any way unclear?

849
01:11:23,681 --> 01:11:24,723
No.

850
01:11:25,057 --> 01:11:27,518
Good. Excuse me.

851
01:11:33,149 --> 01:11:34,483
Miss Rose.

852
01:11:36,277 --> 01:11:38,988
- We had a little accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.

853
01:11:39,071 --> 01:11:40,739
- Sorry, Trudy.
- It's all right.

854
01:11:40,781 --> 01:11:42,116
Let me help you.

855
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:44,034
It's all right, miss.

856
01:11:49,999 --> 01:11:51,500
It's all right, miss.

857
01:11:57,381 --> 01:11:59,925
- Tea, Trudy.
- Yes, ma'am.

858
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:19,403
You are not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me?

859
01:12:20,613 --> 01:12:22,948
Rose, I forbid it.

860
01:12:23,991 --> 01:12:27,203
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

861
01:12:27,286 --> 01:12:29,038
This is not a game.

862
01:12:29,455 --> 01:12:31,624
Our situation is precarious.

863
01:12:31,707 --> 01:12:33,292
You know the money's gone.

864
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,461
Of course I know it's gone.

865
01:12:35,961 --> 01:12:38,005
You remind me every day.

866
01:12:39,173 --> 01:12:43,969
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

867
01:12:44,512 --> 01:12:47,264
That name is the only card
we have to play.

868
01:12:47,807 --> 01:12:49,725
I don't understand you.

869
01:12:50,059 --> 01:12:53,896
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

870
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:57,441
How can you put this on my shoulders?

871
01:12:57,525 --> 01:12:59,360
Why are you being so selfish?

872
01:12:59,443 --> 01:13:01,111
I'm being selfish?

873
01:13:04,573 --> 01:13:07,618
Do you want to see me working
as a seamstress?

874
01:13:09,328 --> 01:13:11,247
Is that what you want?

875
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:16,460
To see our fine things sold at auction?

876
01:13:18,379 --> 01:13:20,840
Our memories scattered to the winds?

877
01:13:31,308 --> 01:13:32,977
It's so unfair.

878
01:13:34,645 --> 01:13:36,564
Of course it's unfair.

879
01:13:37,565 --> 01:13:38,983
We're women.

880
01:13:41,485 --> 01:13:43,571
Our choices are never easy.

881
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:09,472
<i>Protect them by Thy guiding hand</i>

882
01:14:09,555 --> 01:14:14,560
<i>From every peril on the land</i>

883
01:14:16,187 --> 01:14:20,774
<i>O spirit whom the Father sent</i>

884
01:14:21,025 --> 01:14:25,112
<i>To spread abroad the firmament</i>

885
01:14:25,529 --> 01:14:29,909
<i>O wind of heaven, by Thy might</i>

886
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:34,955
<i>Save all who dare the eagle's flight</i>

887
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:39,210
<i>And keep them by Thy watchful</i>

888
01:14:41,962 --> 01:14:44,423
- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
- Hello, Jack.

889
01:14:53,432 --> 01:14:55,309
I just need to talk to somebody
for a second.

890
01:14:55,434 --> 01:14:58,938
- Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.
- I just need to speak to someone.

891
01:15:02,024 --> 01:15:04,026
I was just here last night,
you don't remember me?

892
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:05,194
No, I'm afraid I don't.

893
01:15:05,277 --> 01:15:07,822
- Now, you're gonna have to turn around.
- He'll tell you.

894
01:15:07,947 --> 01:15:09,406
I just need to talk...

895
01:15:09,448 --> 01:15:12,326
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater...

896
01:15:12,993 --> 01:15:15,704
continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

897
01:15:15,996 --> 01:15:19,625
They asked me to give you this
in gratitude.

898
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:21,418
I don't want your money. Please. I just...

899
01:15:21,502 --> 01:15:24,839
Also to remind you
that you hold a third-class ticket...

900
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,758
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.

901
01:15:27,842 --> 01:15:29,927
Please, I just wanna speak to Rose
for one second.

902
01:15:30,052 --> 01:15:33,848
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
gets back to where he belongs...

903
01:15:34,014 --> 01:15:35,975
and that he stays there.

904
01:15:36,267 --> 01:15:38,394
Yes, sir. Come along, you.

905
01:15:40,896 --> 01:15:43,649
<i>Hear us when we cry to Thee</i>

906
01:15:43,941 --> 01:15:48,904
<i>For those in peril on the sea</i>

907
01:15:49,822 --> 01:15:51,949
And why do you have
two steering wheels?

908
01:15:51,991 --> 01:15:54,493
- We really only use this near shore.
- Excuse me, sir.

909
01:15:54,618 --> 01:15:57,288
<i>Another ice warning.
This one is from the Noordam.</i>

910
01:15:57,413 --> 01:15:59,039
Thank you, Sparks.

911
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,628
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

912
01:16:05,212 --> 01:16:09,133
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

913
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:16,432
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

914
01:16:16,515 --> 01:16:18,267
Okay, now, let it go.

915
01:16:24,356 --> 01:16:26,025
That's excellent.

916
01:16:30,237 --> 01:16:32,865
Mr. Andrews, forgive me...

917
01:16:33,699 --> 01:16:35,743
I did the sum in my head...

918
01:16:35,743 --> 01:16:39,705
<i>and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...</i>

919
01:16:39,789 --> 01:16:43,709
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

920
01:16:43,793 --> 01:16:45,586
About half, actually.

921
01:16:46,295 --> 01:16:48,672
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

922
01:16:48,756 --> 01:16:51,175
In fact, I put in these new-type davits...

923
01:16:51,342 --> 01:16:54,595
which can take an extra row of boats
inside this one.

924
01:16:54,637 --> 01:16:56,931
But it was thought, by some...

925
01:16:56,972 --> 01:16:58,933
the deck would look too cluttered.

926
01:16:59,016 --> 01:17:00,768
So, I was overruled.

927
01:17:01,435 --> 01:17:04,647
It's a waste of deck space as it is
in an unsinkable ship.

928
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:06,649
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

929
01:17:06,732 --> 01:17:09,693
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

930
01:17:09,777 --> 01:17:11,612
She's all the lifeboat you need.

931
01:17:11,695 --> 01:17:14,865
Keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.

932
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:16,200
Come on.

933
01:17:21,372 --> 01:17:24,458
Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.

934
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:26,919
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack. No.

935
01:17:28,963 --> 01:17:30,881
Jack, I'm engaged.

936
01:17:32,216 --> 01:17:33,884
I'm marrying Cal.

937
01:17:34,885 --> 01:17:36,220
I love Cal.

938
01:17:40,099 --> 01:17:42,560
Rose, you're no picnic, all right?

939
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,062
You're a spoiled little brat, even.

940
01:17:45,229 --> 01:17:48,190
But under that,
you're the most amazingly...

941
01:17:48,691 --> 01:17:51,152
<i>astounding, wonderful girl...</i>

942
01:17:51,777 --> 01:17:54,530
Woman that I've ever known and...

943
01:17:54,572 --> 01:17:56,866
- Jack, I...
- No, let me try to get this out.

944
01:17:56,949 --> 01:17:58,367
<i>You're...</i>

945
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:03,706
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

946
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:05,666
I've got $10 in my pocket.

947
01:18:05,749 --> 01:18:08,669
I have nothing to offer you
and I know that.

948
01:18:08,961 --> 01:18:10,421
I understand.

949
01:18:11,547 --> 01:18:13,507
But I'm too involved now.

950
01:18:13,632 --> 01:18:15,634
You jump, I jump, remember?

951
01:18:15,676 --> 01:18:19,138
I can't turn away without knowing
you'll be all right.

952
01:18:19,722 --> 01:18:21,640
That's all that I want.

953
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,185
Well, I'm fine.

954
01:18:25,186 --> 01:18:27,146
I'll be fine. Really.

955
01:18:28,606 --> 01:18:29,815
Really?

956
01:18:31,734 --> 01:18:33,360
I don't think so.

957
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:36,155
They have got you trapped, Rose.

958
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,324
And you're gonna die
if you don't break free.

959
01:18:38,449 --> 01:18:41,368
Maybe not right away,
because you're strong...

960
01:18:42,328 --> 01:18:46,123
but sooner or later,
that fire that I love about you, Rose...

961
01:18:46,123 --> 01:18:48,334
that fire's going to burn out.

962
01:18:53,506 --> 01:18:56,050
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

963
01:18:57,426 --> 01:18:58,928
You're right.

964
01:19:00,054 --> 01:19:01,889
Only you can do that.

965
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:10,648
I'm going back. Leave me alone.

966
01:19:23,035 --> 01:19:26,288
Tell Lucile about the disaster you had
with the stationers.

967
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:29,083
Of course, the invitations had to be
sent back, twice.

968
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:32,211
- Oh, my dear.
- And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

969
01:19:32,294 --> 01:19:34,797
Let me tell you,
what an odyssey that has been.

970
01:19:34,922 --> 01:19:38,801
Rose decided she wanted lavender.
She knows I detest the color.

971
01:19:38,843 --> 01:19:40,970
She did it to spite me.

972
01:19:41,053 --> 01:19:43,222
If only you'd come to me sooner.

973
01:19:43,389 --> 01:19:45,683
<i>Ruth saw some of my designs
in La Mode Illustr?e...</i>

974
01:19:45,808 --> 01:19:46,976
they were for the trousseau...

975
01:19:47,059 --> 01:19:50,187
of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest
daughter. They were quite charming.

976
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:52,606
I think you'll agree, my dear,
that together...

977
01:19:53,315 --> 01:19:56,152
we've created something of a phoenix
from the ashes.

978
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:12,334
Hello, Jack.

979
01:20:17,882 --> 01:20:19,508
I changed my mind.

980
01:20:25,723 --> 01:20:27,892
They said you might be up here...

981
01:20:29,643 --> 01:20:31,395
Give me your hand.

982
01:20:38,527 --> 01:20:40,321
Now close your eyes.

983
01:20:41,363 --> 01:20:42,573
Go on.

984
01:20:45,868 --> 01:20:47,286
Now step up.

985
01:20:51,332 --> 01:20:54,210
Now hold on to the railing.
Keep your eyes closed.

986
01:20:54,251 --> 01:20:56,045
- Don't peek.
- I'm not.

987
01:20:57,338 --> 01:20:59,256
Step up onto the rail.

988
01:21:03,427 --> 01:21:05,513
Hold on. Hold on.

989
01:21:05,721 --> 01:21:07,598
Keep your eyes closed.

990
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:10,893
- Do you trust me?
- I trust you.

991
01:21:21,153 --> 01:21:23,948
All right, open your eyes.

992
01:21:30,955 --> 01:21:33,165
I'm flying. Jack.

993
01:21:58,858 --> 01:22:02,611
<i>Come, Josephine, in my flying machine</i>

994
01:22:02,695 --> 01:22:07,616
<i>Going up she goes
Up she goes</i>

995
01:22:55,372 --> 01:22:58,626
<i>That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.</i>

996
01:22:59,502 --> 01:23:02,296
We're up to dusk, the night of the sinking.

997
01:23:02,546 --> 01:23:04,840
- Six hours to go.
- Incredible.

998
01:23:05,007 --> 01:23:06,801
There's Smith, and he's standing there...

999
01:23:06,801 --> 01:23:09,345
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand.

1000
01:23:09,428 --> 01:23:12,264
Excuse me, his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1001
01:23:12,389 --> 01:23:15,267
Twenty-six years of experience working
against him.

1002
01:23:15,768 --> 01:23:20,105
He figures anything big enough to sink
the ship, they're gonna see in time to turn.

1003
01:23:20,189 --> 01:23:22,900
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1004
01:23:23,025 --> 01:23:25,194
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1005
01:23:25,653 --> 01:23:27,863
Everything he knows is wrong.

1006
01:23:40,543 --> 01:23:44,171
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1007
01:23:46,257 --> 01:23:48,592
- Will this light do?
- What?

1008
01:23:48,884 --> 01:23:51,137
Don't artists need good light?

1009
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:55,057
That is true, but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.

1010
01:23:56,183 --> 01:23:57,393
Monet!

1011
01:23:58,602 --> 01:24:00,855
- You know his work?
- Of course.

1012
01:24:01,313 --> 01:24:03,774
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1013
01:24:03,899 --> 01:24:05,943
I know. It's extraordinary.

1014
01:24:08,154 --> 01:24:11,574
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1015
01:24:11,991 --> 01:24:14,785
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?

1016
01:24:15,453 --> 01:24:18,456
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1017
01:24:22,168 --> 01:24:25,004
That's nice. What is it, a sapphire?

1018
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:29,008
A diamond. A very rare diamond.

1019
01:24:32,928 --> 01:24:36,599
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1020
01:24:36,932 --> 01:24:39,643
- Wearing this.
- All right.

1021
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,189
Wearing only this.

1022
01:25:18,474 --> 01:25:20,226
The last thing I need...

1023
01:25:20,309 --> 01:25:23,771
is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1024
01:25:26,607 --> 01:25:28,651
As a paying customer...

1025
01:25:30,361 --> 01:25:32,530
I expect to get what I want.

1026
01:25:50,422 --> 01:25:53,008
Over on the bed. The couch.

1027
01:26:01,809 --> 01:26:03,644
Lie down.

1028
01:26:07,606 --> 01:26:11,443
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Put your arm back the way it was.

1029
01:26:13,112 --> 01:26:16,615
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1030
01:26:18,075 --> 01:26:19,285
Right.

1031
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:21,745
Now, head down.

1032
01:26:24,165 --> 01:26:26,333
Eyes to me, keep them on me.

1033
01:26:28,419 --> 01:26:30,254
And try to stay still.

1034
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:50,566
So serious.

1035
01:27:32,525 --> 01:27:35,528
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste.

1036
01:27:39,907 --> 01:27:42,785
<i>I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.</i>

1037
01:27:43,994 --> 01:27:45,746
He does landscapes.

1038
01:27:46,622 --> 01:27:48,958
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1039
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:50,459
No laughing.

1040
01:28:21,449 --> 01:28:24,076
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1041
01:28:24,743 --> 01:28:28,289
It was the most erotic moment of my life...

1042
01:28:32,084 --> 01:28:34,211
up until then, at least.

1043
01:28:35,296 --> 01:28:37,173
So what happened next?

1044
01:28:37,882 --> 01:28:40,509
You mean, did we do it?

1045
01:28:44,305 --> 01:28:46,056
<i>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.</i>

1046
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:48,225
<i>Jack was very professional.</i>

1047
01:28:55,941 --> 01:28:57,276
Thank you.

1048
01:29:05,576 --> 01:29:07,369
What are you doing?

1049
01:29:07,787 --> 01:29:10,664
Will you put this back in the safe for me?

1050
01:29:22,384 --> 01:29:24,470
- Gentlemen, would you excuse me?
- Sure.

1051
01:29:26,555 --> 01:29:29,058
None of the stewards have seen her.

1052
01:29:29,558 --> 01:29:32,019
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1053
01:29:32,102 --> 01:29:34,480
There's only so many places she could be.

1054
01:29:34,522 --> 01:29:36,190
Lovejoy, find her.

1055
01:29:53,916 --> 01:29:55,376
- Clear.
- Yes.

1056
01:29:56,585 --> 01:29:59,672
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1057
01:30:00,965 --> 01:30:04,176
Like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.

1058
01:30:05,511 --> 01:30:08,347
It will make the 'bergs harder to see...

1059
01:30:08,597 --> 01:30:11,142
with no breaking water at the base.

1060
01:30:22,486 --> 01:30:23,946
Well, I'm off.

1061
01:30:24,071 --> 01:30:26,866
Maintain speed and heading,
Mr. Lightoller.

1062
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:28,492
Yes, sir.

1063
01:30:39,712 --> 01:30:41,380
It's getting cold.

1064
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:43,632
- You look nice.
- Miss Rose?

1065
01:30:44,633 --> 01:30:46,051
My drawings.

1066
01:31:12,411 --> 01:31:13,704
Come on, Jack!

1067
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:19,168
- Wait!
- Wait!

1068
01:31:20,336 --> 01:31:22,505
- Go!
- Take us down, quick.

1069
01:31:22,588 --> 01:31:24,089
- Go!
- Quickly! Quickly!

1070
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:30,554
Bye.

1071
01:31:38,312 --> 01:31:39,355
Sorry.

1072
01:31:44,902 --> 01:31:47,029
- Keep going.
- Thank you, I've got it.

1073
01:31:57,248 --> 01:31:59,834
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1074
01:31:59,959 --> 01:32:02,628
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.

1075
01:32:03,254 --> 01:32:04,797
- Oh, shit.
- Go!

1076
01:32:09,552 --> 01:32:12,054
- No, over here!
- Quick!

1077
01:32:19,145 --> 01:32:21,564
- Now what?
- What?

1078
01:32:27,945 --> 01:32:30,448
More coal for number one, mate.

1079
01:32:30,739 --> 01:32:33,033
What are you two doing down here?

1080
01:32:33,117 --> 01:32:35,453
You shouldn't be down here.
It could be dangerous!

1081
01:32:39,331 --> 01:32:41,625
Carry on. Don't mind us.

1082
01:32:41,709 --> 01:32:44,753
You're doing a great job.
Keep up the good work!

1083
01:33:00,644 --> 01:33:02,730
Look at what we have here.

1084
01:33:20,956 --> 01:33:22,291
Thank you.

1085
01:33:33,928 --> 01:33:35,513
Where to, miss?

1086
01:33:36,889 --> 01:33:38,349
To the stars.

1087
01:33:57,326 --> 01:33:58,786
You nervous?

1088
01:34:01,205 --> 01:34:02,289
No.

1089
01:34:19,265 --> 01:34:21,392
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1090
01:34:46,041 --> 01:34:47,626
It's bloody cold.

1091
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:50,504
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1092
01:34:52,548 --> 01:34:55,176
- Bollocks!
- Well, I can, all right?

1093
01:34:56,135 --> 01:34:58,471
Did you ever find those binoculars
for the lookouts?

1094
01:34:58,554 --> 01:35:01,098
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1095
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:03,684
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1096
01:35:35,508 --> 01:35:37,176
You're trembling.

1097
01:35:39,094 --> 01:35:41,889
Don't worry, I'll be all right.

1098
01:36:03,828 --> 01:36:06,205
- They ran down there.
- All right.

1099
01:36:15,381 --> 01:36:17,049
Anything missing?

1100
01:36:41,907 --> 01:36:43,826
I've got a better idea.

1101
01:36:56,672 --> 01:36:57,715
Gotcha!

1102
01:37:07,016 --> 01:37:09,185
Did you see those guys' faces?

1103
01:37:10,394 --> 01:37:12,062
Did you see them?

1104
01:37:18,569 --> 01:37:20,488
When the ship docks...

1105
01:37:21,864 --> 01:37:23,866
I'm getting off with you.

1106
01:37:24,742 --> 01:37:26,660
- This is crazy.
- I know.

1107
01:37:26,744 --> 01:37:28,746
It doesn't make any sense.

1108
01:37:30,289 --> 01:37:32,208
That's why I trust it.

1109
01:37:42,051 --> 01:37:43,761
Here, look at this.

1110
01:37:44,553 --> 01:37:46,472
Look at that, would you?

1111
01:37:46,555 --> 01:37:48,641
They're a bit warmer than we are.

1112
01:37:48,724 --> 01:37:51,268
If that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not...

1113
01:37:51,310 --> 01:37:53,270
if it's all the same to you, all right?

1114
01:38:05,407 --> 01:38:07,326
Bugger me!

1115
01:38:12,164 --> 01:38:13,999
Pick up, you bastards!

1116
01:38:17,294 --> 01:38:19,672
<i>- Is anyone there?
- Yes, what do you see?</i>

1117
01:38:19,755 --> 01:38:22,174
- Iceberg, right ahead!
- Thank you.

1118
01:38:24,802 --> 01:38:26,178
Iceberg, right ahead!

1119
01:38:26,262 --> 01:38:28,013
Hard to starboard!

1120
01:38:35,104 --> 01:38:37,565
Turn! Smartly!

1121
01:38:42,403 --> 01:38:43,821
Full astern!

1122
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:48,409
- Hard over.
- Helm's hard over, sir.

1123
01:38:52,246 --> 01:38:53,747
Go, lads, go!

1124
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:59,128
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

1125
01:39:01,088 --> 01:39:03,549
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1126
01:39:08,304 --> 01:39:09,638
Hold it.

1127
01:39:13,809 --> 01:39:16,145
Now! Engage the reversing engine.

1128
01:39:44,632 --> 01:39:46,467
Why ain't they turning?

1129
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:49,595
- Is it hard over?
- It is. Yes, sir, hard over.

1130
01:39:54,809 --> 01:39:58,103
Come on. Come on. Turn.

1131
01:40:08,948 --> 01:40:10,032
Yes.

1132
01:40:15,579 --> 01:40:17,164
It's gonna hit!

1133
01:40:28,592 --> 01:40:30,094
Jesus Christ!

1134
01:40:50,865 --> 01:40:52,241
Jesus.

1135
01:40:52,324 --> 01:40:54,869
- Hard to port!
- Hard to port!

1136
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,172
Get back!

1137
01:41:35,326 --> 01:41:36,827
Come on, let's go!

1138
01:41:37,536 --> 01:41:40,039
Get out of the door.
They're closing the doors!

1139
01:41:40,122 --> 01:41:41,457
Get out!

1140
01:41:47,505 --> 01:41:49,799
Get out of the door! Go!

1141
01:41:50,716 --> 01:41:53,594
Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1142
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,066
Out!

1143
01:42:21,747 --> 01:42:23,082
Oh, my God.

1144
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:26,127
That was a close shave, wasn't it?

1145
01:42:26,168 --> 01:42:28,712
Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ!

1146
01:42:33,217 --> 01:42:35,845
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1147
01:42:41,559 --> 01:42:43,769
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1148
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:45,855
An iceberg, sir.

1149
01:42:46,689 --> 01:42:50,609
I put her hard to starboard, and ran the
engines full astern, but it was too close.

1150
01:42:50,693 --> 01:42:53,028
I tried to port round it, but she hit.

1151
01:42:53,112 --> 01:42:56,449
- Close the watertight doors.
- Doors are closed, sir.

1152
01:42:59,201 --> 01:43:00,953
- All stop.
- Aye, sir.

1153
01:43:09,462 --> 01:43:11,547
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1154
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:12,840
Yes, sir.

1155
01:43:23,726 --> 01:43:25,811
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.

1156
01:43:25,895 --> 01:43:27,021
Come on, hurry up.

1157
01:43:32,067 --> 01:43:33,903
Excuse me,
why have the engines stopped?

1158
01:43:33,944 --> 01:43:36,071
- I felt a shudder.
- I shouldn't worry, madam.

1159
01:43:36,155 --> 01:43:39,200
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.
That's the shudder you felt.

1160
01:43:39,283 --> 01:43:41,202
May I bring you anything?

1161
01:43:41,243 --> 01:43:42,328
No, thank you.

1162
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:50,044
So, now there's talk of an iceberg.
Did you see anything?

1163
01:43:50,127 --> 01:43:51,962
I don't see anything now. Do you?

1164
01:43:53,881 --> 01:43:57,176
If this is the direction the rats are going,
that's good enough for me.

1165
01:44:00,137 --> 01:44:02,223
Everything's under control.

1166
01:44:04,099 --> 01:44:06,227
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1167
01:44:06,268 --> 01:44:08,020
Yes, there is. I've been robbed.

1168
01:44:08,103 --> 01:44:09,688
Get the master-at-arms.

1169
01:44:09,772 --> 01:44:11,690
- Now, you moron!
- Yes, sir.

1170
01:44:14,985 --> 01:44:16,904
Hey, did I miss the fun?

1171
01:44:18,447 --> 01:44:20,449
- Did you see what happened?
- No, I missed it.

1172
01:44:20,533 --> 01:44:22,827
Apparently, it hit over there.

1173
01:44:22,952 --> 01:44:25,663
Boiler Room 6 is flooded
8 feet above the plate...

1174
01:44:25,746 --> 01:44:27,832
and the mail hold is worse.
She's all buckled in...

1175
01:44:27,915 --> 01:44:30,126
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1176
01:44:30,167 --> 01:44:31,919
Have you seen the damage
in the mail hold?

1177
01:44:32,002 --> 01:44:34,296
No, she's already underwater.

1178
01:44:34,338 --> 01:44:35,756
This is bad.

1179
01:44:38,008 --> 01:44:39,760
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1180
01:44:40,886 --> 01:44:43,222
I think they're very good, sir.

1181
01:44:45,808 --> 01:44:49,478
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1182
01:44:53,983 --> 01:44:56,444
We've been looking for you, miss.

1183
01:45:00,698 --> 01:45:01,824
Here we go.

1184
01:45:07,997 --> 01:45:10,249
Something serious has happened.

1185
01:45:10,833 --> 01:45:12,334
Yes, it has.

1186
01:45:13,711 --> 01:45:14,753
Indeed.

1187
01:45:14,837 --> 01:45:17,298
Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1188
01:45:17,381 --> 01:45:20,593
Now that one is back, I have
a pretty good idea where to find the other.

1189
01:45:20,676 --> 01:45:21,802
Search him.

1190
01:45:21,886 --> 01:45:23,554
- Take your coat off, son.
- Now what?

1191
01:45:23,637 --> 01:45:24,930
Come on, now.

1192
01:45:25,014 --> 01:45:26,849
Cal, what are you doing?

1193
01:45:26,932 --> 01:45:29,268
We're in the middle of an emergency.
What's going on?

1194
01:45:29,351 --> 01:45:31,520
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1195
01:45:32,146 --> 01:45:33,814
This is horseshit!

1196
01:45:34,648 --> 01:45:36,484
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't.

1197
01:45:36,567 --> 01:45:38,569
- He couldn't have.
- Of course he could.

1198
01:45:38,652 --> 01:45:40,404
It's easy enough for a professional.

1199
01:45:40,488 --> 01:45:43,199
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1200
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:47,453
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1201
01:45:47,787 --> 01:45:50,039
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1202
01:45:50,122 --> 01:45:53,167
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son?

1203
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:55,336
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1204
01:45:59,089 --> 01:46:00,549
That was reported stolen today.

1205
01:46:00,633 --> 01:46:02,551
I just borrowed it. I was gonna return it.

1206
01:46:02,635 --> 01:46:05,179
An honest thief.
We have an honest thief here, do we?

1207
01:46:05,262 --> 01:46:08,140
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.

1208
01:46:08,265 --> 01:46:10,017
Don't believe them, Rose. You know it.

1209
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:13,062
- You know I didn't do it.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

1210
01:46:13,145 --> 01:46:15,689
- Rose!
- Come on, there's a good lad.

1211
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:17,316
Come on.

1212
01:46:17,399 --> 01:46:19,693
You know I didn't do it. You know me!

1213
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:23,322
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1214
01:46:27,368 --> 01:46:30,621
Water 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes...

1215
01:46:31,288 --> 01:46:34,625
in the forepeak, in all three holds,
and in Boiler Room 6.

1216
01:46:34,667 --> 01:46:37,628
- That's right, sir.
- When can we get underway, damn it?

1217
01:46:37,711 --> 01:46:39,713
That's five compartments.

1218
01:46:41,465 --> 01:46:44,093
She can stay afloat with the first four
compartments breached...

1219
01:46:44,135 --> 01:46:45,636
but not five.

1220
01:46:46,053 --> 01:46:47,388
Not five.

1221
01:46:47,555 --> 01:46:49,098
As she goes down by the head...

1222
01:46:49,181 --> 01:46:52,518
the water will spill over
the tops of the bulkheads at E deck...

1223
01:46:52,852 --> 01:46:55,271
from one to the next, back and back.

1224
01:46:55,438 --> 01:46:57,273
There's no stopping it.

1225
01:46:57,356 --> 01:46:58,774
<i>The pumps. We open the pumps...</i>

1226
01:46:58,858 --> 01:47:01,610
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1227
01:47:02,736 --> 01:47:05,114
From this moment,
no matter what we do...

1228
01:47:05,865 --> 01:47:07,700
<i>Titanic will founder.</i>

1229
01:47:10,411 --> 01:47:11,871
But this ship can't sink.

1230
01:47:11,954 --> 01:47:15,875
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you, she can. And she will.

1231
01:47:17,001 --> 01:47:19,003
It is a mathematical certainty.

1232
01:47:23,591 --> 01:47:25,092
How much time?

1233
01:47:32,558 --> 01:47:34,894
An hour. Two, at most.

1234
01:47:41,150 --> 01:47:43,611
And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1235
01:47:43,778 --> 01:47:46,113
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1236
01:47:53,412 --> 01:47:56,457
Well, I believe you may get your headlines,
Mr. Ismay.

1237
01:48:13,891 --> 01:48:16,227
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?

1238
01:48:17,019 --> 01:48:19,105
You look at me when I'm talking to you!

1239
01:48:19,271 --> 01:48:21,440
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now. We're busy.

1240
01:48:21,524 --> 01:48:24,401
Sir, I've been told to ask you
to put on your lifebelts...

1241
01:48:24,485 --> 01:48:26,487
- and come up to the boat deck.
- I said, not now.

1242
01:48:26,654 --> 01:48:29,698
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.

1243
01:48:29,782 --> 01:48:31,784
Now please, dress warmly.

1244
01:48:32,034 --> 01:48:34,203
It's quite cold out tonight.

1245
01:48:34,662 --> 01:48:37,248
Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats?

1246
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:39,542
This is ridiculous.

1247
01:48:40,209 --> 01:48:43,587
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1248
01:48:44,046 --> 01:48:45,965
Everybody up. Lifebelts on.

1249
01:48:48,008 --> 01:48:49,844
What's he on about?

1250
01:48:49,927 --> 01:48:52,304
- Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on.
- What's the ruckus?

1251
01:48:52,388 --> 01:48:53,764
Just put your lifebelts on.

1252
01:48:55,224 --> 01:48:56,308
CQD?

1253
01:48:56,976 --> 01:48:58,102
Sir?

1254
01:48:59,687 --> 01:49:01,939
That's right, CQD, the distress call.

1255
01:49:02,356 --> 01:49:03,774
That's our position.

1256
01:49:09,238 --> 01:49:11,740
Tell whoever responds
that we're going down by the head...

1257
01:49:11,824 --> 01:49:13,826
and need immediate assistance.

1258
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:23,919
Blimey.

1259
01:49:34,346 --> 01:49:35,723
Keep lowering!

1260
01:49:41,979 --> 01:49:45,733
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1261
01:49:50,946 --> 01:49:54,158
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1262
01:49:54,241 --> 01:49:55,993
Release those ties!

1263
01:49:56,243 --> 01:49:59,121
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1264
01:49:59,622 --> 01:50:01,373
Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers?

1265
01:50:01,457 --> 01:50:04,835
They've all gone back inside.
Too damn cold and noisy for them.

1266
01:50:04,919 --> 01:50:06,086
You there!

1267
01:50:07,004 --> 01:50:09,006
Get down here and help with these lines!

1268
01:50:23,521 --> 01:50:25,439
Care for a drink, sir?

1269
01:50:26,565 --> 01:50:27,858
Please put your lifebelts on.

1270
01:50:27,942 --> 01:50:29,693
Sonny, what's doing?

1271
01:50:30,194 --> 01:50:33,072
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.

1272
01:50:33,114 --> 01:50:35,157
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1273
01:50:36,075 --> 01:50:38,953
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.

1274
01:50:39,036 --> 01:50:41,914
It's just the goddamned English,
doing everything by the book.

1275
01:50:41,997 --> 01:50:44,792
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1276
01:50:45,042 --> 01:50:47,378
Go back and turn the heaters on
in our rooms.

1277
01:50:47,461 --> 01:50:49,380
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1278
01:50:49,463 --> 01:50:51,298
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

1279
01:51:00,933 --> 01:51:02,518
Mr. Andrews...

1280
01:51:03,978 --> 01:51:07,022
I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes.

1281
01:51:07,356 --> 01:51:08,858
Please tell me the truth.

1282
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:19,201
The ship will sink.

1283
01:51:20,911 --> 01:51:22,580
- You're certain?
- Yes.

1284
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:24,582
In an hour or so...

1285
01:51:25,374 --> 01:51:28,586
all this will be
at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1286
01:51:29,253 --> 01:51:30,421
What?

1287
01:51:30,463 --> 01:51:32,506
Please, tell only who you must.

1288
01:51:32,548 --> 01:51:34,842
I don't want to be responsible for a panic.

1289
01:51:35,009 --> 01:51:37,720
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

1290
01:51:38,721 --> 01:51:41,682
You remember
what I told you about the boats?

1291
01:51:44,143 --> 01:51:45,186
Yes.

1292
01:51:47,146 --> 01:51:48,647
I understand.

1293
01:51:52,985 --> 01:51:55,446
Yes, madam, please put it on immediately.

1294
01:51:56,655 --> 01:51:58,199
Over here, son.

1295
01:51:59,074 --> 01:52:01,619
Sir, they need you up
at the second-class purser's office.

1296
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:04,622
- There's a big mob up there.
- Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

1297
01:52:05,247 --> 01:52:06,624
Aye. Right.

1298
01:52:20,513 --> 01:52:21,680
Sir!

1299
01:52:21,764 --> 01:52:24,183
<i>Carpathia says they're making 17 knots.</i>

1300
01:52:24,266 --> 01:52:26,268
Full steam for them, sir.

1301
01:52:27,561 --> 01:52:29,230
She's the only one who's responding?

1302
01:52:29,313 --> 01:52:30,815
The only one close, sir.

1303
01:52:30,856 --> 01:52:33,067
Says they can be here in four hours.

1304
01:52:33,567 --> 01:52:34,985
Four hours!

1305
01:52:40,241 --> 01:52:41,909
Thank you, Bride.

1306
01:52:46,413 --> 01:52:47,665
My God.

1307
01:52:57,299 --> 01:52:59,552
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1308
01:53:00,761 --> 01:53:04,056
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

1309
01:53:06,684 --> 01:53:07,810
Yes.

1310
01:53:07,893 --> 01:53:09,019
Sir?

1311
01:53:11,730 --> 01:53:15,025
Women and children first, yes.

1312
01:53:16,402 --> 01:53:17,736
Yes, sir.

1313
01:53:20,656 --> 01:53:23,784
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

1314
01:53:24,118 --> 01:53:26,495
Step this way, please. That's right.

1315
01:53:26,662 --> 01:53:28,998
Come towards me. Thank you.

1316
01:53:30,583 --> 01:53:31,709
Good.

1317
01:53:31,876 --> 01:53:35,880
For the time being,
I shall require only women and children.

1318
01:53:36,213 --> 01:53:38,299
- Gentlemen, please.
- Right here.

1319
01:53:38,382 --> 01:53:42,136
All right, boys. Like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1320
01:53:43,262 --> 01:53:44,930
<i>Wedding Dance.</i>

1321
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:55,441
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1322
01:53:56,984 --> 01:53:58,652
Here, put your lifebelt on.

1323
01:53:58,736 --> 01:54:00,905
Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on.

1324
01:54:00,988 --> 01:54:02,656
Turn that around.

1325
01:54:03,657 --> 01:54:04,909
Please.

1326
01:54:06,994 --> 01:54:09,497
It isn't time to go up to the boats yet!

1327
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:11,415
Please stay calm.

1328
01:54:11,499 --> 01:54:15,336
Make sure, everybody,
you've got your lifebelts on.

1329
01:54:15,419 --> 01:54:18,214
And, gentlemen, allow the women
and children through to the front.

1330
01:54:18,255 --> 01:54:20,716
- What are we doing, Mommy?
- We're just waiting, dear.

1331
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:23,219
When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats...

1332
01:54:23,302 --> 01:54:26,555
they will be starting with us
and we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

1333
01:54:26,597 --> 01:54:28,098
Everybody, not just right yet.

1334
01:54:28,182 --> 01:54:30,101
Don't push on the gates.
You won't get out any faster.

1335
01:54:30,184 --> 01:54:31,560
- Someone help.
- Go and get some help.

1336
01:54:31,644 --> 01:54:34,271
Lower it away, left and right together!

1337
01:54:36,524 --> 01:54:38,859
Both sides together! Steady!

1338
01:54:39,735 --> 01:54:40,945
Steady!

1339
01:54:44,156 --> 01:54:45,658
Stop!

1340
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:48,452
Hold the left side!

1341
01:54:48,494 --> 01:54:50,871
Right side only!

1342
01:54:51,205 --> 01:54:53,541
Right side only. Hold the left side!

1343
01:54:55,042 --> 01:54:56,794
Lower away together!

1344
01:54:58,587 --> 01:55:00,089
Steady, lads!

1345
01:55:47,678 --> 01:55:50,806
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1346
01:55:53,434 --> 01:55:57,354
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1347
01:56:00,357 --> 01:56:02,818
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1348
01:56:09,742 --> 01:56:12,703
Come on, sister. You heard the man.
Into the boat.

1349
01:56:13,037 --> 01:56:14,872
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1350
01:56:14,955 --> 01:56:17,166
Only women at this time, sir.

1351
01:56:19,668 --> 01:56:22,546
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1352
01:56:24,006 --> 01:56:26,342
I hope they're not too crowded.

1353
01:56:27,468 --> 01:56:29,845
Oh, Mother, shut up!

1354
01:56:30,262 --> 01:56:31,847
Don't you understand?

1355
01:56:31,931 --> 01:56:34,266
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1356
01:56:34,350 --> 01:56:36,102
Not enough by half.

1357
01:56:36,435 --> 01:56:38,771
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1358
01:56:39,105 --> 01:56:40,856
Not the better half.

1359
01:56:42,608 --> 01:56:46,612
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
First-class seats are right up here.

1360
01:56:47,363 --> 01:56:49,490
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.

1361
01:56:49,532 --> 01:56:51,492
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1362
01:56:51,534 --> 01:56:54,703
Women and children
towards the front, please.

1363
01:56:54,745 --> 01:56:57,289
You unimaginable bastard.

1364
01:56:58,249 --> 01:57:00,960
Come on, Rose, darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1365
01:57:01,001 --> 01:57:02,253
Right this way, miss.

1366
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:03,712
Come on, Rose.

1367
01:57:03,796 --> 01:57:05,631
You're next, darling.

1368
01:57:05,798 --> 01:57:07,800
Come into the boat, Rose.

1369
01:57:08,926 --> 01:57:10,052
Come.

1370
01:57:10,594 --> 01:57:11,637
Rose?

1371
01:57:12,763 --> 01:57:14,515
Get into the boat.

1372
01:57:14,849 --> 01:57:15,891
Rose?

1373
01:57:17,435 --> 01:57:19,019
Goodbye, Mother.

1374
01:57:20,729 --> 01:57:21,814
Rose?

1375
01:57:22,314 --> 01:57:24,859
- Rose, come back here.
- Where are you going?

1376
01:57:25,276 --> 01:57:26,485
To him?

1377
01:57:26,652 --> 01:57:28,654
What, to be a whore to a gutter rat?

1378
01:57:28,737 --> 01:57:29,780
No, wait.

1379
01:57:29,864 --> 01:57:32,575
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

1380
01:57:35,703 --> 01:57:36,745
No!

1381
01:57:37,329 --> 01:57:38,747
I said, no!

1382
01:57:40,458 --> 01:57:42,460
Rose, please stop!

1383
01:57:44,295 --> 01:57:45,880
- Lower away!
- No, stop!

1384
01:57:45,963 --> 01:57:47,673
- All together.
- No, wait!

1385
01:57:47,756 --> 01:57:49,175
Lower away!

1386
01:57:49,341 --> 01:57:50,468
Rose!

1387
01:57:56,891 --> 01:57:58,017
Help!

1388
01:57:58,726 --> 01:58:00,811
Can anybody hear me?

1389
01:58:02,021 --> 01:58:03,939
Hello! Help me!

1390
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:15,576
Mr. Andrews!

1391
01:58:18,954 --> 01:58:21,665
- Steward, check the starboard corridor.
- Yes, Mr. Andrews.

1392
01:58:21,749 --> 01:58:24,627
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1393
01:58:24,710 --> 01:58:27,421
Lucy, for God's sake,
put on a lifebelt and set a good example.

1394
01:58:27,463 --> 01:58:28,798
Yes, sir.

1395
01:58:29,215 --> 01:58:31,467
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews?

1396
01:58:31,842 --> 01:58:32,885
Thank God.

1397
01:58:32,968 --> 01:58:35,638
Where would the master-at-arms
take someone under arrest?

1398
01:58:36,013 --> 01:58:38,516
- You have to get to a boat right away.
- No!

1399
01:58:38,599 --> 01:58:40,976
I'm doing this
with or without your help, sir.

1400
01:58:41,018 --> 01:58:43,062
But without will take longer.

1401
01:58:44,438 --> 01:58:47,316
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go to the left.

1402
01:58:47,358 --> 01:58:51,112
Down the crewmen's passage,
then go right and left again at the stairs.

1403
01:58:51,195 --> 01:58:52,696
You'll come to a long corridor.

1404
01:58:57,368 --> 01:58:58,994
This could be bad.

1405
01:59:03,332 --> 01:59:04,583
Oh, shit!

1406
01:59:11,423 --> 01:59:13,259
Excuse me. Thank you.

1407
01:59:14,718 --> 01:59:17,096
- I do not care what you think, sir.
- Lifts are closed.

1408
01:59:17,179 --> 01:59:20,057
I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed.

1409
01:59:20,975 --> 01:59:24,645
I'm through being polite, God damn it!
Now, take me down!

1410
01:59:26,355 --> 01:59:27,523
E deck.

1411
01:59:31,152 --> 01:59:32,361
Come on.

1412
01:59:52,006 --> 01:59:53,674
- I'm going back up.
- No.

1413
01:59:59,388 --> 02:00:02,892
Come back! I'm going back up!

1414
02:00:11,484 --> 02:00:13,027
Crew passage.

1415
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:37,218
Jack!

1416
02:00:50,064 --> 02:00:51,107
Rose!

1417
02:00:52,149 --> 02:00:53,192
Jack!

1418
02:00:53,275 --> 02:00:54,944
Rose, I'm in here!

1419
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,363
Jack!

1420
02:00:58,405 --> 02:00:59,532
- Jack!
- Rose!

1421
02:00:59,615 --> 02:01:02,243
Jack! Jack, I'm sorry.

1422
02:01:02,827 --> 02:01:04,995
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1423
02:01:06,038 --> 02:01:09,708
- That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket.
- I know. I know.

1424
02:01:09,792 --> 02:01:11,001
Listen, Rose...

1425
02:01:11,085 --> 02:01:13,254
you're gonna have to find a spare key,
all right?

1426
02:01:13,337 --> 02:01:15,339
Look in that cabinet right there.

1427
02:01:15,673 --> 02:01:18,050
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1428
02:01:18,968 --> 02:01:20,052
Silver.

1429
02:01:20,636 --> 02:01:22,638
These are all brass ones!

1430
02:01:22,888 --> 02:01:24,807
Check right here, Rose.

1431
02:01:28,894 --> 02:01:30,187
Rose...

1432
02:01:31,397 --> 02:01:33,524
how'd you find out I didn't do it?

1433
02:01:33,691 --> 02:01:36,569
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.

1434
02:01:39,155 --> 02:01:40,614
Keep looking.

1435
02:01:49,498 --> 02:01:52,001
No key. There's no key!

1436
02:01:52,084 --> 02:01:53,252
All right, Rose, listen.

1437
02:01:53,294 --> 02:01:55,421
You're gonna have to go find some help.

1438
02:01:55,921 --> 02:01:57,506
It'll be all right.

1439
02:02:01,844 --> 02:02:03,554
I'll be right back.

1440
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,772
I'll just wait here!

1441
02:02:25,826 --> 02:02:27,995
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1442
02:02:28,412 --> 02:02:29,538
Hello?

1443
02:02:30,414 --> 02:02:32,500
Is there anybody down here?

1444
02:02:33,209 --> 02:02:35,044
We need help! Hello?

1445
02:02:36,837 --> 02:02:38,088
Damn it.

1446
02:02:44,053 --> 02:02:46,597
Can anybody hear me, please? Hello?

1447
02:02:49,975 --> 02:02:51,268
Oh, thank God.

1448
02:02:51,352 --> 02:02:54,647
Wait, I need your help.
There's a man back here.

1449
02:02:55,022 --> 02:02:55,981
Wait!

1450
02:03:00,111 --> 02:03:01,362
Hello?

1451
02:03:27,346 --> 02:03:28,556
Hello?

1452
02:03:29,432 --> 02:03:30,891
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1453
02:03:30,975 --> 02:03:33,519
- I need your help.
- We'll get you topside. This way, quickly.

1454
02:03:33,602 --> 02:03:35,062
There's a man down here. He's trapped.

1455
02:03:35,146 --> 02:03:37,523
- This way. There is no need to panic.
- Please!

1456
02:03:37,565 --> 02:03:40,359
No, I'm not panicking!
You're going the wrong way!

1457
02:03:40,693 --> 02:03:42,445
Let go of me! Listen!

1458
02:03:47,825 --> 02:03:49,493
The hell with you.

1459
02:04:26,864 --> 02:04:28,324
Oh, my God.

1460
02:05:16,622 --> 02:05:17,790
Jack!

1461
02:05:18,290 --> 02:05:19,416
Rose!

1462
02:05:20,543 --> 02:05:22,128
Will this work?

1463
02:05:23,087 --> 02:05:25,422
I guess we'll find out. Come on.

1464
02:05:28,884 --> 02:05:30,010
Wait.

1465
02:05:30,886 --> 02:05:33,013
Try a couple of practice swings over there.

1466
02:05:38,894 --> 02:05:42,815
Good. Now try to hit the same mark again,
Rose. You can do it.

1467
02:05:48,612 --> 02:05:50,448
Okay. That's enough practice.

1468
02:05:50,823 --> 02:05:52,450
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

1469
02:05:53,325 --> 02:05:56,454
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1470
02:05:58,456 --> 02:05:59,832
Come on. Wait.

1471
02:05:59,999 --> 02:06:01,667
Open your hands up a little more.

1472
02:06:01,750 --> 02:06:02,877
- Good.
- Like that?

1473
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:04,211
Right.

1474
02:06:04,462 --> 02:06:06,464
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1475
02:06:11,469 --> 02:06:12,553
Go.

1476
02:06:18,517 --> 02:06:19,769
You did it!

1477
02:06:20,186 --> 02:06:21,729
Come on, let's go.

1478
02:06:21,896 --> 02:06:23,814
Oh, shit, this is cold!

1479
02:06:31,989 --> 02:06:33,824
This is the way out.

1480
02:06:33,991 --> 02:06:36,619
We have to find another way. Come on.

1481
02:06:50,674 --> 02:06:53,302
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

1482
02:07:15,449 --> 02:07:18,828
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. We need the room.

1483
02:07:18,911 --> 02:07:20,579
Get rid of that! Out!

1484
02:07:20,996 --> 02:07:24,125
Come. Time for her to go, sir. Step back.

1485
02:07:24,208 --> 02:07:26,502
- Keep calm. Sit down.
- No.

1486
02:07:26,752 --> 02:07:29,255
- No!
- Make more room.

1487
02:07:30,297 --> 02:07:32,049
That's right. Look sharp.

1488
02:07:33,008 --> 02:07:34,135
Lovejoy.

1489
02:07:34,301 --> 02:07:36,470
She's not on the starboard side, either.

1490
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:37,972
We're running out of time.

1491
02:07:38,013 --> 02:07:41,267
This strutting martinet
isn't letting any men on at all.

1492
02:07:41,517 --> 02:07:44,019
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1493
02:07:44,103 --> 02:07:45,604
Then that's our play.

1494
02:07:45,855 --> 02:07:48,649
We'll need some insurance first. Come on.

1495
02:07:48,732 --> 02:07:51,527
Come on, this way, please.
All the way down there.

1496
02:07:54,029 --> 02:07:55,156
Here!

1497
02:07:55,948 --> 02:07:58,284
What do you think you're doing?

1498
02:07:58,367 --> 02:08:00,536
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1499
02:08:00,619 --> 02:08:03,497
- That's White Star Line property.
- Shut up!

1500
02:08:05,124 --> 02:08:08,794
<i>Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room...</i>

1501
02:08:08,878 --> 02:08:12,006
- Sit down.
- She's the last.

1502
02:08:12,089 --> 02:08:16,010
Mr. Lightoller,
why are the boats being launched half-full?

1503
02:08:16,093 --> 02:08:17,845
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
- There, look.

1504
02:08:17,928 --> 02:08:20,514
Twenty or so in a boat built for 65?

1505
02:08:20,598 --> 02:08:23,142
And I saw one boat with only twelve.
Twelve!

1506
02:08:23,225 --> 02:08:26,020
We weren't sure of the weight,
Mr. Andrews.

1507
02:08:26,061 --> 02:08:28,439
- These boats may buckle.
- Rubbish!

1508
02:08:28,606 --> 02:08:31,317
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1509
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:34,445
Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake, man!

1510
02:08:41,535 --> 02:08:44,497
Please, I need more women and children!

1511
02:08:49,376 --> 02:08:51,796
Get back in there! This is not an exit.

1512
02:08:51,879 --> 02:08:53,547
Get back in there.

1513
02:08:56,133 --> 02:08:59,970
You can't keep us locked in here
like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1514
02:09:00,054 --> 02:09:02,139
Bring forward the women.

1515
02:09:02,223 --> 02:09:04,308
Unlock the gates.

1516
02:09:04,642 --> 02:09:06,393
Women only!

1517
02:09:19,865 --> 02:09:21,450
Lock the gates!

1518
02:09:29,875 --> 02:09:33,003
For God's sake, man, there are
women and children down here!

1519
02:09:33,170 --> 02:09:35,881
Let us up, so we can have a chance!

1520
02:09:36,132 --> 02:09:37,424
Get back!

1521
02:09:40,886 --> 02:09:42,221
- Jack.
- Tommy.

1522
02:09:42,304 --> 02:09:44,223
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way.

1523
02:09:44,265 --> 02:09:46,392
Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast.

1524
02:09:46,559 --> 02:09:47,768
Jack!

1525
02:09:47,852 --> 02:09:49,145
Fabrizio.

1526
02:09:49,603 --> 02:09:50,896
The boats are all gone.

1527
02:09:50,980 --> 02:09:53,065
This whole place is flooding.
We've got to get out.

1528
02:09:53,149 --> 02:09:55,067
<i>- There is niente this way.
- All right.</i>

1529
02:09:55,234 --> 02:09:56,986
Let's go this way, all right? Come on.

1530
02:10:02,783 --> 02:10:05,161
- I make my own luck.
- So do I.

1531
02:10:13,294 --> 02:10:14,545
Come on!

1532
02:10:15,212 --> 02:10:16,797
No, come on, let's go this way.

1533
02:10:26,098 --> 02:10:27,391
This way.

1534
02:10:27,475 --> 02:10:31,812
Just go back to the main stairwell
and everything will be sorted out there.

1535
02:10:31,896 --> 02:10:32,938
The hell it will.

1536
02:10:33,272 --> 02:10:36,692
It will all get sorted out back there.
Go back to the main stairwell.

1537
02:10:36,776 --> 02:10:38,861
- Open the gate.
- Go back down the main stairwell.

1538
02:10:38,944 --> 02:10:39,987
Open the gate right now.

1539
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:42,531
Go back down the main stairwell
like I told you!

1540
02:10:44,742 --> 02:10:47,453
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

1541
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:48,954
Stop that!

1542
02:10:49,121 --> 02:10:50,956
Open the damn gate!

1543
02:10:53,626 --> 02:10:54,835
Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here.

1544
02:10:54,919 --> 02:10:57,213
- Move aside. Move aside!
- Pull!

1545
02:10:58,297 --> 02:10:59,465
Pull!

1546
02:11:00,216 --> 02:11:02,510
- Move aside.
- Put that down!

1547
02:11:02,593 --> 02:11:04,220
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1548
02:11:04,303 --> 02:11:06,514
- One! Two!
- Stop that!

1549
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:07,723
Three!

1550
02:11:09,975 --> 02:11:10,935
Again!

1551
02:11:13,187 --> 02:11:14,480
Let's go!

1552
02:11:16,482 --> 02:11:17,525
Let's go, Rose.

1553
02:11:17,608 --> 02:11:19,944
You can't go up there! You can't do this!

1554
02:11:26,575 --> 02:11:28,285
Keep order here!

1555
02:11:28,369 --> 02:11:30,663
Get back. Get back!

1556
02:11:35,668 --> 02:11:37,253
Hold on to her!

1557
02:11:38,295 --> 02:11:39,421
Pull her in.

1558
02:11:40,131 --> 02:11:42,299
Get back, I say...

1559
02:11:42,550 --> 02:11:45,094
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

1560
02:11:45,136 --> 02:11:46,470
Keep order here!

1561
02:11:48,097 --> 02:11:49,682
Keep order, I say.

1562
02:11:51,308 --> 02:11:53,227
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1563
02:11:57,648 --> 02:11:58,816
Right.

1564
02:11:58,899 --> 02:12:01,777
Is everybody all right? Nobody panic.

1565
02:12:08,075 --> 02:12:09,410
Stay back!

1566
02:12:10,077 --> 02:12:11,328
We're too late.

1567
02:12:11,412 --> 02:12:13,330
There are more boats down the front.

1568
02:12:13,372 --> 02:12:16,625
Stay with this one. Murdoch.
He seems to be quite practical.

1569
02:12:18,586 --> 02:12:20,171
Stop lowering!

1570
02:12:21,297 --> 02:12:22,631
Stop lowering!

1571
02:12:22,965 --> 02:12:24,341
Cut the falls!

1572
02:12:31,307 --> 02:12:32,600
Sit down!

1573
02:12:33,726 --> 02:12:36,270
Stay back, you lot! Just stay back!

1574
02:12:36,437 --> 02:12:38,939
Stay back, the lot of you! Just stay back!

1575
02:12:41,650 --> 02:12:44,236
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1576
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:47,031
Mr. Murdoch?

1577
02:12:47,114 --> 02:12:49,909
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

1578
02:12:50,242 --> 02:12:53,621
I'm a businessman, as you know,
I have a business proposition for you.

1579
02:13:01,253 --> 02:13:02,505
Come on, Rose.

1580
02:13:05,966 --> 02:13:07,802
The boats are gone!

1581
02:13:12,556 --> 02:13:14,225
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?

1582
02:13:14,308 --> 02:13:16,852
No, miss, but there are a couple of boats
all the way forward.

1583
02:13:16,894 --> 02:13:18,562
This way, I'll lead you.

1584
02:13:24,819 --> 02:13:27,613
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1585
02:13:28,114 --> 02:13:32,118
They don't listen to us at dinner, either.
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

1586
02:13:33,494 --> 02:13:34,662
<i>Orpheus.</i>

1587
02:13:39,583 --> 02:13:42,545
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1588
02:13:47,842 --> 02:13:50,886
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1589
02:13:51,137 --> 02:13:52,721
Come on, madam, don't cry.

1590
02:13:53,389 --> 02:13:55,766
We have an understanding, then,
Mr. Murdoch.

1591
02:14:06,861 --> 02:14:10,781
Will the men please hold back?
Hold back, I say!

1592
02:14:13,492 --> 02:14:17,121
Women and children only! Get back!

1593
02:14:17,663 --> 02:14:19,832
I said, step back, sir.
Come through, madam.

1594
02:14:19,915 --> 02:14:21,750
This way. Step back, sir!

1595
02:14:21,834 --> 02:14:22,877
Let the women...

1596
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:25,129
You better check the other side. Go!

1597
02:14:32,928 --> 02:14:36,599
I found her, on the other side.
Waiting for a boat...

1598
02:14:37,266 --> 02:14:38,434
with him.

1599
02:14:39,643 --> 02:14:42,438
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1600
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:44,064
Anyone else then?

1601
02:14:45,107 --> 02:14:46,525
- Hop on, sir.
- Anyone else?

1602
02:14:46,567 --> 02:14:48,486
Do hurry. Hurry along.

1603
02:14:51,864 --> 02:14:53,282
Stand by the falls.

1604
02:14:53,365 --> 02:14:55,201
God damn it all to hell.

1605
02:14:57,787 --> 02:14:58,829
Shit.

1606
02:14:58,996 --> 02:14:59,955
Fire!

1607
02:15:01,165 --> 02:15:03,459
Sir, you can't go through here.

1608
02:15:03,876 --> 02:15:05,711
Sir, you can't go through.

1609
02:15:07,505 --> 02:15:09,632
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1610
02:15:13,969 --> 02:15:15,346
Prepare to lower!

1611
02:15:17,681 --> 02:15:19,350
Ready on the left!

1612
02:15:25,439 --> 02:15:26,816
Take them down.

1613
02:15:31,862 --> 02:15:33,239
Keep it steady.

1614
02:15:35,783 --> 02:15:39,245
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1615
02:15:40,788 --> 02:15:42,998
- Give her to me.
- Daddy.

1616
02:15:43,249 --> 02:15:45,960
- It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.
- Take her.

1617
02:15:46,001 --> 02:15:47,753
Daddy, get in the boat.

1618
02:15:47,837 --> 02:15:51,340
It's goodbye for a little while.
Only for a little while.

1619
02:15:51,423 --> 02:15:53,134
There'll be another boat for the daddies...

1620
02:15:53,217 --> 02:15:54,969
this boat's for the mommies
and the children.

1621
02:15:55,052 --> 02:15:57,930
You hold Mommy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1622
02:15:58,597 --> 02:15:59,849
I'm not going without you.

1623
02:16:00,015 --> 02:16:02,351
- No. You have to go, now.
- No, Jack.

1624
02:16:02,685 --> 02:16:04,353
Get in the boat, Rose.

1625
02:16:04,437 --> 02:16:05,479
No, Jack.

1626
02:16:05,563 --> 02:16:07,314
Yes. Get on the boat.

1627
02:16:07,565 --> 02:16:09,483
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1628
02:16:12,695 --> 02:16:15,489
My God. Look at you. You look a fright.

1629
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:17,116
Here.

1630
02:16:18,784 --> 02:16:20,870
Put this on. Come on.

1631
02:16:26,417 --> 02:16:28,335
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1632
02:16:28,419 --> 02:16:30,421
No, not without you.

1633
02:16:30,504 --> 02:16:32,506
I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine.

1634
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:34,675
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1635
02:16:34,759 --> 02:16:36,093
Now, go on. Get on.

1636
02:16:36,135 --> 02:16:38,846
I have an arrangement with an officer
on the other side of the ship.

1637
02:16:38,929 --> 02:16:41,474
Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.

1638
02:16:42,933 --> 02:16:45,269
See? I got my own boat to catch.

1639
02:16:45,770 --> 02:16:48,397
- Go.
- Come on, hurry. They're almost full.

1640
02:16:49,774 --> 02:16:50,816
Step aboard, miss.

1641
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:52,318
- Go.
- Come on, hurry.

1642
02:16:53,152 --> 02:16:55,279
- Step aboard, please.
- You're Daddy's good girl.

1643
02:16:55,321 --> 02:16:57,615
- Step lively!
- Keep back.

1644
02:16:57,782 --> 02:16:59,450
Keep back, I say.

1645
02:17:01,327 --> 02:17:03,078
Clear the rail, please.

1646
02:17:04,121 --> 02:17:05,414
Lower away!

1647
02:17:09,168 --> 02:17:10,461
Steady.

1648
02:17:13,422 --> 02:17:15,508
And lower away evenly, lads.

1649
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:17,343
Easy.

1650
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:19,053
Lower away.

1651
02:17:19,136 --> 02:17:20,971
You're a good liar.

1652
02:17:21,138 --> 02:17:22,473
Almost as good as you.

1653
02:17:22,556 --> 02:17:25,309
Easy, now. And lower away.

1654
02:17:27,645 --> 02:17:30,898
<i>There's no... There's no arrangement,
is there?</i>

1655
02:17:32,608 --> 02:17:34,193
No, there is.

1656
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:36,612
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1657
02:17:36,695 --> 02:17:37,947
And even away.

1658
02:17:38,364 --> 02:17:39,406
I always win, Jack.

1659
02:17:39,490 --> 02:17:41,408
And lower away evenly, lads.

1660
02:17:41,492 --> 02:17:42,618
One way or another.

1661
02:17:42,701 --> 02:17:45,496
Watch that trim. Trim that boat.

1662
02:17:46,622 --> 02:17:47,665
Easy.

1663
02:17:48,624 --> 02:17:50,000
Even, lads.

1664
02:17:50,584 --> 02:17:52,002
Keep going!

1665
02:17:52,086 --> 02:17:53,295
Keep going!

1666
02:18:40,926 --> 02:18:42,052
Rose!

1667
02:18:44,305 --> 02:18:45,806
- Stop her!
- Rose!

1668
02:18:46,140 --> 02:18:48,058
- What are you doing?
- Stop her!

1669
02:18:49,101 --> 02:18:50,227
No!

1670
02:19:08,454 --> 02:19:09,580
Rose!

1671
02:19:13,083 --> 02:19:15,836
You're so stupid! Why did you do that?

1672
02:19:16,295 --> 02:19:18,047
You're so stupid, Rose.

1673
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:21,759
Why did you do that? Why?

1674
02:19:22,343 --> 02:19:24,386
You jump, I jump, right?

1675
02:19:26,514 --> 02:19:27,598
Right.

1676
02:19:29,767 --> 02:19:30,893
Oh, God.

1677
02:19:30,976 --> 02:19:33,479
I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack.

1678
02:19:34,105 --> 02:19:36,524
It's all right. We'll think of something.

1679
02:19:37,483 --> 02:19:39,568
At least I'm with you.

1680
02:19:53,207 --> 02:19:54,625
Come on! Move!

1681
02:19:55,626 --> 02:19:56,961
Come on!

1682
02:19:57,795 --> 02:19:59,463
Come on! Move!

1683
02:20:05,803 --> 02:20:07,054
Come on!

1684
02:20:14,854 --> 02:20:15,896
Move!

1685
02:20:22,069 --> 02:20:23,529
Come on, come on, Rose!

1686
02:20:25,948 --> 02:20:27,450
Rose, come on!

1687
02:20:30,244 --> 02:20:31,370
Move, Rose!

1688
02:20:34,498 --> 02:20:35,541
Go!

1689
02:20:45,885 --> 02:20:48,137
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1690
02:21:02,651 --> 02:21:04,570
What could possibly be funny?

1691
02:21:05,488 --> 02:21:07,698
I put the diamond in the coat.

1692
02:21:10,701 --> 02:21:12,828
And I put the coat on her!

1693
02:21:14,371 --> 02:21:15,581
Come on.

1694
02:21:34,683 --> 02:21:36,435
Dada!

1695
02:21:39,647 --> 02:21:41,148
We can't leave him.

1696
02:21:45,319 --> 02:21:46,779
All right, come on!

1697
02:21:48,531 --> 02:21:50,449
Dada!

1698
02:22:03,295 --> 02:22:04,422
Go back!

1699
02:22:15,349 --> 02:22:17,726
That's the wrong way! Come back!

1700
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:25,443
Go!

1701
02:22:27,862 --> 02:22:28,946
Go!

1702
02:22:29,864 --> 02:22:31,282
Run, Rose!

1703
02:22:38,747 --> 02:22:39,790
Jack!

1704
02:22:43,085 --> 02:22:44,587
- Jack!
- Rose!

1705
02:22:57,433 --> 02:22:58,476
This way!

1706
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:08,903
Come on!

1707
02:23:10,279 --> 02:23:11,697
Give me your hand!

1708
02:23:20,456 --> 02:23:21,832
Oh, God!

1709
02:23:26,670 --> 02:23:27,713
Help!

1710
02:23:33,427 --> 02:23:34,678
Help!

1711
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:39,100
Wait, sir! Sir, open the gate, please!

1712
02:23:39,183 --> 02:23:41,644
- Please!
- Please, help us!

1713
02:23:41,894 --> 02:23:43,437
- Please!
- Please!

1714
02:23:44,730 --> 02:23:45,981
Bloody hell!

1715
02:23:49,360 --> 02:23:50,402
Hurry.

1716
02:23:51,779 --> 02:23:53,614
- Come on, come on!
- Come on!

1717
02:23:54,198 --> 02:23:55,449
Go, go!

1718
02:23:55,533 --> 02:23:56,575
Jesus.

1719
02:23:57,409 --> 02:23:58,828
- Please!
- Come on!

1720
02:23:59,161 --> 02:24:00,204
Hurry!

1721
02:24:00,538 --> 02:24:01,705
Come on!

1722
02:24:07,002 --> 02:24:08,754
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1723
02:24:09,505 --> 02:24:10,840
- Wait, please!
- Wait!

1724
02:24:12,133 --> 02:24:15,094
Don't leave! Please, send for help!

1725
02:24:33,487 --> 02:24:35,656
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

1726
02:24:35,990 --> 02:24:37,950
The short one. Try the short one.

1727
02:24:38,951 --> 02:24:40,286
Hurry, Jack.

1728
02:24:43,497 --> 02:24:45,583
Oh, no! No, it won't go in.

1729
02:24:45,833 --> 02:24:47,126
Hurry, Jack.

1730
02:24:49,754 --> 02:24:51,839
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1731
02:24:52,673 --> 02:24:54,633
- Come on!
- Hurry, Jack!

1732
02:24:56,010 --> 02:24:57,553
Hurry, Jack!

1733
02:25:00,347 --> 02:25:02,683
I got it! Go, Rose!

1734
02:25:03,642 --> 02:25:05,144
Go!

1735
02:25:15,196 --> 02:25:16,530
Jack!

1736
02:25:18,574 --> 02:25:20,075
Come on!

1737
02:25:21,368 --> 02:25:22,787
Move, move.

1738
02:25:32,838 --> 02:25:35,966
- Get those oars in place.
- Get an oar under it.

1739
02:25:36,759 --> 02:25:39,011
Women and children only, damn you!

1740
02:25:39,887 --> 02:25:42,598
Hold it!

1741
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:57,279
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1742
02:26:06,789 --> 02:26:08,082
Stay back!

1743
02:26:09,917 --> 02:26:11,293
Mommy!

1744
02:26:11,919 --> 02:26:13,546
Stay back, sir!

1745
02:26:15,047 --> 02:26:16,799
Stay back, I say.

1746
02:26:18,259 --> 02:26:19,718
Keep going up!

1747
02:26:22,596 --> 02:26:24,265
Stop pushing!

1748
02:26:25,266 --> 02:26:27,393
Stay back!

1749
02:26:27,476 --> 02:26:30,229
Will you give us a chance to live,
you limey bastard?

1750
02:26:30,312 --> 02:26:33,107
I'll shoot any man
who tries to get past me! Get back!

1751
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:34,316
Bastard!

1752
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:35,734
Get back!

1753
02:26:36,402 --> 02:26:38,404
We had a deal, damn it!

1754
02:26:40,823 --> 02:26:44,952
Your money can't save you anymore
than it can save me. Get back!

1755
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:47,955
Women and children only!

1756
02:26:50,416 --> 02:26:51,792
Stop pushing!

1757
02:26:53,961 --> 02:26:55,254
No, Tommy!

1758
02:26:55,880 --> 02:26:57,715
No! No, Tommy!

1759
02:26:58,382 --> 02:26:59,717
<i>Bastardo!</i>

1760
02:27:17,318 --> 02:27:18,569
No, Will!

1761
02:27:25,326 --> 02:27:26,368
Now stand back, damn you!

1762
02:27:30,372 --> 02:27:32,708
Gently, hold it.

1763
02:27:43,219 --> 02:27:44,887
I have a child!

1764
02:27:46,013 --> 02:27:47,681
Clear a path!

1765
02:27:47,765 --> 02:27:49,767
Please, I have a child.

1766
02:27:50,518 --> 02:27:53,062
Please, I'm all she has in the world.

1767
02:27:53,896 --> 02:27:55,064
Go on.

1768
02:27:55,397 --> 02:27:56,899
Step back!

1769
02:27:56,941 --> 02:27:58,025
Please!

1770
02:27:58,067 --> 02:28:00,194
Here. Give her to me.

1771
02:28:06,158 --> 02:28:07,910
There, there.

1772
02:28:11,914 --> 02:28:14,333
Wait! Mr. Andrews.

1773
02:28:16,961 --> 02:28:18,254
Oh, Rose.

1774
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:23,259
Won't you even make a try for it?

1775
02:28:24,468 --> 02:28:28,431
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1776
02:28:31,058 --> 02:28:33,144
It's going fast. We have to move.

1777
02:28:33,227 --> 02:28:34,311
Wait.

1778
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:39,358
Good luck to you, Rose.

1779
02:28:40,943 --> 02:28:42,236
And to you.

1780
02:28:54,582 --> 02:28:57,460
Mr. Guggenheim? These are for you.

1781
02:28:57,501 --> 02:29:00,129
No, thank you.
We are dressed in our best...

1782
02:29:00,254 --> 02:29:02,923
and are prepared to go down
as gentlemen.

1783
02:29:03,674 --> 02:29:05,426
But we would like a brandy.

1784
02:29:06,218 --> 02:29:08,137
Get the falls over here!

1785
02:29:08,888 --> 02:29:11,432
Make them taut. Then we'll right it!

1786
02:29:18,022 --> 02:29:21,150
<i>Capit?n, where should I go? Please.</i>

1787
02:29:27,239 --> 02:29:29,867
Captain. Sir.

1788
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:02,858
Right. That's it, then.

1789
02:30:03,901 --> 02:30:06,070
Goodbye, Wally, good luck.

1790
02:30:06,445 --> 02:30:09,031
- Goodbye, Wallace.
- So long, old chap.

1791
02:31:23,314 --> 02:31:27,067
And so they lived happily together
for 300 years...

1792
02:31:28,194 --> 02:31:30,780
in the land of Tir na nOg...

1793
02:31:31,030 --> 02:31:33,491
land of eternal youth and beauty.

1794
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:12,238
There's no time! Cut the falls!

1795
02:32:12,321 --> 02:32:14,740
Cut them if you have to!

1796
02:32:15,366 --> 02:32:17,701
I need a knife!

1797
02:32:19,328 --> 02:32:22,832
Cut the falls now! Cut them loose!

1798
02:32:34,135 --> 02:32:35,970
Cut those bloody falls!

1799
02:33:23,392 --> 02:33:27,229
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1800
02:34:28,332 --> 02:34:30,418
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible.

1801
02:34:30,501 --> 02:34:31,710
Come on.

1802
02:34:43,597 --> 02:34:45,641
This way. Hold the rail.

1803
02:34:47,518 --> 02:34:49,812
Come on, Rose. Jump.

1804
02:34:52,398 --> 02:34:53,524
Come on.

1805
02:35:26,974 --> 02:35:28,684
I got you. Jump!

1806
02:35:31,228 --> 02:35:33,022
I've got you, miss.

1807
02:35:33,481 --> 02:35:34,982
- Jack!
- What?

1808
02:35:36,776 --> 02:35:37,943
Back!

1809
02:36:08,057 --> 02:36:09,809
No, you'll swamp us!

1810
02:36:18,150 --> 02:36:19,485
Nobody panic.

1811
02:36:22,780 --> 02:36:26,033
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

1812
02:36:26,117 --> 02:36:28,869
You want to walk a little faster
through that valley, there?

1813
02:37:18,794 --> 02:37:21,422
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us, sinners...

1814
02:37:21,505 --> 02:37:23,924
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1815
02:37:24,008 --> 02:37:25,509
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace...</i>

1816
02:37:25,593 --> 02:37:26,844
This way.

1817
02:37:37,813 --> 02:37:39,315
Come on!

1818
02:37:48,657 --> 02:37:50,951
And I saw a new heaven and a new Earth.

1819
02:37:51,035 --> 02:37:54,538
For the first heaven
and the first Earth had passed away...

1820
02:37:55,831 --> 02:37:57,917
and there was no more sea.

1821
02:38:03,798 --> 02:38:07,009
It'll be over soon. It'll all be over soon.

1822
02:38:12,848 --> 02:38:14,517
And he shall dwell with them...

1823
02:38:14,642 --> 02:38:16,435
and they shall be his people...

1824
02:38:16,519 --> 02:38:20,106
and God himself shall be with them
and be their God.

1825
02:38:21,232 --> 02:38:22,441
Jack...

1826
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:24,860
this is where we first met.

1827
02:38:32,243 --> 02:38:35,704
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes...

1828
02:38:35,788 --> 02:38:38,165
and there shall be no more death...

1829
02:38:38,707 --> 02:38:41,377
neither shall there be sorrow or crying...

1830
02:38:41,419 --> 02:38:44,046
neither shall there be any more pain...

1831
02:38:44,380 --> 02:38:47,007
for the former world has passed away.

1832
02:39:01,856 --> 02:39:04,108
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1833
02:39:27,506 --> 02:39:28,966
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

1834
02:40:04,668 --> 02:40:06,337
Hold on real tight.

1835
02:40:23,979 --> 02:40:25,356
God almighty!

1836
02:40:33,239 --> 02:40:35,658
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!

1837
02:41:54,820 --> 02:41:56,489
We have to move!

1838
02:42:01,911 --> 02:42:03,871
Give me your hand, I'll pull you over.

1839
02:42:04,205 --> 02:42:06,248
Come on, give me your hand.

1840
02:42:08,542 --> 02:42:10,795
I've got you. I won't let go.

1841
02:42:10,836 --> 02:42:11,921
Come on, I've got you.

1842
02:42:23,516 --> 02:42:26,060
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know.

1843
02:42:35,653 --> 02:42:37,238
- Hold on!
- Jack!

1844
02:42:40,366 --> 02:42:42,618
Somebody help me, please!

1845
02:43:19,155 --> 02:43:20,531
This is it!

1846
02:43:32,585 --> 02:43:34,920
Oh, my God, Jack!

1847
02:43:36,046 --> 02:43:37,381
Hold on!

1848
02:43:52,480 --> 02:43:54,815
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1849
02:43:55,065 --> 02:43:56,734
Take a deep breath when I say.

1850
02:44:02,364 --> 02:44:04,867
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

1851
02:44:04,992 --> 02:44:06,494
Do not let go of my hand.

1852
02:44:13,751 --> 02:44:16,378
We're going to make it, Rose. Trust me.

1853
02:44:16,462 --> 02:44:17,797
I trust you.

1854
02:44:22,551 --> 02:44:25,846
Ready? Now!

1855
02:45:02,591 --> 02:45:04,468
Jack!

1856
02:45:08,431 --> 02:45:09,807
- Rose!
- Jack!

1857
02:45:14,437 --> 02:45:15,438
Jack!

1858
02:45:36,083 --> 02:45:37,793
Jack!

1859
02:45:48,846 --> 02:45:50,389
Get off her!

1860
02:45:54,143 --> 02:45:55,352
- Rose!
- Jack!

1861
02:45:55,728 --> 02:45:58,063
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1862
02:46:01,901 --> 02:46:03,486
Keep swimming.

1863
02:46:07,281 --> 02:46:09,658
- It's so cold.
- Swim, Rose!

1864
02:46:15,122 --> 02:46:16,957
Come on. Here.

1865
02:46:18,334 --> 02:46:20,586
Keep swimming. Come on.

1866
02:46:22,963 --> 02:46:24,590
Here, get on it.

1867
02:46:25,966 --> 02:46:27,426
Get on top.

1868
02:46:34,934 --> 02:46:36,435
Come on, Rose.

1869
02:46:45,778 --> 02:46:47,822
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1870
02:47:09,260 --> 02:47:11,178
It'll be all right now.

1871
02:47:13,347 --> 02:47:15,141
You'll be all right now.

1872
02:47:22,356 --> 02:47:25,359
Return the boats!

1873
02:47:29,321 --> 02:47:31,866
The boats are coming back for us, Rose.

1874
02:47:32,199 --> 02:47:34,368
Hold on just a little bit longer.

1875
02:47:34,452 --> 02:47:37,163
They had to row away for the suction...

1876
02:47:38,372 --> 02:47:40,708
but now they'll be coming back.

1877
02:47:42,376 --> 02:47:43,753
For God's sake!

1878
02:47:43,836 --> 02:47:46,964
Please help us!

1879
02:47:52,261 --> 02:47:54,096
You don't understand.

1880
02:47:54,805 --> 02:47:59,059
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.
They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you.

1881
02:47:59,143 --> 02:48:01,645
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

1882
02:48:01,896 --> 02:48:04,690
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.

1883
02:48:04,774 --> 02:48:08,194
Are you out of your mind?
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

1884
02:48:08,235 --> 02:48:11,655
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?

1885
02:48:18,329 --> 02:48:20,706
I don't understand a one of you.

1886
02:48:22,458 --> 02:48:25,753
What's the matter with you?
It's your men out there!

1887
02:48:28,589 --> 02:48:30,257
There's plenty of room for more.

1888
02:48:30,341 --> 02:48:32,301
And there'll be one less on this boat.

1889
02:48:32,343 --> 02:48:35,221
If you don't shut that hole in your face!

1890
02:48:51,362 --> 02:48:53,364
Bring in your oars over there.

1891
02:48:53,447 --> 02:48:56,117
Tie these two boats together as well.

1892
02:48:59,870 --> 02:49:02,748
Now, make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

1893
02:49:06,043 --> 02:49:08,587
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1894
02:49:08,629 --> 02:49:12,341
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now.

1895
02:49:12,425 --> 02:49:13,801
As quick as you can, please.

1896
02:49:13,843 --> 02:49:16,470
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and out.

1897
02:49:26,188 --> 02:49:27,940
It's getting quiet.

1898
02:49:30,276 --> 02:49:35,239
It's just going to take a couple of minutes
to get the boats organized.

1899
02:49:38,868 --> 02:49:40,745
I don't know about you...

1900
02:49:40,828 --> 02:49:44,790
but I intend to write
a strongly-worded letter...

1901
02:49:44,874 --> 02:49:47,418
to the White Star Line about all this.

1902
02:49:54,592 --> 02:49:56,260
I love you, Jack.

1903
02:50:02,933 --> 02:50:04,602
Don't you do that.

1904
02:50:05,895 --> 02:50:08,189
Don't you say your goodbyes.

1905
02:50:08,606 --> 02:50:10,858
Not yet. Do you understand me?

1906
02:50:11,484 --> 02:50:12,860
I'm so cold.

1907
02:50:13,819 --> 02:50:15,321
Listen, Rose...

1908
02:50:16,405 --> 02:50:18,324
you're gonna get out of here.

1909
02:50:19,116 --> 02:50:20,951
You're gonna go on...

1910
02:50:21,452 --> 02:50:24,163
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

1911
02:50:24,580 --> 02:50:26,874
And you're gonna watch them grow.

1912
02:50:28,167 --> 02:50:32,254
You're gonna die an old lady,
warm in her bed.

1913
02:50:34,507 --> 02:50:35,800
Not here.

1914
02:50:36,425 --> 02:50:37,885
Not this night.

1915
02:50:38,302 --> 02:50:40,846
Not like this. Do you understand me?

1916
02:50:43,808 --> 02:50:45,643
I can't feel my body.

1917
02:50:47,770 --> 02:50:51,816
Winning that ticket was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1918
02:50:53,692 --> 02:50:55,444
It brought me to you.

1919
02:50:57,154 --> 02:50:59,532
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

1920
02:51:00,199 --> 02:51:01,700
I'm thankful.

1921
02:51:03,786 --> 02:51:06,288
You must...

1922
02:51:07,456 --> 02:51:09,083
do me this honor.

1923
02:51:12,211 --> 02:51:15,172
You must promise me that you'll survive.

1924
02:51:16,632 --> 02:51:19,093
That you won't give up...

1925
02:51:20,386 --> 02:51:22,388
no matter what happens.

1926
02:51:24,932 --> 02:51:26,976
No matter how hopeless.

1927
02:51:30,729 --> 02:51:32,523
Promise me now, Rose.

1928
02:51:35,067 --> 02:51:37,403
And never let go of that promise.

1929
02:51:38,779 --> 02:51:40,197
I promise.

1930
02:51:42,491 --> 02:51:44,034
Never let go.

1931
02:51:46,871 --> 02:51:48,873
I'll never let go, Jack.

1932
02:51:51,834 --> 02:51:53,502
I'll never let go.

1933
02:52:17,651 --> 02:52:19,278
Right ahead, sir.

1934
02:52:22,323 --> 02:52:23,449
Oars!

1935
02:52:24,241 --> 02:52:26,077
Do you see any moving?

1936
02:52:26,994 --> 02:52:29,038
No, sir. None moving, sir.

1937
02:52:29,538 --> 02:52:30,956
Check them.

1938
02:52:31,248 --> 02:52:33,125
Bring that oar up here.

1939
02:52:39,173 --> 02:52:41,092
Check them. Make sure.

1940
02:52:41,550 --> 02:52:43,302
These are dead, sir.

1941
02:52:43,803 --> 02:52:46,222
Now give way. Ahead easy.

1942
02:52:53,187 --> 02:52:55,981
Careful with your oars. Don't hit them.

1943
02:52:58,901 --> 02:53:01,278
Is there anyone alive out there?

1944
02:53:02,822 --> 02:53:04,824
Can anyone hear me?

1945
02:53:06,826 --> 02:53:09,120
Is there anyone alive out there?

1946
02:53:16,127 --> 02:53:17,670
We waited too long.

1947
02:53:21,674 --> 02:53:24,135
Keep checking them! Keep looking!

1948
02:53:25,553 --> 02:53:27,847
Is there anyone alive out there?

1949
02:53:31,475 --> 02:53:33,185
Can anyone hear me?

1950
02:53:48,617 --> 02:53:51,996
<i>In my flying machine</i>

1951
02:53:53,789 --> 02:53:56,625
<i>And up she goes</i>

1952
02:53:58,961 --> 02:54:00,629
<i>Up she goes</i>

1953
02:54:06,093 --> 02:54:08,596
<i>Come, Josephine</i>

1954
02:54:11,307 --> 02:54:14,852
<i>In my flying machine</i>

1955
02:54:37,374 --> 02:54:38,417
Jack?

1956
02:54:58,229 --> 02:54:59,772
There's a boat.

1957
02:55:00,314 --> 02:55:01,357
Jack?

1958
02:55:26,632 --> 02:55:28,426
There's a boat, Jack.

1959
02:56:12,678 --> 02:56:14,013
Come back.

1960
02:56:23,814 --> 02:56:25,149
Come back!

1961
02:56:29,987 --> 02:56:31,739
Hello!

1962
02:56:33,199 --> 02:56:35,076
Can anyone hear me?

1963
02:56:36,035 --> 02:56:38,079
There's nothing here, sir.

1964
02:56:39,955 --> 02:56:41,290
Come back.

1965
02:56:51,967 --> 02:56:54,845
I'll never let go. I promise.

1966
02:57:38,639 --> 02:57:40,057
Come about!

1967
02:58:01,579 --> 02:58:04,915
Fifteen hundred people went into the sea...

1968
02:58:05,416 --> 02:58:08,377
<i>when Titanic sank from under us.</i>

1969
02:58:10,546 --> 02:58:13,424
There were 20 boats floating nearby...

1970
02:58:14,800 --> 02:58:16,719
and only one came back.

1971
02:58:18,971 --> 02:58:20,014
One.

1972
02:58:21,849 --> 02:58:24,351
Six were saved from the water...

1973
02:58:24,810 --> 02:58:26,353
myself included.

1974
02:58:27,813 --> 02:58:32,276
Six out of 1,500.

1975
02:58:35,571 --> 02:58:39,909
Afterward, the 700 people in the boats...

1976
02:58:40,242 --> 02:58:42,703
had nothing to do but wait.

1977
02:58:44,497 --> 02:58:47,708
Wait to die, wait to live.

1978
02:58:49,210 --> 02:58:51,378
Wait for an absolution...

1979
02:58:51,921 --> 02:58:53,923
that would never come.

1980
02:59:58,237 --> 03:00:00,698
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

1981
03:00:00,740 --> 03:00:02,408
It's all steerage.

1982
03:00:07,455 --> 03:00:10,458
His hair is reddish brown,
and a white beard.

1983
03:00:10,541 --> 03:00:13,461
- Isn't there another passenger list?
- There's no other list.

1984
03:00:13,544 --> 03:00:17,006
- Perhaps he's on another ship.
- We're doing all we can.

1985
03:00:40,654 --> 03:00:43,324
<i>That's the last time I ever saw him.</i>

1986
03:00:43,491 --> 03:00:46,744
<i>He married, of course,
and inherited his millions.</i>

1987
03:00:47,953 --> 03:00:51,165
<i>But the crash of '29 hit his interests hard.</i>

1988
03:00:51,582 --> 03:00:54,293
<i>And he put a pistol in his mouth that year.</i>

1989
03:00:54,627 --> 03:00:56,087
Or so I read.

1990
03:01:09,183 --> 03:01:11,352
Can I take your name, please, love?

1991
03:01:13,729 --> 03:01:14,980
Dawson.

1992
03:01:17,233 --> 03:01:18,692
Rose Dawson.

1993
03:01:19,819 --> 03:01:21,153
Thank you.

1994
03:01:28,077 --> 03:01:32,081
We never found anything on Jack.
There's no record of him at all.

1995
03:01:33,082 --> 03:01:35,042
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

1996
03:01:35,709 --> 03:01:40,423
And I've never spoken of him until now.
Not to anyone.

1997
03:01:41,298 --> 03:01:43,384
Not even your grandfather.

1998
03:01:43,717 --> 03:01:47,179
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

1999
03:01:48,514 --> 03:01:51,892
But now you know
there was a man named Jack Dawson...

2000
03:01:52,393 --> 03:01:54,353
and that he saved me...

2001
03:01:54,812 --> 03:01:57,731
in every way that a person can be saved.

2002
03:01:59,984 --> 03:02:02,486
I don't even have a picture of him.

2003
03:02:05,197 --> 03:02:09,034
He exists now only in my memory.

2004
03:02:14,331 --> 03:02:17,126
<i>Keldysh, Mir-2 on our way to the surface.</i>

2005
03:02:34,310 --> 03:02:37,396
I was saving this
for when I found the diamond.

2006
03:02:46,489 --> 03:02:47,823
I'm sorry.

2007
03:02:50,576 --> 03:02:51,994
Three years.

2008
03:02:52,620 --> 03:02:55,372
<i>I've thought of nothing except Titanic.</i>

2009
03:02:56,040 --> 03:02:57,792
But I never got it.

2010
03:03:00,920 --> 03:03:02,588
I never let it in.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
