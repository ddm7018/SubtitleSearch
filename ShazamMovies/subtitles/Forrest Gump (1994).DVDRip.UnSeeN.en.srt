1
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,769
Hello.
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

2
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:30,610
Do you want a chocolate?

3
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:37,576
I could eat
about a million and a half of these.

4
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:42,581
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

5
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,503
You never know
what you're going to get.

6
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:57,929
Those must be comfortable shoes.

7
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:03,018
I bet you could walk all day in shoes
like that and not feel a thing.

8
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:10,108
- I wish I had shoes like that.
- My feet hurt.

9
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,112
Mama always said there's an awful lot

10
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:17,491
you can tell about a person
by their shoes.

11
00:04:17,616 --> 00:04:20,994
Where they're going,
where they've been.

12
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:30,712
I've worn lots of shoes.

13
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:35,050
I bet if I think about it real hard,

14
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,804
I could remember
my first pair of shoes.

15
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,725
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

16
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,895
She said they was my magic shoes.

17
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,524
All right, Forrest,
open your eyes now.

18
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:59,574
Let's take a little walk around.

19
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:08,583
How do those feel?

20
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:16,174
His legs are strong, Mrs Gump,
as strong as I've ever seen.

21
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:20,345
But his back's as
crooked as a politician.

22
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,016
But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?

23
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:30,814
When I was a baby, Mama named me
after the great Civil War hero

24
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,650
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

25
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:36,153
She said we was related to him
in some way.

26
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:41,450
What he did was he started up
this club called the Ku Klux Klan.

27
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,870
They'd all dress up
in their robes and their bed sheets

28
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:49,499
and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.

29
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:53,462
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

30
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:57,716
And anyway, that's how
I got my name, Forrest Gump.

31
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:01,678
Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me that sometimes

32
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:06,308
we all do things that, well,
just don't make no sense.

33
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:18,278
This way. Hold on.

34
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:22,240
All right.
What are y'all staring at?

35
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:26,787
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

36
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,958
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

37
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:34,503
If God wanted everybody
to be the same,

38
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,339
he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.

39
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,842
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

40
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:46,181
We lived about
a quarter mile off Route 17,

41
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,184
about a half mile
from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

42
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,187
That's in the county of Greenbow.

43
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:56,733
Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

44
00:06:56,858 --> 00:07:00,028
had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.

45
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:04,741
Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,

46
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:09,162
Mama decided to let those rooms out,
mostly to people passing through,

47
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:12,582
Iike from Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

48
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:18,046
That's how me and Mama got money.
Mama was a real smart lady.

49
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:20,340
Remember what I told you, Forrest.

50
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:23,760
You're no different
than anybody else is.

51
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:30,559
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
You're the same as everybody else.

52
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,061
You are no different.

53
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:39,693
Your boy's different, Mrs Gump.
His l.Q. Is 75.

54
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:43,697
Well, we're all different,
Mr Hancock.

55
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,911
She wanted me to have
the finest education,

56
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:53,582
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

57
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,834
I met the principal and all.

58
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,254
I want to show you
something, Mrs Gump.

59
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:06,053
Now, this is normal.
Forrest is right here.

60
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:11,516
The state requires a minimum l.Q.
of 80 to attend public school.

61
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:15,854
Mrs Gump, he's going to have
to go to a special school.

62
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:20,734
- He'll be just fine.
- What does normal mean anyway?

63
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:26,073
He might be a bit on the slow side,
but my boy Forrest

64
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:29,368
will get the same opportunities
as everyone else.

65
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:33,747
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to retread tyres.

66
00:08:33,872 --> 00:08:37,334
We're talking about
five little points here.

67
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,546
There must be something can be done.

68
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,842
We're a progressive school system.

69
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:49,388
We don't want to see
anybody left behind.

70
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:54,184
Is there a Mr Gump, Mrs Gump?

71
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,981
He's on vacation.

72
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:20,043
Your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

73
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:27,801
You don't say much, do you?

74
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:44,359
"Finally, he had to try.
It looked easy, but...

75
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,945
"Oh, what happened. First they..."

76
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,575
- Mama, what's vacation mean?
- Vacation?

77
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,453
Where daddy went?

78
00:09:56,204 --> 00:10:02,210
Vacation's when you go somewhere...
and you don't ever come back.

79
00:10:06,882 --> 00:10:11,511
Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.

80
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:15,974
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

81
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,977
There was always
folks coming and going.

82
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:23,732
- Supper! It's supper, everyone!
- That sure looks special.

83
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,318
Sometimes, we had so many people
staying with us

84
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:29,738
that every room was filled,
with travellers, you know,

85
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:35,744
folks living out of their suitcases
and hat cases and sample cases.

86
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,915
Forrest Gump,
it's suppertime! Forrest?

87
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,462
One time, a young man was staying
with us, and he had a guitar case.

88
00:10:59,643 --> 00:11:03,563
Forrest, I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

89
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,190
No, that's all right, ma'am.

90
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:08,694
I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar.

91
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,697
All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

92
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:14,700
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

93
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:20,247
Say, show me that craZy little walk
you did there. Slow it down some.

94
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,461
I liked that guitar. It sounded good.

95
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:34,469
I started moving around to the music,
swinging my hips.

96
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,350
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,

97
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:43,729
and we walked by Benson's furniture
and appliance store, and guess what?

98
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:59,911
This is not for children's eyes.

99
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:06,543
Some years later, that handsome
young man who they called The King,

100
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:09,504
well, he sung too many songs.

101
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,591
Had himself a heart attack
or something.

102
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:15,635
It must be hard being a king.

103
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:21,892
It's funny how you remember some
things, but some things you can't.

104
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,523
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

105
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:33,570
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.

106
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,533
Are you coming along?

107
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:42,079
Mama said not to take rides
from strangers.

108
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:44,164
This is the bus to school.

109
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:52,339
- I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.
- I'm Dorothy Harris.

110
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:54,675
Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

111
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:10,273
This seat's taken.

112
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,777
It's taken.

113
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:23,120
You can't sit here.

114
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:28,917
You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,

115
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,795
'cause I don't remember being born.

116
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,965
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

117
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,760
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic,

118
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,806
but I do remember
the first time I heard

119
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:46,393
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

120
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:49,438
You can sit here if you want.

121
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:55,986
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

122
00:13:56,153 --> 00:13:58,238
She was like an angel.

123
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:01,700
Well, are you going
to sit down or aren't you?

124
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,206
What's wrong with your legs?

125
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:13,128
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

126
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,131
I just sat next to her on that bus

127
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,092
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

128
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,511
My back's crooked
like a question mark.

129
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:26,683
Next to Mama, no one ever talked
to me or asked me questions.

130
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:29,102
Are you stupid or something?

131
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:32,731
Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."

132
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:37,903
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.

133
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:40,739
From that day on,
we was always together.

134
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:43,533
Jenny and me
was like peas and carrots.

135
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:48,538
She taught me how to climb.

136
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:51,041
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

137
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,710
I showed her how to dangle.

138
00:14:55,545 --> 00:15:00,884
She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.

139
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:07,015
Sometimes, we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.

140
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,479
- Mama's going to worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

141
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:16,608
For some reason,
Jenny never wanted to go home.

142
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,403
OK, Jenny, I'll stay.

143
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,948
She was my most special friend.

144
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,829
My only friend.

145
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,418
My Mama always told me
that miracles happen every day.

146
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:38,213
Some people don't think so,
but they do.

147
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:43,427
Hey, dummy!

148
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,013
Are you retarded,
or just plain stupid?

149
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:49,391
- Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.
- Just run away, Forrest.

150
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,729
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

151
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:57,316
- Get the bikes!
- Let's get him! Come on!

152
00:15:57,441 --> 00:16:02,154
Look out, dummy!
We're going to get you!

153
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,491
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

154
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:10,287
Come back here, you!

155
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,554
Run, Forrest! Run!

156
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,880
You wouldn't
believe it if I told you,

157
00:17:02,005 --> 00:17:05,342
but I can run like the wind blows.

158
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:14,601
From that day on, if I was
going somewhere, I was running.

159
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:50,637
That boy sure is a running fool.

160
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:58,478
Remember how I told you that Jenny
never seemed to want to go home?

161
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:02,107
She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

162
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:04,735
Her mama had gone to heaven
when she was five,

163
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,364
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

164
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,325
Jenny?

165
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,452
He was a very loving man.

166
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:17,831
He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.

167
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:24,504
And then this one time, Jenny
wasn't on the bus to go to school.

168
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:27,090
Jenny,
why didn't you come to school today?

169
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:29,968
Daddy's taking a nap.

170
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,096
Come on!

171
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:39,436
Jenny, where'd you run to?
You better get back here, girl!

172
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:43,398
Where you at?

173
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:49,655
Jenny! Jenny, where you at?

174
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,703
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

175
00:18:58,246 --> 00:19:03,460
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly
far, far, far away from here.

176
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:08,465
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far...

177
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,426
Mama always said God is mysterious.

178
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:15,681
He didn't turn Jenny
into a bird that day.

179
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:19,518
Instead, he had the police say

180
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:23,146
Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.

181
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:27,526
She was to live with her grandma,
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

182
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:31,613
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

183
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:38,537
Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out
and come on over to my house,

184
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:44,292
Just 'cause she said she was scared.
Scared of what, I don't know.

185
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:49,923
But I think it was her grandma's dog.
He was a mean dog.

186
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:54,970
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends
all the way up through high school.

187
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:58,849
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

188
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:00,809
Run, Forrest, run!

189
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:05,522
- Didn't you hear me, stupid?
- Run, Forrest!

190
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:10,193
Get in the truck!
Come on! He's getting away! Move it!

191
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,696
Run, Forrest! Run!

192
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:42,893
Run, Forrest!

193
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:49,483
Now, it used to be
I ran to get where I was going.

194
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:53,028
I never thought
it would take me anywhere.

195
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,684
Who in the hell is that?

196
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,605
That is Forrest Gump, coach.
Just a local idiot.

197
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:33,986
And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.

198
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:43,161
- Forrest, move it! Run!
- OK!

199
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:47,165
- Run!
- Run, you stupid son of a bitch!

200
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,889
Run, son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!

201
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:24,453
He must be the stupidest son of
a bitch alive, but he sure is fast.

202
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:32,586
Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.

203
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:36,298
Federal troops,
enforcing a court order,

204
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,633
integrated
the University of Alabama today.

205
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,218
Two Negroes were admitted,

206
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:43,263
but only after Governor George
Wallace had carried out

207
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:46,642
his symbolic threat
to stand in the schoolhouse door.

208
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,438
Earl, what's going on?

209
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:54,024
Coons are trying to get into school.

210
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:57,027
Coons? When racoons
tried getting on our back porch,

211
00:22:57,152 --> 00:22:59,446
Mama just chased them off
with a broom.

212
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:04,409
Not racoons, you idiot. Niggers.
They want to go to school with us.

213
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:06,453
With us? They do?

214
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:08,455
Shortly after Governor Wallace

215
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,416
had carried out his promise
to block the doorway,

216
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,710
President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defence

217
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:15,754
to use military force.

218
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:18,548
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,

219
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:21,218
commander of the national guard,
and Governor Wallace.

220
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:25,514
Because these national guardsmen
are here today

221
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:29,393
as federal soldiers for Alabama,
and they live within our borders.

222
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:33,981
They are our brothers.
We are winning in this fight,

223
00:23:34,106 --> 00:23:38,527
because we are awakening
the American people to the dangers

224
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:43,323
that we have spoken about
so many times, so evident today,

225
00:23:43,448 --> 00:23:47,077
a trend toward military
dictatorship in this country.

226
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,707
And so, at day's end,

227
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:55,627
the University of Alabama
in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,

228
00:23:55,752 --> 00:23:58,922
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

229
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:02,217
had been signed up
for summer classes.

230
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:07,389
Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am.

231
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:10,017
Governor Wallace
did what he promised.

232
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:13,562
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...

233
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:17,232
- Say, wasn't that Gump?
- Naw, that couldn't be.

234
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:20,235
It sure as hell was.

235
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:28,035
A few years later, that angry
little man at the schoolhouse door

236
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,204
thought it'd be a good idea
and ran for President.

237
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:39,838
But somebody thought that it wasn't.
But he didn't die.

238
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:49,014
- My bus is here.
- Is it the number nine?

239
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:53,435
- No, it's the number four.
- It was nice talking to you.

240
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:03,111
I remember when that happened, when
Wallace got shot. I was in college.

241
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:06,281
Did you go to a girls college
or a girls and boys together college?

242
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:08,325
It was coed.

243
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,704
Jenny went to a college I couldn't go
to. It was a college just for girls.

244
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:16,249
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

245
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:48,031
That hurts.

246
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,926
Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
What are you doing?

247
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:13,015
- He was hurting you.
- No, he wasn't! Get over there!

248
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,018
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- Just keep away from me.

249
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:20,022
Don't be such a... Don't go.
Billy, wait a second.

250
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:22,566
He doesn't know any better.

251
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:27,154
Forrest, why'd you do that?

252
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:34,411
I brought you some chocolate.
I'm sorry.

253
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:39,333
I'll go back to my college now.

254
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:46,173
Look at you.

255
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:50,218
Come on. Come on.

256
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:59,811
Is this your own room?

257
00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:08,570
Do you ever dream, Forrest,
about who you're going to be?

258
00:27:10,614 --> 00:27:14,868
Who I'm going to be?
Aren't I going to be me?

259
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:18,288
You'll always be you,
Just another kind of you.

260
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:22,292
You know? I want to be famous.

261
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:27,297
I want to be a singer
like Joan BaeZ.

262
00:27:27,422 --> 00:27:33,553
I just want to be on an empty stage
with my guitar, my voice.

263
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,014
Just me.

264
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:41,311
And I want to reach people
on a personal level.

265
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:47,484
I want to be able to say things,
just one to one.

266
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:57,035
Have you ever been with a girl,
Forrest?

267
00:27:58,912 --> 00:28:03,000
I sit next to them in my home
economics class all the time.

268
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:32,863
I'm sorry.

269
00:28:32,988 --> 00:28:35,324
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

270
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:44,416
It's all right.

271
00:28:47,294 --> 00:28:50,672
- It's OK.
- I'm diZZy.

272
00:28:58,096 --> 00:29:01,600
I'll bet that never
happened in home ec.

273
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:07,189
No.

274
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:16,281
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

275
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,742
I don't care.
I don't like her anyway.

276
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:38,512
College ran by real fast
'cause I played so much football.

277
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:42,307
They even put me on a thing
called the All-America team

278
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:46,103
where you get to meet the President
of the United States.

279
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:49,481
President Kennedy met with the
collegiate All-American football team

280
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:51,191
at the Oval Office today.

281
00:29:51,316 --> 00:29:55,862
The really good thing about meeting
the President of the United States

282
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:59,783
is the food.
They put you in this little room

283
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:03,370
with just about anything
you'd want to eat or drink.

284
00:30:03,495 --> 00:30:06,790
But since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,

285
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:12,546
and number two, they was free, I must
have drank about 15 Dr Peppers.

286
00:30:15,966 --> 00:30:18,552
How does it feel
to be an All-American?

287
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:20,095
It's an honour, sir.

288
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,514
How does it feel
to be an All-American?

289
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:24,558
Very good, sir.

290
00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:27,185
How does it feel
to be an All-American?

291
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:28,603
Very good, sir.

292
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:33,191
- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I got to pee.

293
00:30:33,317 --> 00:30:35,736
I believe he said he had to pee.

294
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:53,337
Some time later,
for no particular reason,

295
00:30:53,462 --> 00:30:58,925
somebody shot that nice young
President when he was in his car.

296
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:03,513
And a few years after that, somebody
shot his little brother, too,

297
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,807
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

298
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,937
Must be hard being brothers.
I wouldn't know.

299
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:15,525
Now can you believe it?

300
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:19,738
After only five years of playing
football, I got a college degree.

301
00:31:19,863 --> 00:31:21,907
Congratulations, son.

302
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:24,076
Mama was so proud.

303
00:31:25,452 --> 00:31:29,331
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
I'll hold this for you.

304
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:31,541
Congratulations, son.

305
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:35,003
Have you given
any thought to your future?

306
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:37,631
Thought?

307
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,801
Hello. I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

308
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:44,137
Nobody gives a horse's shit
who you are, pus ball!

309
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:47,015
You're not even a lowlife,
scum-sucking maggot!

310
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,769
Get your maggoty ass on the bus!
You're in the army now!

311
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:55,607
- Seat's taken.
- Taken.

312
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:01,989
At first it seemed
like I made a mistake.

313
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:06,076
It was only my induction day,
and I was getting yelled at.

314
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,957
Sit down if you want to.

315
00:32:12,457 --> 00:32:16,128
I didn't know who I might meet
or what they might ask.

316
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:18,922
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

317
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:23,510
No. But I been on a real big boat.

318
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:26,555
I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.

319
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,516
I been working on shrimp boats
all my life.

320
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:33,937
I started out on my uncle's boat
when I was about maybe nine.

321
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:38,984
I was just looking into buying
my own boat and got drafted.

322
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:42,362
My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.

323
00:32:42,487 --> 00:32:46,616
People call me Bubba, just like
one of them old redneck boys.

324
00:32:46,742 --> 00:32:48,577
Can you believe that?

325
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:52,998
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

326
00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:57,878
So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre,
Alabama, and his mama cooked shrimp.

327
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:02,132
And her mama before her
cooked shrimp,

328
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:05,802
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

329
00:33:05,927 --> 00:33:08,764
Bubba's family knew
everything there was to know

330
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:10,682
about the shrimping business.

331
00:33:10,807 --> 00:33:14,061
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

332
00:33:14,186 --> 00:33:18,649
I'm going into the shrimping business
myself after I get out of the army.

333
00:33:22,694 --> 00:33:26,490
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this army?

334
00:33:26,615 --> 00:33:29,076
To do whatever you tell me,
drill sergeant!

335
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:32,663
God damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.

336
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:35,248
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

337
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:40,545
You must have a goddamn l.Q. of 160.
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.

338
00:33:41,838 --> 00:33:44,091
Listen up, people!

339
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:48,387
For some reason, I fit in the army
like one of them round pegs.

340
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:50,472
It's not really hard.

341
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:53,892
You just make your bed neat,
remember to stand up straight,

342
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:57,479
and always answer every question
with "Yes, drill sergeant."

343
00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:01,441
- Is that clear?
- Yes, drill sergeant!

344
00:34:01,566 --> 00:34:04,987
What you do is
drag your nets along the bottom.

345
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:09,366
On a good day, you can catch
over a hundred pounds of shrimp.

346
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:12,577
Everything goes all right,
two men shrimping ten hours,

347
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:14,579
Iess what you spends on gas...

348
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:18,417
- Done, drill sergeant!
- Gump!

349
00:34:20,002 --> 00:34:22,796
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?

350
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:24,756
You told me to, drill sergeant.

351
00:34:24,881 --> 00:34:28,552
Jesus H. Christ.
This is a new company record.

352
00:34:28,677 --> 00:34:31,555
If it wasn't a waste
of a fine enlisted man,

353
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,974
I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,
Private Gump.

354
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:36,351
You're going to be a general someday!

355
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:39,146
Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!

356
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,568
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

357
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:49,573
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it.

358
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:52,659
There's shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole,

359
00:34:52,784 --> 00:34:57,956
shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

360
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:02,753
There's pineapple shrimp
and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp,

361
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:06,590
pepper shrimp,
shrimp soup, shrimp stew,

362
00:35:06,715 --> 00:35:13,472
shrimp salad, shrimp in potatoes,
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich.

363
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:17,643
That's about it.

364
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:25,067
Night-time in the army
is a lonely time.

365
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:30,072
We'd lay there in our bunks,
and I'd miss my mama,

366
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:32,699
and I'd miss Jenny.

367
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:40,082
Gump, get a load of the tits on her.

368
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:57,099
Turns out Jenny had gotten
into some trouble

369
00:35:57,224 --> 00:36:00,477
over some photos of her
in her college sweater.

370
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:02,646
And she was thrown out of school.

371
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:08,568
But that wasn't a bad thing,

372
00:36:08,694 --> 00:36:12,572
'cause a man who owns a theatre
in Memphis, Tennessee,

373
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:18,036
saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

374
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,541
The first chance I got,
I took the bus up to Memphis

375
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:24,751
to see her perform in that show.

376
00:36:24,876 --> 00:36:27,838
That was Amber, Amber Flame.
Give her a big hand.

377
00:36:27,963 --> 00:36:30,757
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

378
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:34,553
direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty.

379
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:38,598
Let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbie Dylon.

380
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:10,964
Her dream had come true.
She was a folk singer.

381
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,978
- Come on baby, shake it up now!
- Somebody get her a harmonica.

382
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,487
- This ain't Captain Kangaroo!
- I got something here for you.

383
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:35,238
God damn it!

384
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:40,077
Hey, you stupid jerk!
I'm singing a song here.

385
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:44,790
Paulie, get out here!

386
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,876
Shut up!

387
00:37:50,712 --> 00:37:55,425
Forrest! What are you doing here?
What are you doing?

388
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:59,262
What are you doing, Forrest?
Let me down!

389
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:08,939
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.
You can't keep trying to rescue me.

390
00:38:09,064 --> 00:38:13,276
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

391
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:17,364
You can't keep
doing this all the time.

392
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:20,867
I can't help it. I love you.

393
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:25,330
You don't know what love is.

394
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:35,757
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

395
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:41,763
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far away?

396
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:45,183
Yes, I do.

397
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:50,022
You think
I could fly off this bridge?

398
00:38:57,279 --> 00:39:00,324
What do you mean, Jenny?

399
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,412
Nothing.

400
00:39:07,831 --> 00:39:10,167
I gotta get out of here.

401
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:16,006
- Wait, Jenny.
- Forrest, you stay away from me, OK?

402
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:18,008
Just stay away from me, please.

403
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,802
- Can I have a ride?
- Where are you going?

404
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:23,388
- I don't care.
- Get in the truck.

405
00:39:23,513 --> 00:39:25,557
So bye-bye, Jenny.

406
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:29,519
They sending me to vietnam.

407
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:33,857
It's this whole other country.

408
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,404
Just hang on a minute.

409
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:43,367
Listen, you promise me something, OK?

410
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:46,536
Just if you're ever in trouble,
don't be brave.

411
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:50,666
- You just run, OK? Just run away.
- OK.

412
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:01,927
I'll write you all the time.

413
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:14,272
And just like that, she was gone.

414
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,500
You come back safe to me.
Do you hear?

415
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:20,839
They told us that vietnam
was going to be very different

416
00:41:20,964 --> 00:41:23,091
from the United States of America.

417
00:41:23,216 --> 00:41:29,139
Except for all the beer cans
and barbecues, it was.

418
00:41:38,815 --> 00:41:41,902
I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

419
00:41:42,027 --> 00:41:44,905
They tell me these vietnams
is good shrimp.

420
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,659
After we win this war
and we take over everything,

421
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:52,329
we can get American shrimpers out
here and shrimp these waters.

422
00:41:52,454 --> 00:41:54,373
Just shrimp all the time, man.

423
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:00,545
- You must be my FNGs.
- Morning, sir.

424
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:03,507
Get your hands down.
Do not salute me.

425
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:06,134
There are goddamn snipers
all around this area

426
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:08,303
who'd love to grease an officer.

427
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:11,556
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.

428
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:17,729
- What's wrong with your lip?
- I was born with big gums, sir.

429
00:42:17,854 --> 00:42:22,401
Well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

430
00:42:23,527 --> 00:42:25,529
Where are you boys from in the world?

431
00:42:25,654 --> 00:42:29,449
- Alabama, sir!
- You twins?

432
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:34,287
No. We are not relations, sir.

433
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:42,421
Look, it's pretty basic here.
You stick with me and learn

434
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:46,216
from the guys who've been in country
a while, you'll be all right.

435
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:48,427
There is one item of G.I. gear

436
00:42:48,552 --> 00:42:52,681
that can be the difference
between life and death. Socks.

437
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:56,768
Cushioned sole, O.D. Green.
Try and keep your feet dry.

438
00:42:56,893 --> 00:43:00,647
When we're out humpin',
change your socks whenever we stop.

439
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:04,192
The Mekong will eat
a grunt's feet right off his legs.

440
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,405
Sergeant Sims. God damn it, where's
that sling rope I said to order?

441
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:12,367
- I put in the requisitions.
- Well, call those sons of bitches...

442
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:17,414
Lieutenant Dan knew his stuff. I felt
real lucky he was my lieutenant.

443
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:21,251
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

444
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:25,380
Somebody in his family
had fought and died

445
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:29,426
in every single American war.

446
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:33,680
God damn it, kick some ass.
Get on it!

447
00:43:33,805 --> 00:43:37,643
I guess you could say
he had a lot to live up to.

448
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:43,690
So, you boys from Arkansas?
Well, I been through there.

449
00:43:43,815 --> 00:43:46,485
Little Rock's a fine town.

450
00:43:46,568 --> 00:43:49,696
Now, shake down your gear.
See the platoon sergeant.

451
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:52,491
Draw what you need for the field.

452
00:43:52,574 --> 00:43:56,870
If you boys are hungry, we got
steaks burning right over here.

453
00:43:56,995 --> 00:44:02,501
Two standing orders in this platoon.
One, take good care of your feet.

454
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:08,215
Two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

455
00:44:13,303 --> 00:44:15,305
I sure hope I don't let him down.

456
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:33,115
I got to see a lot of countryside.
We would take these real long walks.

457
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:44,876
And we were always lookin'
for this guy named Charlie.

458
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:55,887
- Hold it up!
- Hold up, boys!

459
00:44:57,556 --> 00:45:00,392
It wasn't always fun.

460
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:03,812
Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings

461
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:09,985
about a rock or a trail or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up.

462
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,404
Get down! Shut up!

463
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,407
So we did.

464
00:45:32,174 --> 00:45:34,509
I don't know much about anything,

465
00:45:34,635 --> 00:45:38,263
but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.

466
00:45:38,388 --> 00:45:40,474
There was Dallas from Phoenix.

467
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:45,228
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.

468
00:45:45,354 --> 00:45:49,900
Hey, Tex. What the hell's going on?

469
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:55,072
And Tex was... Well, I don't
remember where Tex come from.

470
00:45:55,197 --> 00:45:57,199
Ah, nothing.

471
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:02,371
Fourth platoon, on your feet.

472
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:06,917
Y'all got 10 clicks
to go to that river. Move out.

473
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:13,632
- One, two, hup!
- Step it up! Look alive out there.

474
00:46:13,757 --> 00:46:17,386
The good thing about vietnam
is there was always someplace to go.

475
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:19,471
Fire in the hole!

476
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:24,977
Gump, check out that hole.

477
00:46:25,102 --> 00:46:27,980
And there was always something to do.

478
00:46:28,105 --> 00:46:31,066
Mount 'em up!
Spread out! Cover his back!

479
00:46:36,113 --> 00:46:42,202
One day it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.

480
00:46:42,327 --> 00:46:45,497
We've been through every
kind of rain there is.

481
00:46:45,622 --> 00:46:52,337
Little bitty stinging rain
and big old fat rain,

482
00:46:52,462 --> 00:46:56,883
rain that flew in sideways,
and sometimes rain even seemed

483
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:00,470
to come straight up from underneath.

484
00:47:00,595 --> 00:47:03,974
Shoot, it even rained at night.

485
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:06,977
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

486
00:47:07,102 --> 00:47:10,814
I'm going to lean up against you.
You lean up against me.

487
00:47:10,939 --> 00:47:15,152
This way we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

488
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:17,779
You know why
we're a good partnership, Forrest?

489
00:47:17,904 --> 00:47:23,035
'Cause we be watching out for one
another, like brothers and stuff.

490
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:28,582
Hey, Forrest,
something I been thinking about.

491
00:47:28,707 --> 00:47:31,626
I got a very important question
to ask you.

492
00:47:33,503 --> 00:47:37,215
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

493
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:42,012
- OK.
- Man, I tell you what.

494
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:44,389
I got it all figured out, too.

495
00:47:44,514 --> 00:47:47,392
So many pounds of shrimp
will pay off the boat.

496
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:50,771
So many pounds for gas.
We'll live right on the boat.

497
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:53,190
We ain't got to pay no rent.

498
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:57,152
We can just work it together, split
everything right down the middle.

499
00:47:57,277 --> 00:48:02,449
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50. Hey,
Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.

500
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:06,578
That's a fine idea.

501
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:09,414
Bubba did have a fine idea.

502
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:16,296
I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.

503
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:20,092
I sent her letters.
Not every day, but almost.

504
00:48:20,217 --> 00:48:24,888
I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,

505
00:48:25,013 --> 00:48:28,058
and told her
how I thought about her always.

506
00:48:29,518 --> 00:48:33,438
And how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her

507
00:48:33,563 --> 00:48:36,400
Just as soon as she had the time.

508
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:39,361
I'd always let her know
that I was OK.

509
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:46,785
Then I'd sign each letter
"Love, Forrest Gump."

510
00:49:00,882 --> 00:49:04,344
This one day,
we was out walking like always,

511
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:10,350
and then, just like that,
somebody turned off the rain,

512
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:12,978
and the sun come out.

513
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:18,317
Ambush! Take cover!

514
00:49:27,492 --> 00:49:32,372
- Get that pig up here, God damn it!
- Forrest, are you OK?

515
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,419
Strong Arm, Strong Arm!

516
00:49:39,588 --> 00:49:44,426
- We've got a man down.
- Strong Arm, this is Leg Lima 6!

517
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:49,389
Roger, Strong Arm! We have incoming
from the treeline at Point Blue...

518
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:53,060
..plus two! A.K.s and rockets!
We're getting it hard!

519
00:49:53,185 --> 00:49:57,481
- Misfire! Misfire!
- God damn it!

520
00:49:59,191 --> 00:50:03,111
Get that pig unfucked
and put it in the treeline!

521
00:50:04,905 --> 00:50:07,366
They got us down, hard and hurt.

522
00:50:07,491 --> 00:50:11,078
We're going to move back
to the blue line.

523
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,997
Pull back! Pull back!

524
00:50:14,247 --> 00:50:18,043
- Forrest! Run, Forrest!
- Pull back!

525
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:22,631
- Run! Run, man! Run!
- Pull back, Gump!

526
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,302
Run, God damn it! Run!

527
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:57,416
I ran and ran
Just like Jenny told me to.

528
00:51:00,627 --> 00:51:06,383
I ran so far so fast that soon I was
all by myself, which was a bad thing.

529
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:14,808
Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure he was OK.

530
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,361
Where the hell are you?

531
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:34,328
And on my way back to find Bubba,
there was a boy laying on the ground.

532
00:51:34,453 --> 00:51:38,457
Tex. OK.

533
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:42,878
I couldn't let him lay there
all alone, scared the way he was,

534
00:51:43,003 --> 00:51:46,465
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.

535
00:52:01,813 --> 00:52:04,650
Every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

536
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:09,071
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest, help me!"

537
00:52:15,577 --> 00:52:17,788
OK. Here. Here.

538
00:52:20,248 --> 00:52:23,085
No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be OK.

539
00:52:25,337 --> 00:52:29,883
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

540
00:52:30,008 --> 00:52:35,847
I know my position is danger close!
We got Charlie all over this area.

541
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:38,850
I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

542
00:52:38,976 --> 00:52:41,269
Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

543
00:52:41,395 --> 00:52:45,857
I know he's dead! My whole
goddamn platoon is wiped out!

544
00:52:45,983 --> 00:52:50,862
God damn it! What are you doing?
You leave me here!

545
00:52:50,988 --> 00:52:54,491
Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

546
00:52:54,616 --> 00:52:58,245
God, I said leave me here,
God damn it!

547
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,831
Leg Lima six, this is strong-arm.

548
00:53:00,956 --> 00:53:03,959
Be advised your fast
movers are inbound. Over.

549
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,212
Then it felt like something
Just jumped up and bit me.

550
00:53:07,337 --> 00:53:10,007
Something bit me!

551
00:53:17,222 --> 00:53:19,099
Goddamn son of a bitch!

552
00:53:20,434 --> 00:53:26,440
I can't leave the platoon.
I told you to leave me there, Gump.

553
00:53:26,565 --> 00:53:30,819
Forget about me. Get yourself out!
Did you hear what I said?

554
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:35,407
Gump, damn it, put me down.
Get your ass out of here.

555
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:41,246
I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!

556
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:44,666
- Where do you think you're going?
- To get Bubba.

557
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:46,793
I got an air strike
inbound right now.

558
00:53:46,918 --> 00:53:51,423
They're going to nape the whole area.
Stay here! That's an order.

559
00:53:51,548 --> 00:53:54,009
I gotta find Bubba!

560
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:23,163
I'm OK, Forrest. I'm OK.

561
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:35,509
- Bubba, no.
- I'll be all right.

562
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:46,812
Come on. Come on. Come on.

563
00:54:51,608 --> 00:54:53,402
I'm OK, Forrest.

564
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:58,281
I'm OK. I'm fine.

565
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:37,946
Top smoke. Get it up there.

566
00:55:38,196 --> 00:55:42,409
If I'd have known this was going
to be the last time me and Bubba

567
00:55:42,534 --> 00:55:45,912
was gonna talk, I'd of thought
of something better to say.

568
00:55:46,038 --> 00:55:50,042
- Hey, Bubba.
- Hey, Forrest.

569
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:58,467
- Forrest, why did this happen?
- You got shot.

570
00:55:59,509 --> 00:56:03,972
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

571
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:06,808
I want to go home.

572
00:56:07,726 --> 00:56:11,188
Bubba was my best good friend.

573
00:56:11,313 --> 00:56:15,984
And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

574
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:19,321
Bubba was going to be
a shrimping boat captain,

575
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:23,825
but instead, he died right
there by that river in Vietnam.

576
00:56:27,996 --> 00:56:29,998
That's all I have to say about that.

577
00:56:33,418 --> 00:56:36,171
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

578
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:42,344
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

579
00:56:44,304 --> 00:56:47,933
Yes, sir.
Bit me directly in the but-tocks.

580
00:56:48,058 --> 00:56:52,354
They said it was a million
dollar wound, but...

581
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,481
The army must keep that money,

582
00:56:54,606 --> 00:56:58,360
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

583
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:02,322
The only good thing
about being wounded in the but-tocks

584
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:04,366
is the ice cream.

585
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:08,787
They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat. And guess what?

586
00:57:08,912 --> 00:57:12,958
A good friend of mine was
in the bed right next door.

587
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:18,380
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

588
00:57:18,505 --> 00:57:21,550
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!

589
00:57:32,644 --> 00:57:35,439
It's time for your bath,
Lieutenant.

590
00:57:44,072 --> 00:57:45,365
Harper!

591
00:57:48,744 --> 00:57:52,205
Cooper. Larson.

592
00:57:53,457 --> 00:57:57,377
Webster. Gump.

593
00:57:57,502 --> 00:58:00,172
- Gump!
- I'm Forrest Gump.

594
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:07,012
Kyle. Nichols.

595
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:12,643
McMill. Johnson.

596
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:34,039
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit? Turn it off.

597
00:58:34,164 --> 00:58:36,917
You are tuned to the American Forces
Vietnam Network.

598
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:39,378
This is Channel 6, Saigon.

599
00:58:42,172 --> 00:58:46,802
Good catch, Gump.
You know how to play this?

600
00:58:49,221 --> 00:58:51,807
Come on. Let me show you.

601
00:58:53,308 --> 00:58:57,771
The secret to this game is
no matter what happens,

602
00:58:57,896 --> 00:59:03,318
never, ever take your eye
off the ball.

603
00:59:05,028 --> 00:59:06,738
All right.

604
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,662
For some reason, ping-pong
came very natural to me.

605
00:59:13,787 --> 00:59:17,082
See? Any idiot can play.

606
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:19,543
So I started playing it all the time.

607
00:59:20,502 --> 00:59:25,716
I played ping-pong even when I didn't
have anyone to play ping-pong with.

608
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:39,521
The hospital's people said it
made me look like a duck in water,

609
00:59:39,646 --> 00:59:41,315
whatever that means.

610
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,735
Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.

611
00:59:49,489 --> 00:59:54,911
I played ping-pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.

612
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,673
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

613
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,093
Nothing just happens.
It's all part of a plan!

614
01:00:10,218 --> 01:00:13,180
I should have died
out there with my men,

615
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:18,435
but now, I'm nothing but
a goddamn cripple, a legless freak!

616
01:00:19,478 --> 01:00:22,606
Look. Look! Look at me!
You see that?

617
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:26,610
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

618
01:00:29,446 --> 01:00:31,531
Yes, sir, I do.

619
01:00:34,993 --> 01:00:40,332
Did you hear what I said?
You cheated me! I had a destiny.

620
01:00:40,457 --> 01:00:44,252
I was supposed to die in the field
with honour!

621
01:00:44,795 --> 01:00:49,508
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

622
01:00:57,933 --> 01:01:00,352
You understand what I'm saying, Gump?

623
01:01:03,605 --> 01:01:10,696
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me. I had a destiny.

624
01:01:12,906 --> 01:01:17,452
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

625
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:26,712
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

626
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,530
Look at me.
What am I going to do now?

627
01:01:56,908 --> 01:01:59,870
What am I going to do now?

628
01:02:09,504 --> 01:02:11,757
PFC Gump?

629
01:02:12,924 --> 01:02:16,136
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

630
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:21,016
Son, you been awarded
the Medal of Honour.

631
01:02:21,141 --> 01:02:26,480
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?
They want to give me a med...

632
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:36,615
Ma'am, what did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

633
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:38,575
They sent him home.

634
01:02:45,123 --> 01:02:48,377
Two weeks later, I left vietnam.

635
01:02:48,502 --> 01:02:52,089
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President

636
01:02:52,214 --> 01:02:56,051
regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.

637
01:02:56,176 --> 01:02:59,638
President Johnson awarded four medals
of honour to men from each...

638
01:02:59,763 --> 01:03:02,557
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

639
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,355
I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?

640
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,107
In the but-tocks, sir.

641
01:03:10,232 --> 01:03:14,736
Well, that must be a sight.
I'd kinda like to see that.

642
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:29,459
God damn, son!

643
01:03:32,462 --> 01:03:35,757
After that, Mama went
to the hotel to lay down,

644
01:03:35,882 --> 01:03:39,803
so I went out for a walk
to see our capital.

645
01:03:39,928 --> 01:03:44,808
Hilary! I got the vets.
What do you want to do with them?

646
01:03:44,933 --> 01:03:47,394
It's a good thing Mama was resting,

647
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:50,397
'cause the streets was
awful crowded with people

648
01:03:50,522 --> 01:03:53,400
Iookin' at all the statues
and monuments,

649
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:55,652
and some of them people
were loud and pushy.

650
01:03:55,777 --> 01:03:58,280
OK, follow me! Move it out!

651
01:03:58,405 --> 01:04:01,742
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

652
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:10,667
Come on. Go!

653
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:24,306
You're a good man
for doing this. Good.

654
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:26,516
OK.

655
01:04:26,642 --> 01:04:28,644
There was this man
giving a little talk.

656
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:33,231
And for some reason, he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.

657
01:04:34,941 --> 01:04:38,779
And he liked to say
the "F" Word a lot.

658
01:04:38,904 --> 01:04:41,198
"F" This and "F" That.

659
01:04:41,323 --> 01:04:46,828
And every time he said the "F" Word,
people, for some reason, cheered.

660
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:56,213
Come on, man. Come up here, man.

661
01:04:56,338 --> 01:04:59,967
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move!

662
01:05:01,551 --> 01:05:03,470
Go on. Let's get up there.

663
01:05:16,024 --> 01:05:18,944
Tell us a little bit
about the war, man.

664
01:05:19,069 --> 01:05:25,617
- The war in vietnam?
- The war in Viet-fuckin'-nam!

665
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:51,018
Well...

666
01:05:51,143 --> 01:05:55,522
There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.

667
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:59,901
There's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.

668
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:05,449
In vietnam...

669
01:06:16,501 --> 01:06:18,420
What the hell are you do...

670
01:06:18,545 --> 01:06:21,381
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

671
01:06:21,506 --> 01:06:23,884
Jesus Christ!
What did they do with this?

672
01:06:24,885 --> 01:06:26,845
Can't hear you!

673
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:29,765
Can't hear anything!

674
01:06:31,016 --> 01:06:32,851
This... This one! Give me that!

675
01:06:32,976 --> 01:06:35,520
Speak up!

676
01:06:35,646 --> 01:06:37,481
That's it.

677
01:06:37,606 --> 01:06:42,277
And that's all I have to say
about that.

678
01:06:48,033 --> 01:06:51,745
That's so right on, man.
You said it all.

679
01:06:53,372 --> 01:06:58,543
- What's your name, man?
- My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

680
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:02,089
- Forrest Gump.
- Gump!

681
01:07:41,086 --> 01:07:44,923
It was the happiest moment
of my life.

682
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,053
Jenny and me were just
like peas and carrots again.

683
01:07:51,722 --> 01:07:56,018
She showed me around and introduced
me to some of her new friends.

684
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:59,521
Shut that blind, man! And get your
white ass away from that window.

685
01:07:59,646 --> 01:08:01,982
Don't you know we in a war here?

686
01:08:02,107 --> 01:08:05,902
- He's cool. He's one of us.
- Let me tell you about us.

687
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:08,196
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

688
01:08:08,322 --> 01:08:10,282
from the racial onslaught of the pig

689
01:08:10,407 --> 01:08:12,326
who wishes to brutalise
our black leaders,

690
01:08:12,451 --> 01:08:16,455
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

691
01:08:17,706 --> 01:08:21,918
- Who's the baby killer?
- This is my friend I told you about.

692
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:24,921
This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.

693
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:27,507
Wesley and l
lived together in Berkeley,

694
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:30,510
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

695
01:08:30,636 --> 01:08:33,513
We are here to offer
protection and help

696
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:36,975
for all those who need our help,
because we, the Black Panthers,

697
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,519
are against the war in vietnam.

698
01:08:39,645 --> 01:08:42,689
We are against any war where black
soldiers are sent to the front line

699
01:08:42,814 --> 01:08:44,650
to die for a country that hates them.

700
01:08:44,775 --> 01:08:48,570
We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

701
01:08:48,695 --> 01:08:52,449
and come to be brutalised
and killed in their own communities.

702
01:08:52,574 --> 01:08:56,203
We are against all these racist
and imperial acts...

703
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:15,222
Forrest! Stop it! Stop it!

704
01:09:24,022 --> 01:09:26,566
I shouldn't have brought you here.

705
01:09:26,692 --> 01:09:30,654
I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!

706
01:09:31,321 --> 01:09:33,991
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

707
01:09:39,037 --> 01:09:41,039
Come on, Forrest.

708
01:09:46,044 --> 01:09:50,799
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

709
01:09:52,467 --> 01:09:55,304
He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.

710
01:09:55,429 --> 01:09:58,015
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

711
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:06,523
- I know you wouldn't, Forrest.
- I wanted to be your boyfriend.

712
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:23,915
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.
You look handsome in it. You do.

713
01:10:27,919 --> 01:10:30,631
- You know what?
- What?

714
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:36,928
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

715
01:10:38,597 --> 01:10:40,390
Me, too, Forrest.

716
01:10:40,515 --> 01:10:45,354
We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talkin'.

717
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:50,859
She told me about
all the travelling she'd done

718
01:10:50,984 --> 01:10:54,738
and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind

719
01:10:54,863 --> 01:11:00,410
and learn how to live in harmony,
which must be out west somewhere,

720
01:11:00,535 --> 01:11:04,206
'cause she made it
all the way to California.

721
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:09,586
Hey. Anybody
want to go to San Francisco?

722
01:11:09,711 --> 01:11:12,756
- I'll go.
- Far out!

723
01:11:12,881 --> 01:11:16,927
It was a very special night
for the two of us.

724
01:11:18,762 --> 01:11:20,722
I didn't want it to end.

725
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:26,269
- Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.
- I have to, Forrest.

726
01:11:27,938 --> 01:11:32,776
Jenny?
Things got a little out of hand.

727
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:37,823
It's just this war and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...

728
01:11:39,324 --> 01:11:42,160
I would never hurt you.
You know that.

729
01:11:44,955 --> 01:11:46,999
Know what I think?

730
01:11:49,001 --> 01:11:54,172
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

731
01:12:04,516 --> 01:12:09,688
Forrest, we have very different
lives, you know.

732
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:22,075
I want you to have this.

733
01:12:26,538 --> 01:12:28,540
Forrest, I can't keep this.

734
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:35,339
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

735
01:12:36,923 --> 01:12:41,678
- Why are you so good to me?
- You're my girl.

736
01:12:44,306 --> 01:12:46,600
I'll always be your girl.

737
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:31,228
And just like that,
she was gone out of my life again.

738
01:13:33,105 --> 01:13:40,320
It's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.

739
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:49,454
I thought I was going back
to Vietnam, but instead they decided

740
01:13:49,579 --> 01:13:53,792
the best way for me to fight
the communists was to play ping-pong,

741
01:13:53,917 --> 01:13:57,629
so I was in the Special Services,
travelling around the country,

742
01:13:57,754 --> 01:14:01,800
cheering up wounded veterans and
showing 'em how to play ping-pong.

743
01:14:01,925 --> 01:14:03,468
I was so good,

744
01:14:03,593 --> 01:14:06,972
the Army decided I should be
on the All-American ping-pong team.

745
01:14:08,015 --> 01:14:11,393
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

746
01:14:11,518 --> 01:14:13,395
in a million years or something.

747
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,398
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

748
01:14:16,523 --> 01:14:19,109
but all I did was play ping-pong.

749
01:14:19,234 --> 01:14:22,779
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity,

750
01:14:22,904 --> 01:14:25,824
famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

751
01:14:25,949 --> 01:14:29,286
Here he is, Forrest Gump. Right here.

752
01:14:38,211 --> 01:14:42,799
- Forrest Gump, John Lennon.
- Welcome home.

753
01:14:42,924 --> 01:14:47,095
Can you tell us, what was China like?

754
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:54,811
In the land of China,
people hardly got nothin' at all.

755
01:14:54,936 --> 01:14:56,730
No possessions?

756
01:14:59,191 --> 01:15:03,820
And in China,
they never go to church.

757
01:15:03,945 --> 01:15:08,659
- No religion, too?
- Hard to imagine.

758
01:15:09,242 --> 01:15:12,412
Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

759
01:15:12,537 --> 01:15:15,832
Some years later,
that nice young man from England

760
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:20,796
was on his way home to see his little
boy and was signing some autographs.

761
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:25,384
For no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.

762
01:15:27,928 --> 01:15:31,932
They gave you
The Congressional Medal of Honour.

763
01:15:33,433 --> 01:15:35,143
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

764
01:15:37,938 --> 01:15:39,731
Lieutenant Dan!

765
01:15:39,856 --> 01:15:44,820
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honour.

766
01:15:45,946 --> 01:15:47,781
Yes, sir. They surely did.

767
01:15:47,906 --> 01:15:53,412
They gave you, an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

768
01:15:53,537 --> 01:15:58,875
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

769
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:01,378
the Congressional Medal of Honour.

770
01:16:02,045 --> 01:16:03,839
Yes, sir.

771
01:16:05,924 --> 01:16:09,136
Well, that's just perfect!

772
01:16:10,637 --> 01:16:15,851
Well, I just got one thing to say
to that. Goddamn bless America.

773
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:26,278
Lieutenant Dan!

774
01:16:26,403 --> 01:16:29,948
Lieutenant Dan
said he was living in a hotel.

775
01:16:30,073 --> 01:16:35,245
Because he didn't have no legs, he
spent his time exercising his arms.

776
01:16:37,497 --> 01:16:39,374
Take a right. Take a right!

777
01:16:43,128 --> 01:16:44,921
Come on, already!

778
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:48,383
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

779
01:16:48,508 --> 01:16:50,802
I'm living off the government tit.

780
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:59,811
Are you blind? I'm walking here!
Get out! Come on. Go, go, go!

781
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:11,323
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.

782
01:17:15,243 --> 01:17:19,790
You have a great year,
and hurry home. God bless you.

783
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,212
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

784
01:17:25,337 --> 01:17:29,466
I didn't know I was supposed
to be looking for him, sir.

785
01:17:37,182 --> 01:17:42,437
That's all these cripples at the vA,
that's all they ever talk about.

786
01:17:44,147 --> 01:17:50,570
Jesus this and Jesus that.
Have I found Jesus?

787
01:17:51,363 --> 01:17:54,741
They even had a priest
come and talk to me.

788
01:17:54,866 --> 01:18:00,455
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

789
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:03,417
Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,

790
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:07,838
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

791
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:10,257
Did you hear what I said?

792
01:18:11,591 --> 01:18:15,887
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

793
01:18:16,013 --> 01:18:22,269
Well, kiss my crippled ass. God
is listening? What a crock of shit.

794
01:18:25,605 --> 01:18:28,025
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

795
01:18:35,949 --> 01:18:37,284
Well...

796
01:18:39,995 --> 01:18:43,874
Before you go, why don't you
get your ass down to the corner

797
01:18:43,999 --> 01:18:46,752
- and get us more ripple?
- Yes, sir.

798
01:18:46,877 --> 01:18:51,089
We're at approximately 45th street
in New York City at One Astor PlaZa.

799
01:18:51,214 --> 01:18:53,467
This is the site
of the old Astor Hotel...

800
01:18:53,592 --> 01:18:57,512
- What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?
- Shrimping boats.

801
01:18:57,638 --> 01:19:00,849
Shrimping boats? Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

802
01:19:00,974 --> 01:19:04,895
I got to buy me one
soon as I have some money.

803
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,480
I promised Bubba in vietnam

804
01:19:06,605 --> 01:19:09,858
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd be partners.

805
01:19:09,983 --> 01:19:13,487
He'd be the captain
and I'd be his first mate.

806
01:19:13,612 --> 01:19:16,448
But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.

807
01:19:16,573 --> 01:19:18,450
A shrimp boat captain.

808
01:19:18,575 --> 01:19:21,703
Yes, sir. A promise is a promise,
Lieutenant Dan.

809
01:19:23,956 --> 01:19:25,874
Now hear this!

810
01:19:27,334 --> 01:19:31,755
Private Gump here is gonna be
a shrimp boat captain.

811
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:35,717
Tell you what, Gilligan. The day
you are a shrimp boat captain,

812
01:19:35,842 --> 01:19:38,053
I will come and be your first mate.

813
01:19:39,554 --> 01:19:44,476
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut!

814
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:47,854
Danny, what are you complaining
about? How you doing?

815
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:53,485
- Mr Hot Wheels. Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

816
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:57,906
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-limbs Lenore.

817
01:19:58,031 --> 01:20:01,868
So where you been, babycakes?
Haven't seen you around lately.

818
01:20:01,994 --> 01:20:04,454
You should have been here
for Christmas,

819
01:20:04,579 --> 01:20:08,458
'cause Tommy bought a free round
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

820
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:10,419
Well, I had company.

821
01:20:10,585 --> 01:20:14,464
We was just there!
That's Times Square.

822
01:20:14,589 --> 01:20:19,469
Don't you just love New Year's?
You can start all over.

823
01:20:19,594 --> 01:20:22,264
Everybody gets a second chance.

824
01:20:22,848 --> 01:20:25,726
It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

825
01:20:25,851 --> 01:20:27,811
I began to think about Jenny,

826
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:32,524
wondering how she was spending her
New Year's night out in California.

827
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,383
Nine, eight, seven, six,

828
01:20:58,508 --> 01:21:04,598
five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!

829
01:21:21,907 --> 01:21:24,785
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

830
01:21:59,486 --> 01:22:03,365
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

831
01:22:03,490 --> 01:22:08,412
What's his problem? Did you lose
your packet in the war or something?

832
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:11,373
- Is your friend stupid or something?
- What did you say?

833
01:22:11,498 --> 01:22:13,792
I said is your friend
stupid or something?

834
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:16,753
- Don't call him stupid!
- Hey, don't push her!

835
01:22:16,878 --> 01:22:19,798
You shut up!
Don't you ever call him stupid!

836
01:22:19,923 --> 01:22:22,217
Why you so upset?

837
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:25,846
Get your goddamn clothes
and get the hell out of here!

838
01:22:25,971 --> 01:22:29,099
You should be in a sideshow.
You're so pathetic!

839
01:22:29,224 --> 01:22:30,642
Get out of here!

840
01:22:30,767 --> 01:22:34,229
- You retard!
- Loser. You freak!

841
01:22:38,817 --> 01:22:40,610
Oh, no.

842
01:23:05,427 --> 01:23:09,723
I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's
Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

843
01:23:09,848 --> 01:23:12,184
She tastes like cigarettes.

844
01:23:28,408 --> 01:23:33,163
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured
there's some things you can't change.

845
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:36,208
He didn't want to be called crippled

846
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:39,753
Iike I didn't want
to be called stupid.

847
01:23:43,799 --> 01:23:46,009
Happy New Year, Gump.

848
01:23:51,223 --> 01:23:53,684
The U.S. ping-pong team met
with President Nixon today...

849
01:23:53,809 --> 01:23:57,270
Wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

850
01:23:57,396 --> 01:24:01,692
they invited me and the ping-pong
team to visit the White House.

851
01:24:01,817 --> 01:24:04,778
So I went, again.

852
01:24:04,903 --> 01:24:08,448
And I met the President
of the United States again.

853
01:24:08,573 --> 01:24:12,703
Only this time, they didn't get us
rooms in a real fancy hotel.

854
01:24:12,828 --> 01:24:16,290
Are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

855
01:24:16,415 --> 01:24:19,543
- Where are you staying?
- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

856
01:24:19,668 --> 01:24:22,170
Oh, no. I know a much nicer hotel.

857
01:24:22,296 --> 01:24:26,591
It's brand-new. very modern.
I'll have my people take care of it.

858
01:24:26,717 --> 01:24:29,303
- Security.
- Yeah. Sir...

859
01:24:29,428 --> 01:24:34,766
You might want to send a maintenance
man to that office across the way.

860
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:39,271
The lights are off and they must be
looking for a fuse box,

861
01:24:39,396 --> 01:24:42,316
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

862
01:24:42,441 --> 01:24:46,069
- OK, sir. I'll check it out.
- Thank you. Good night.

863
01:24:48,822 --> 01:24:52,284
Therefore,
I shall resign the presidency

864
01:24:52,409 --> 01:24:56,705
effective at noon tomorrow.
Vice President Ford

865
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:01,627
will be sworn in as President
at that hour in this office.

866
01:25:12,804 --> 01:25:15,724
- Forrest Gump.
- Yes, sir!

867
01:25:15,849 --> 01:25:21,647
As you were. I have your
discharge papers. Service is up, son.

868
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,735
Does this mean
I can't play ping-pong no more?

869
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,820
For the Army, it does.

870
01:25:30,822 --> 01:25:36,328
And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

871
01:25:40,832 --> 01:25:42,793
So I went home.

872
01:26:04,606 --> 01:26:08,610
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know. I know.

873
01:26:10,028 --> 01:26:11,488
Louise, he's here.

874
01:26:11,613 --> 01:26:15,659
When I got home, I had no idea,
but Mama'd had all sorts of visitors.

875
01:26:15,784 --> 01:26:18,453
We've had all sorts of visitors.

876
01:26:18,537 --> 01:26:21,248
Everybody wants you to use
their ping-pong stuff.

877
01:26:21,373 --> 01:26:25,043
One man even left a check for $25,000

878
01:26:25,168 --> 01:26:28,922
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.

879
01:26:29,047 --> 01:26:31,425
I only like using my own paddle.

880
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:33,635
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

881
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,514
I know that,
but it's $25,000, Forrest.

882
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:40,934
I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,

883
01:26:41,059 --> 01:26:43,520
see if it grows on you.

884
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:48,191
That Mama, she sure was right.
It's funny how things work out.

885
01:26:48,317 --> 01:26:50,277
I didn't stay home for long

886
01:26:50,402 --> 01:26:55,324
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,
and I always try to keep my promise,

887
01:26:55,449 --> 01:26:59,286
so I went on down to Bayou La Batre
to meet Bubba's family.

888
01:26:59,411 --> 01:27:03,832
Are you craZy or just plain stupid?

889
01:27:03,957 --> 01:27:08,003
- Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs Blue.
- I guess.

890
01:27:08,211 --> 01:27:12,799
And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

891
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:16,678
Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.

892
01:27:19,973 --> 01:27:24,895
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

893
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:34,363
I'm taking $24,562.47 that I got,

894
01:27:34,488 --> 01:27:37,866
that's left after a new haircut
and a new suit

895
01:27:37,991 --> 01:27:40,911
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

896
01:27:41,036 --> 01:27:43,872
and I bought a bus ticket,
and three Dr Peppers.

897
01:27:43,997 --> 01:27:48,460
Tell me something.
Are you stupid or something?

898
01:27:48,585 --> 01:27:51,129
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

899
01:27:51,254 --> 01:27:53,090
That's what's left after me saying,

900
01:27:53,215 --> 01:27:57,135
"When I was in China
on the All-America ping-pong team,

901
01:27:57,260 --> 01:27:59,096
"l just loved playing ping-pong

902
01:27:59,221 --> 01:28:01,348
"with my Flex-o-lite
ping-pong paddle,"

903
01:28:01,473 --> 01:28:03,475
which everybody knows isn't true,

904
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,646
but Mama said it was just a little
white lie, it wasn't hurting nobody.

905
01:28:07,771 --> 01:28:11,942
So anyway,
I'm putting all that on gas, ropes,

906
01:28:12,067 --> 01:28:16,196
and new nets
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

907
01:28:37,509 --> 01:28:40,804
Bubba told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

908
01:28:40,929 --> 01:28:43,807
but you know what I found out?

909
01:28:44,933 --> 01:28:47,602
Shrimping is tough.

910
01:28:49,521 --> 01:28:52,190
I only caught five.

911
01:28:52,274 --> 01:28:55,736
A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.

912
01:28:57,487 --> 01:29:00,407
You ever think about
naming this old boat?

913
01:29:00,532 --> 01:29:03,368
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

914
01:29:03,493 --> 01:29:05,787
I'd never named a boat before,

915
01:29:05,912 --> 01:29:10,917
but there was only one
I could think of,

916
01:29:11,043 --> 01:29:14,963
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

917
01:29:36,151 --> 01:29:41,907
I hadn't heard from Jenny in a long
while, but I thought about her a lot.

918
01:29:42,032 --> 01:29:44,910
I hoped whatever she was doing
made her happy.

919
01:31:31,099 --> 01:31:34,394
I thought about Jenny all the time.

920
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:28,031
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

921
01:32:28,156 --> 01:32:31,243
Well, thought I'd try out
my sea legs.

922
01:32:31,368 --> 01:32:34,371
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

923
01:32:34,496 --> 01:32:40,085
Yes, I know that.
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

924
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:45,549
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

925
01:32:46,925 --> 01:32:52,848
And I told you if you were
ever a shrimp boat captain,

926
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:56,393
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

927
01:32:56,518 --> 01:32:59,521
- I'm a man of my word.
- OK.

928
01:32:59,646 --> 01:33:03,608
But don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "Sir."

929
01:33:03,734 --> 01:33:05,861
No, sir.

930
01:33:13,994 --> 01:33:16,121
That's my boat.

931
01:33:18,665 --> 01:33:22,669
I have a feeling if we head due east,

932
01:33:22,794 --> 01:33:26,381
we'll find some shrimp.
So take a left.

933
01:33:27,883 --> 01:33:30,135
- Take a left!
- Which way?

934
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:32,763
Over there! They're over there!

935
01:33:32,888 --> 01:33:37,684
- Get on the wheel and take a left.
- OK.

936
01:33:39,102 --> 01:33:43,482
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

937
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:49,404
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

938
01:33:50,364 --> 01:33:52,324
That's where we'll find them.

939
01:34:04,962 --> 01:34:08,840
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- OK, so I was wrong.

940
01:34:08,966 --> 01:34:11,843
How are we going to find them?

941
01:34:11,969 --> 01:34:15,722
Maybe you should
Just pray for shrimp.

942
01:34:22,145 --> 01:34:24,648
So I went to church every Sunday.

943
01:34:26,191 --> 01:34:31,905
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came too,
though he left the praying up to me.

944
01:34:46,628 --> 01:34:51,967
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

945
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:57,055
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then God showed up.

946
01:35:14,031 --> 01:35:16,491
You'll never sink this boat!

947
01:35:16,617 --> 01:35:22,706
Now, me, I was scared,
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

948
01:35:22,831 --> 01:35:25,208
Come on!

949
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:33,050
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

950
01:35:34,926 --> 01:35:42,392
It's time for a showdown! You and me!
I'm right here! Come and get me!

951
01:35:44,686 --> 01:35:48,440
You'll never sink this boat!

952
01:35:50,734 --> 01:35:52,736
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

953
01:35:52,861 --> 01:35:54,988
destroying nearly everything
in its path.

954
01:35:55,113 --> 01:35:57,991
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

955
01:35:58,116 --> 01:36:00,619
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

956
01:36:00,744 --> 01:36:05,916
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.

957
01:36:06,041 --> 01:36:07,584
This reporter has learned,

958
01:36:07,709 --> 01:36:11,505
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.

959
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:14,049
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

960
01:36:14,174 --> 01:36:17,219
After that, shrimping was easy.

961
01:36:23,058 --> 01:36:26,019
Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails

962
01:36:26,144 --> 01:36:30,440
and barbecues and all, and we were
the only boat left standing,

963
01:36:30,565 --> 01:36:35,904
Bubba-Gump shrimp's what they got.
We got a whole bunch of boats.

964
01:36:36,029 --> 01:36:38,073
Twelve Jennys, big old warehouse.

965
01:36:38,198 --> 01:36:42,452
We even have hats
that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

966
01:36:42,577 --> 01:36:45,163
Bubba-Gump Shrimp. A household name.

967
01:36:45,289 --> 01:36:46,999
Hold on there, boy.

968
01:36:47,124 --> 01:36:51,795
Are you telling me you're the owner
of the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

969
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,798
Yes. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

970
01:36:54,923 --> 01:37:00,137
Boy, I heard some whoppers
in my time, but that tops them all.

971
01:37:02,764 --> 01:37:06,226
We were sitting
next to a millionaire.

972
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:14,318
Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,

973
01:37:14,443 --> 01:37:19,531
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

974
01:37:19,656 --> 01:37:23,619
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

975
01:37:23,744 --> 01:37:26,038
Yes, I would.

976
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:32,169
That's him right there.

977
01:37:34,296 --> 01:37:37,174
Let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan.

978
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:48,143
I never thanked you
for saving my life.

979
01:38:13,877 --> 01:38:20,133
He never actually said so, but
I think he made his peace with God.

980
01:38:28,016 --> 01:38:29,810
For the second time in 17 days,

981
01:38:29,935 --> 01:38:33,480
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

982
01:38:33,605 --> 01:38:38,193
- Base to Jenny 1. Base to Jenny 1.
- Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

983
01:38:38,318 --> 01:38:40,195
Forrest has a phone call.

984
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,781
Well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

985
01:38:42,906 --> 01:38:47,411
- He is indisposed at the moment.
- His mama's sick.

986
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:09,308
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

987
01:39:11,393 --> 01:39:13,520
Hi, Forrest.

988
01:39:13,645 --> 01:39:17,190
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

989
01:39:23,697 --> 01:39:27,326
Sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

990
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:42,924
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

991
01:39:45,385 --> 01:39:48,263
Come on in, sit down over here.

992
01:40:01,902 --> 01:40:08,492
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time. It's just my time.

993
01:40:10,410 --> 01:40:14,581
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

994
01:40:16,375 --> 01:40:21,505
Death is just a part of life.
Something we're all destined to do.

995
01:40:22,756 --> 01:40:28,011
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

996
01:40:28,136 --> 01:40:32,766
- I did the best I could.
- You did good.

997
01:40:32,891 --> 01:40:38,772
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

998
01:40:39,272 --> 01:40:43,819
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

999
01:40:47,322 --> 01:40:49,908
What's my destiny, Mama?

1000
01:40:50,033 --> 01:40:54,454
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1001
01:40:55,831 --> 01:40:58,750
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1002
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:01,712
You never know
what you're going to get.

1003
01:41:01,837 --> 01:41:06,049
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

1004
01:41:06,174 --> 01:41:08,176
I will miss you, Forrest.

1005
01:41:09,886 --> 01:41:14,141
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.

1006
01:41:14,266 --> 01:41:18,937
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.

1007
01:41:22,065 --> 01:41:25,152
And that's all
I have to say about that.

1008
01:41:31,867 --> 01:41:34,703
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1009
01:41:34,828 --> 01:41:37,998
There'll be another one
along shortly.

1010
01:41:40,917 --> 01:41:45,339
Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero

1011
01:41:45,464 --> 01:41:48,383
and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain

1012
01:41:48,508 --> 01:41:52,346
and a college graduate, the city
fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,

1013
01:41:52,471 --> 01:41:55,140
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1014
01:41:56,808 --> 01:41:59,978
So I never went back
to work for Lieutenant Dan,

1015
01:42:00,103 --> 01:42:02,856
though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

1016
01:42:02,981 --> 01:42:07,361
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1017
01:42:07,486 --> 01:42:11,114
I got a call from him saying we don't
have to worry about money no more,

1018
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:15,577
and I said,
"That's good. One less thing."

1019
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:21,667
Now Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,

1020
01:42:21,792 --> 01:42:25,128
and the rest is just for showing off.

1021
01:42:25,253 --> 01:42:30,759
So I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare Gospel Church.

1022
01:42:31,551 --> 01:42:36,556
And I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

1023
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:43,897
And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1024
01:42:44,022 --> 01:42:47,818
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1025
01:42:50,195 --> 01:42:51,822
You know what?

1026
01:42:51,947 --> 01:42:55,909
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1027
01:42:56,034 --> 01:42:58,495
That smells wonderful.

1028
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:03,959
And 'cause I was a goZillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

1029
01:43:04,042 --> 01:43:06,169
I cut that grass for free.

1030
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,384
But at night-time
when there was nothing to do

1031
01:43:12,509 --> 01:43:17,514
and the house was all empty,
I'd always think of Jenny.

1032
01:44:21,495 --> 01:44:24,915
And then, she was there.

1033
01:44:57,990 --> 01:45:01,702
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1034
01:45:12,504 --> 01:45:15,549
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1035
01:45:15,674 --> 01:45:20,470
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1036
01:45:20,595 --> 01:45:24,516
or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed

1037
01:45:24,641 --> 01:45:29,229
and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.

1038
01:45:29,980 --> 01:45:32,149
It was wonderful having her home.

1039
01:45:32,274 --> 01:45:38,780
Every day we'd take a walk, and l'd
jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1040
01:45:38,905 --> 01:45:41,742
and she'd listen about
ping-ponging and shrimping

1041
01:45:41,867 --> 01:45:45,787
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.

1042
01:45:45,912 --> 01:45:49,291
Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.

1043
01:46:28,914 --> 01:46:31,750
How could you do this?

1044
01:47:08,912 --> 01:47:13,417
Sometimes I guess there
Just aren't enough rocks.

1045
01:47:13,542 --> 01:47:19,381
I never really knew
why she came back, but I didn't care.

1046
01:47:19,506 --> 01:47:24,219
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.

1047
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:29,766
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,

1048
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:36,565
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.

1049
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:38,692
They're just for running.

1050
01:47:42,446 --> 01:47:45,574
And she even showed me how to dance.

1051
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:59,546
Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...

1052
01:48:02,466 --> 01:48:05,761
and it was the happiest time
in my life.

1053
01:48:30,077 --> 01:48:34,081
You done watching it?
I'm going to bed.

1054
01:48:45,008 --> 01:48:47,302
Will you marry me?

1055
01:48:51,515 --> 01:48:54,893
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1056
01:48:57,521 --> 01:48:59,439
You would, Forrest.

1057
01:49:01,441 --> 01:49:03,652
But you won't marry me.

1058
01:49:05,612 --> 01:49:08,407
You don't want to marry me.

1059
01:49:11,535 --> 01:49:13,912
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1060
01:49:19,167 --> 01:49:25,048
I'm not a smart man,
but I know what love is.

1061
01:50:05,839 --> 01:50:08,759
Forrest, I do love you.

1062
01:51:00,894 --> 01:51:06,316
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

1063
01:52:36,949 --> 01:52:42,496
That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.

1064
01:52:42,955 --> 01:52:46,708
So I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there

1065
01:52:46,833 --> 01:52:49,503
I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.

1066
01:52:49,586 --> 01:52:52,381
President Carter,
suffering from heat exhaustion...

1067
01:52:52,506 --> 01:52:54,257
And when I got there,

1068
01:52:54,383 --> 01:52:58,512
I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

1069
01:52:58,637 --> 01:53:01,098
Now, thinking since I'd run this far,

1070
01:53:01,223 --> 01:53:05,018
maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

1071
01:53:05,143 --> 01:53:08,772
And that's what I did.
I ran clear across Alabama.

1072
01:53:08,897 --> 01:53:12,526
No particular reason.
I just kept on going.

1073
01:53:13,318 --> 01:53:15,362
I ran clear to the ocean.

1074
01:53:20,951 --> 01:53:25,038
And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1075
01:53:25,163 --> 01:53:28,333
might as well turn around,
just keep on going.

1076
01:53:31,878 --> 01:53:36,258
And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1077
01:53:38,385 --> 01:53:41,930
I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.

1078
01:53:42,055 --> 01:53:47,519
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.

1079
01:53:47,644 --> 01:53:53,233
When I had to go...
you know... I went.

1080
01:53:53,817 --> 01:53:59,239
- And so, you just ran.
- Yeah.

1081
01:54:35,067 --> 01:54:40,906
I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1082
01:54:41,031 --> 01:54:47,204
But most of all, I thought about
Jenny. I thought about her a lot.

1083
01:54:48,914 --> 01:54:52,584
For more than two years,
a man named Forrest Gump,

1084
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:55,379
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,

1085
01:54:55,462 --> 01:54:59,841
has been running across America.
Charles Cooper reports.

1086
01:54:59,967 --> 01:55:03,178
For the fourth time
on his journey across America,

1087
01:55:03,303 --> 01:55:08,058
Forrest Gump the gardener will cross
the Mississippi River again today.

1088
01:55:09,518 --> 01:55:13,021
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
- Why are you running?

1089
01:55:13,146 --> 01:55:16,650
- Are you doing this for world peace?
- For the homeless?

1090
01:55:16,775 --> 01:55:19,653
- Are you running for women's rights?
- The environment?

1091
01:55:19,778 --> 01:55:24,658
They couldn't believe somebody would
do all that running for no reason.

1092
01:55:24,783 --> 01:55:29,037
- Why are you doing this?
- I just felt like running.

1093
01:55:29,162 --> 01:55:30,706
I just felt like runnin'.

1094
01:55:31,999 --> 01:55:35,419
It's you.
I can't believe it's really you.

1095
01:55:35,544 --> 01:55:41,008
For some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1096
01:55:41,133 --> 01:55:43,510
It was like an alarm
went off in my head.

1097
01:55:43,635 --> 01:55:47,222
I said, "Here's a guy
that's got his act together.

1098
01:55:47,347 --> 01:55:51,226
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr Gump.

1099
01:55:51,351 --> 01:55:53,604
So I got company.

1100
01:55:55,188 --> 01:56:01,194
And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.

1101
01:56:03,405 --> 01:56:06,491
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1102
01:56:09,995 --> 01:56:11,997
I don't know anything about that,

1103
01:56:12,122 --> 01:56:16,627
but some of those people asked me
if I could help them out.

1104
01:56:16,752 --> 01:56:21,214
I was wondering if you might help me.
I'm in the bumper sticker business.

1105
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:24,801
I need a good slogan, and since
you've been so inspirational,

1106
01:56:24,926 --> 01:56:27,429
I thought
you might be able to help me...

1107
01:56:27,554 --> 01:56:31,683
Whoa, man! You just ran
through a big pile of dog shit!

1108
01:56:32,976 --> 01:56:36,980
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1109
01:56:37,105 --> 01:56:38,899
Sometimes.

1110
01:56:40,776 --> 01:56:44,237
And some years later, I heard
that that fella did come up

1111
01:56:44,363 --> 01:56:48,742
with a bumper sticker slogan
and made a lot of money off of it.

1112
01:56:48,867 --> 01:56:51,119
Another time, I was running along,

1113
01:56:51,244 --> 01:56:53,956
somebody who'd lost all his money
in the t-shirt business,

1114
01:56:54,081 --> 01:56:57,376
he wanted to put my face
on a t-shirt,

1115
01:56:57,501 --> 01:57:01,380
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.

1116
01:57:01,505 --> 01:57:05,008
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that colour anyway.

1117
01:57:09,179 --> 01:57:10,973
Have a nice day.

1118
01:57:12,808 --> 01:57:16,186
Some years later,
I found out that that man did come up

1119
01:57:16,311 --> 01:57:20,232
with an idea for a t-shirt.
He made a lot of money.

1120
01:57:22,776 --> 01:57:27,656
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.

1121
01:57:27,781 --> 01:57:34,288
Mama always said, "Put the past
behind you before you can move on."

1122
01:57:34,788 --> 01:57:38,667
And I think
that's what my running was all about.

1123
01:57:40,168 --> 01:57:46,425
I had run for three years,
two months, 14 days and 16 hours.

1124
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:04,401
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1125
01:58:16,163 --> 01:58:18,498
I'm pretty tired.

1126
01:58:20,876 --> 01:58:23,253
Think I'll go home now.

1127
01:58:40,771 --> 01:58:43,273
Now what are we supposed to do?

1128
01:58:44,566 --> 01:58:49,488
And just like that,
my runnin' days was over.

1129
01:58:49,613 --> 01:58:51,823
So I went home to Alabama.

1130
01:58:53,617 --> 01:58:57,913
Moments ago, at 2.25 p.m., as
President Reagan was leaving the...

1131
01:58:59,957 --> 01:59:03,919
..five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.

1132
01:59:04,044 --> 01:59:06,296
The President was shot
in the chest...

1133
01:59:06,421 --> 01:59:08,215
I picked up the mail.

1134
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:12,928
And one day, out of the blue clear
sky, I got a letter from Jenny

1135
01:59:13,053 --> 01:59:16,848
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1136
01:59:16,974 --> 01:59:19,017
and that's what I'm doing here.

1137
01:59:20,394 --> 01:59:22,437
She saw me on Tv, running.

1138
01:59:22,562 --> 01:59:26,942
I'm supposed to go on the number nine
bus to Richmond Street

1139
01:59:27,067 --> 01:59:33,907
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, apartment 4.

1140
01:59:34,032 --> 01:59:37,494
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1141
01:59:37,619 --> 01:59:42,624
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1142
01:59:43,625 --> 01:59:46,545
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1143
01:59:48,422 --> 01:59:50,841
It was nice talking to you.

1144
01:59:53,176 --> 01:59:55,554
I hope everything works out for you!

1145
02:00:07,024 --> 02:00:11,695
- How you doin'? Come in! Come in!
- I got your letter.

1146
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:17,784
- I was wondering about that.
- This your house?

1147
02:00:17,909 --> 02:00:20,954
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1148
02:00:21,079 --> 02:00:24,875
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1149
02:00:31,048 --> 02:00:34,384
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1150
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:42,559
I kept a scrapbook of your clippings,
and everything. There you are.

1151
02:00:44,436 --> 02:00:46,396
And this, I got you running.

1152
02:00:48,815 --> 02:00:53,528
I ran a long way. It's a long time.

1153
02:00:56,031 --> 02:00:58,116
And there...

1154
02:01:04,039 --> 02:01:07,626
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1155
02:01:10,003 --> 02:01:15,634
I just I want to apologise
for anything that I ever did to you

1156
02:01:15,759 --> 02:01:19,721
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1157
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:26,144
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

1158
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:29,314
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

1159
02:01:29,523 --> 02:01:32,943
Next week my schedule changes,
so I can...

1160
02:01:33,068 --> 02:01:35,320
No problem. Got to go.
I'm double-parked.

1161
02:01:35,445 --> 02:01:37,281
OK. Thanks.

1162
02:01:39,074 --> 02:01:42,911
This is my very good friend Mr Gump.
Can you say hi?

1163
02:01:43,036 --> 02:01:45,455
- Hello, Mr Gump.
- Hello.

1164
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:49,584
- Can I go watch Tv now?
- Yes. Just keep it low.

1165
02:01:51,837 --> 02:01:55,007
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1166
02:01:58,385 --> 02:02:02,180
- His name's Forrest.
- Like me!

1167
02:02:04,516 --> 02:02:09,354
- I named him after his daddy.
- He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1168
02:02:11,023 --> 02:02:13,442
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1169
02:02:30,167 --> 02:02:33,629
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.

1170
02:02:35,005 --> 02:02:40,886
There's nothing you need to do.
You didn't do anything wrong. OK?

1171
02:02:45,515 --> 02:02:47,309
Isn't he beautiful?

1172
02:02:48,644 --> 02:02:52,773
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1173
02:02:55,692 --> 02:02:57,486
But...

1174
02:03:00,656 --> 02:03:02,824
Is he smart? Can he...

1175
02:03:02,950 --> 02:03:07,496
He's very smart. He's one
of the smartest in his class.

1176
02:03:16,004 --> 02:03:18,757
Yeah, it's OK. Go talk to him.

1177
02:03:28,016 --> 02:03:31,561
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1178
02:03:54,042 --> 02:03:58,463
Forrest, I'm sick.

1179
02:04:01,049 --> 02:04:04,511
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1180
02:04:04,636 --> 02:04:09,891
I have some virus, and the doctors,
they don't know what it is,

1181
02:04:10,017 --> 02:04:13,145
and there isn't
anything they can do about it.

1182
02:04:18,025 --> 02:04:20,527
You could come home with me.

1183
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:28,160
You and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1184
02:04:31,622 --> 02:04:34,666
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1185
02:04:36,209 --> 02:04:38,962
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1186
02:04:44,301 --> 02:04:45,677
OK.

1187
02:04:47,429 --> 02:04:48,930
Please take your seats.

1188
02:04:52,434 --> 02:04:55,437
Forrest? It's time to start.

1189
02:05:14,247 --> 02:05:17,584
Hi. Your tie.

1190
02:05:30,555 --> 02:05:32,808
Lieutenant Dan.

1191
02:05:47,614 --> 02:05:51,618
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hello, Forrest.

1192
02:05:52,035 --> 02:05:55,831
You got new legs. New legs!

1193
02:05:57,165 --> 02:06:00,919
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1194
02:06:01,044 --> 02:06:05,340
Titanium alloy. It's what they use
on the space shuttle.

1195
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,762
Magic legs.

1196
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:17,102
This is my fiancee, Susan.

1197
02:06:19,605 --> 02:06:24,318
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1198
02:06:24,443 --> 02:06:31,617
- Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you finally.

1199
02:06:42,210 --> 02:06:46,256
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny
to be your wife?

1200
02:06:48,008 --> 02:06:52,137
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1201
02:06:53,805 --> 02:06:57,184
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1202
02:07:28,006 --> 02:07:30,926
- Hey.
- Hi.

1203
02:07:50,028 --> 02:07:52,614
Were you scared in vietnam?

1204
02:07:53,991 --> 02:07:58,495
Yes. Well, I don't know.

1205
02:07:59,663 --> 02:08:05,127
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.

1206
02:08:08,005 --> 02:08:09,923
And then it was nice.

1207
02:08:13,343 --> 02:08:17,806
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1208
02:08:17,931 --> 02:08:22,811
There was always
a million sparkles on the water.

1209
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:28,191
Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,

1210
02:08:28,317 --> 02:08:33,655
it looked like there were two skies
one on top of the other.

1211
02:08:35,324 --> 02:08:38,744
And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1212
02:08:41,747 --> 02:08:48,170
I couldn't tell where heaven stopped
and the earth began.

1213
02:08:49,630 --> 02:08:51,882
It was so beautiful.

1214
02:08:56,136 --> 02:08:59,014
I wish I could've been there
with you.

1215
02:09:02,309 --> 02:09:04,269
You were.

1216
02:09:14,446 --> 02:09:16,239
I love you.

1217
02:09:20,285 --> 02:09:23,413
You died on a Saturday morning.

1218
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:29,419
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1219
02:09:33,882 --> 02:09:39,596
And I had that house of your father's
bulldoZed to the ground.

1220
02:09:43,433 --> 02:09:50,607
Mama always said
that dyin' was a part of life.

1221
02:09:53,902 --> 02:09:56,113
I sure wish it wasn't.

1222
02:09:59,074 --> 02:10:03,245
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1223
02:10:06,290 --> 02:10:08,834
About to start school again soon,

1224
02:10:09,876 --> 02:10:14,172
and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner every day.

1225
02:10:16,049 --> 02:10:22,222
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1226
02:10:24,891 --> 02:10:30,981
Teaching him how to play ping-pong.
He's really good.

1227
02:10:31,106 --> 02:10:33,108
Forrest, you go.

1228
02:10:37,904 --> 02:10:40,073
We fish a lot.

1229
02:10:43,452 --> 02:10:47,247
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1230
02:10:49,666 --> 02:10:54,671
You'd be so proud of him. I am.

1231
02:10:56,089 --> 02:10:59,134
He wrote you a letter.

1232
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:02,804
And he says I can't read it.

1233
02:11:02,930 --> 02:11:06,934
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1234
02:11:29,706 --> 02:11:35,754
I don't know if mama was right
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1235
02:11:36,713 --> 02:11:43,553
I don't know if
we each have a destiny,

1236
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:50,435
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeZe.

1237
02:11:54,898 --> 02:11:59,861
But I think maybe it's both.

1238
02:12:04,700 --> 02:12:07,953
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1239
02:12:13,667 --> 02:12:15,585
But I miss you, Jenny.

1240
02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:26,722
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1241
02:13:01,673 --> 02:13:05,469
Here's your bus. OK.

1242
02:13:07,596 --> 02:13:09,556
I know this.

1243
02:13:09,681 --> 02:13:12,434
I'm gonna share that for
show-and-tell

1244
02:13:12,559 --> 02:13:15,270
because Grandma
used to read it to you.

1245
02:13:15,395 --> 02:13:17,397
My favourite book.

1246
02:13:24,613 --> 02:13:26,865
Here you go.

1247
02:13:33,914 --> 02:13:35,332
Don't...

1248
02:13:37,542 --> 02:13:42,714
- I want to tell you I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1249
02:13:42,839 --> 02:13:46,009
I'll be right here when you get back.

1250
02:13:50,555 --> 02:13:54,935
You understand this is
the bus to school, don't you?

1251
02:13:55,060 --> 02:13:59,856
Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
