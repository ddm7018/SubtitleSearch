Who's the kid?
A friend of mine.

458
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,729
I can't manage this team
under a one-year contract.

459
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,689
Well, sure you can.

460

No, I can't.

461
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,238
Okay. I gotta put a team
on the field.

462
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,908
After that, I'll take a good
long look at your contract.

463
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,370
Deal with the manager's contract,
then put a team on the field.

464
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,916
At this moment, if a grounder's hit
to first, nobody's there to stop it.

465

It's not easy doing what
I do under the cloud of
a one-year contract.

Okay, I understand that.

I've been there.
I know you have.

468
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:49,429
A one-year contract means
the same thing to a manager
as to a player.

469
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,765
There's not a lot of faith there.

of the season, nobody gives a shit.

GRADY: The what?

486
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,020

487
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,650
Damon's on-base, .324.
And Olmedo's was .291.

488

So what?

1811
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:32,682
I made one decision in my life
based on money.

1812
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:35,810
And I swore
I would never do it again.

1813
02:00:38,397 --> 02:00:40,440
You're not doing it
for the money.

1814
02:00:40,942 --> 02:00:43,443
No?
No.

1815
02:00:45,446 --> 02:00:47,989
You're doing it
for what the money says.

1816
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:53,119
And it says what it says to any
player that makes big money.

1817
02:00:53,788 --> 02:00:55,538
That they're worth it.

1818
02:01:04,006 --> 02:01:05,715
What a dump.

1819
02:01:09,887 --> 02:01:12,222
I really wanted to win here.

1820
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:18,812
I really did.

1821
02:01:21,315 --> 02:01:23,483
I think you won pretty big, Billy.

1822
02:01:24,318 --> 02:01:26,444
Pete, we lost.

1823
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:30,615
We lost.

1824
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:34,244
It's only been a few days.
Give yourself some time
to get over it.

1825
02:01:34,412 --> 02:01:37,747
Man, I don't
get over these things.

1826
02:01:37,915 --> 02:01:39,040
Ever.

1827
02:01:46,048 --> 02:01:49,718
Come with me to the video room.
I wanna show you something.

1828
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:54,764
No, man,
I'm not up for film right now.

1829
02:01:56,017 --> 02:01:58,101
Come on. Seriously.

1830
02:01:58,269 --> 02:02:00,437
Come on, Billy.
Come on.

1831
02:02:02,148 --> 02:02:03,273
PETER:
The Visalia Oaks

1832
02:02:03,441 --> 02:02:06,234
and our 240-pound catcher,
Jeremy Brown,

1833
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:10,030
who, as you know,
is scared to run to second base.

1834
02:02:10,197 --> 02:02:11,990
This was in a game six weeks ago.

1835
02:02:12,575 --> 02:02:14,701
This guy's gonna start
with a fastball.

1836
02:02:14,869 --> 02:02:17,287
Jeremy's gonna take him
to deep center.

1837
02:02:19,457 --> 02:02:20,957
Here's what's interesting,

1838
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:24,002
because Jeremy's gonna do
what he never does.

1839
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,462
He's gonna go for it.

1840
02:02:25,629 --> 02:02:28,882
He's gonna round first
and he's gonna go for it.

1841
02:02:30,092 --> 02:02:31,384
Okay?

1842
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:39,642
This is all of Jeremy's
nightmares coming to life.

1843
02:02:42,104 --> 02:02:45,523
Aw, they're laughing at him.
And Jeremy's about to find out why.

1844
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:51,071
Jeremy's about to realize

1845
02:02:52,531 --> 02:02:55,658
that the ball went 60 feet
over the fence.

1846
02:02:58,287 --> 02:03:01,915
He hit a home run
and didn't even realize it.

1847
02:03:31,904 --> 02:03:34,948
How can you not be romantic
about baseball?

1848
02:03:39,870 --> 02:03:42,789
It's a metaphor.
I know it's a metaphor.

1849
02:03:47,503 --> 02:03:48,878
Okay.

1850
02:03:52,967 --> 02:03:56,010
Pete, you're a good egg.

1851
02:03:59,432 --> 02:04:01,182
I'll call you.
