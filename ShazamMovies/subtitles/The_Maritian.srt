NASA -  ARES III - LANDING SITE

00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:05,499
Alright team,
stay in sight of each other.

7
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:08,104
Let's make NASA proud today.

8
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,627
How's it looking over there, Watney?

9
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,894
Well, you'll be happy
to hear that in

10
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,938
grid section 14 to 28,
the particles were phenomenally coarse,

11
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:20,260
and on 29, they're....
they're much finer,

12
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,498
which should be ideal
for chemical analysis.

13
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:24,027
Oh, wow.
Did everybody hear that?

14
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:27,137
Mark just discovered dirt.
Should we alert the media?

15
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:28,805
It's alright.
What're you doing today, Martinez?

16
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,925
Making sure that the MAV
is still upright.

17
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:33,229
Well, I like you know that
visual inspection of the equipment

18
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,002
is imperative to mission success.

19
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:38,315
I also like to report
that the MAV is still upright.

20
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,496
Watney, you're keep leaving
your channel open,

21
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,610
which leads to Martinez responding,

22
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:45,726
which leads to all our listening,
which leads to me being annoyed.

23
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:48,622
Roger that.   Martinez, the captain
would like you to please...

24
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:50,621
shut your smart mouth.

25
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:54,344
We prefer to use a different adjective
to describe Martinez's mouth.

26
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:58,380
- Oh, did Beck just insult me?
- Dr. Beck, and, yes.

27
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,895
I'll be happy to turn the radios off
from here, commander.

28
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:02,332
Just say the word.

29
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:05,011
Hey, Johanssen.
Constant communication is the whole...

30
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:06,758
Shut him off.

31
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:11,862
Apologise for my countrymen, Vogel.

32
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:15,302
Accepted. How many samples
do we need, commander.

33
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:18,362
7,
a hundred grams each.

We have a mission update.
Storm warning.

36
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,248
Commander, you should come inside.
You're going to want to see this.

37
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:31,481
- What is it?
- Storm warning.

38
00:03:31,506 --> 00:03:35,286
I saw that in this morning's briefing.
We'll be inside before it hits.

39
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:38,059
Yeah.
They-They upgraded their estimate.

40
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,423
The storm is going
to be a lot worse.

41
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,732
Martinez, how's it look?

42
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:50,970
Not good.

43
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:56,312
1200 km in diameter
bearing 24.41 degrees

44
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,813
That's trekking right towards us.

45
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:02,566
Base on current estimation,
estimated force of 8600 Newtons.

46
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:06,123
- What's the abort force.
- 7500.

47
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:08,955
Anything more than that
and the MAV will tip.

48
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,219
- Do we scrub.
- Begin abort procedure.

49
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:16,557
We are estimating where the marginal error
would be... could we wait it out?

50
00:04:16,582 --> 00:04:18,532
Let's wait it out.

51
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:21,544
Let's wait it out.

52
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,318
Commander.

53
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,554
Prep emergency departure.

54
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:29,969
- Commander.
- We're scrubbed, that's an order.

55
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,503
Martinez, how long before take off?

56
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,271
10 minutes.

57
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,762
Visibility is almost zero.

58
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:51,423
Anyone gets lost,
home in on my suit's telemetry.

59
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:53,710
- You ready?
- Ready!

60
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,595
- Commander, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

61
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:26,539
Commander, we're at 10 degrees,
and the MAV's going to tip at 12.3

62
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:30,052
Hey! We might be able to
keep the MAV from tipping.

63
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:31,340
How?

64
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,366
Use the cables from
the solar farm as guylines!

65
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,581
Anchor it with a Rover!

66
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,018
Watch out!

67
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,748

71
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,069
Watney, report.

72
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:51,771
Before we lose telemetry,
his decompression alarm went off.

73
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:53,559
- Johanssen, where did you last see him?
- He's offline.

74
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,825
- I can't, I don't know where he is.
- What are the vitals on his suit.

75
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,152
- He's offline. He's offline.
- Negative. Complete lost of signal on Watney.

76
00:05:58,177 --> 00:05:59,295
- Mitch?
- Yeah.

77
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,729
How long can he
survive decompression?

78
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:03,416
Less than a minute.

79
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:05,983
Line up.
Walk west.

80
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:08,792
He maybe prone,
we don't want to step over him.

81
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:15,501
Commander, we're at
10.5 degrees, tilting to 11.

82
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,159
We got a gust of wind.

83
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:18,405
Copy that.

84
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,599
Everyone, home in on Martinez's suit.

85
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:23,461
It'll get you to the airlock.
Get in, prep for launch.

86
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:24,783
What about you, commander?

87
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:26,954
I'm going to search a little longer.

88
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:29,931
Keep moving.
Go!

89
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:36,063
Watney.
Watney, report.

90
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:39,971
The MAV is at 11.6 degrees.
Once good gust and we're tipping.

91
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:41,785
If it tips, you launch.

92
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,419
You really think I'm
going to leave you behind?

93
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,692
That's an order, Martinez.

94
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:47,165
Mark!

95
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:50,928
Mark.
Can you hear me?

96
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,708
Martinez, what about the proximity radar?

97
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,731
Could that detect,
Watney's suit.

98
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:58,563
Uh. It's made to see
the Hermes in orbit,

99
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:00,648
not a little piece of metal
put in a single suit.

100
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:02,201
- Give it a try.
- Roger.

101
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:05,425
What is she thinking? She knows the
infrared can't get through a sand storm.

102
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,375
She is grasping for anything.

103
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,011
We got negative contact
on the proximity radar.

104
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:11,642
- Nothing?
- Nah.

105
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,485
I can barely see the Hab.

106
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,434
Commander, I know you
don't want to hear this but...

107
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,425
Mark is dead.

108
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:20,628

00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:23,059
Hey. What the hell is
wrong with you, man?

110
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:25,449
My friend just died, I don't want
my commander to die too.

At around 4:30 AM,
central standard time,

131
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,728
our satellites detected a storm

132
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:21,704
approaching the Ares 3
mission site on Mars.

133
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:25,153
At 6:45, the storm has
escalated to severe

134
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:28,249
and we have no choice
but to abort the mission.

135

Thanks to the quick action
of Captain Lewis,

astronaut Beck, Johanssen,
Martinez and Vogel

137
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,088
were all able to reach
the Mars ascend vehicle.

138
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:41,842
And performed an emergency launch
at 7:28 central time.

Unfortunately during the evacuation,

struck by debris and killed.

141
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,698
Commander Lewis and the rest of her team
were able to intercept safety

142
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:56,624
with the Hermes and
now are heading home.

143

00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:10,685
I'm alive.

159
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,544
Obviously.
But...

160
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:18,235
I'm guessing that's going to come as a
surprise to my crew mates and to NASA.

161
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:22,023
And to the entire world, really.
So...

162
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:26,574
Surprise.

163
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:31,430
I did not die on Sol 18 and
best I can figure.

164
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:35,421
This length of our primary
communication antenna broke off

165
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:37,584
and threw it through my bio-monitor.

166
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:40,474
and ripped a hole in me as well.

167
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:44,020
But the antenna
and the blood really

168
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,756
managed to seal the breach
in my suit which kept me alive,

169
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,591
even though the crew must
have thought I was dead.

170
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:53,614
I have no way to contact NASA.

171
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,936
And even if I could,
it's going to be...

172
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:59,826
4 years until a manned mission
can reach me.

173
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,411
And I'm in a Hab
designed to last 31 days.

174
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:04,774
If the oxygenator breaks,
I'm going to suffocate.

175
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,328
If the water reclaimer breaks,
I'll die of thirst.

176
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:11,487
If the Hab breaches,
I'm just kind of... implode.

177
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,357
And if by some miracle
none of that happens,

178
00:17:15,754 --> 00:17:18,059
eventually I'm going to
run out of food.

[SOL 21]

191
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,464
Our service mission here
was suppose to last

192
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,651
for 31 Sols. For redundancy
they sent 68 Sols worth of food,

193
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,059
that's for 6 people.

194
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:04,642
So for just me,
that's going to last 300 Sols.

195
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:08,037
Which I figure I could stretch
to 400 if I ration. So...

The problem is water.

215
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:47,087
I have created
126 square meters of soil.

216
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:50,816
And every cubic meter of soil
requires 48 liters of water

to be farm with.

218
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,032
So, I'm got to make
a lot more water.

219
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:58,573
Good thing is that I know the recipe.

220
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:01,617
- You take hydrogen, you add oxygen,
you burn them.
[ SOL 37 ]

221
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,575
Now, I have hundreds of liters
of unused hydrazine at the MDV.

222
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,523
I run the hydrazine
around an iridium catalyst

223
00:25:10,548 --> 00:25:13,196
It will separate into N2 and H2.

224
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:19,685
And if I just direct the hydrogen
into a small area and burn it,

225
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:22,949
likely remake history of humanity.

226
00:25:22,974 --> 00:25:28,275
Nothing bad has ever happened
from lighting hydrogen on fire.

227
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,095
NASA hates fire

228
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,385
because of the whole, fire makes
everybody die in space thing.

tell them to keep working.

According to the logs,
Command Lewis took it out, Sol 17,

332
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,980
plugged it into the Hab to recharge.

It's been moved.

to log the move.

No.
Not likely.

Why don't we just ask Lewis.

ask her directly right now.

need to be alert and undistracted.

But, they already think he's dead.

344

And they'd be devastated to
find out they left him there alive.

thought this through.

The next NASA mission is ARES 4

384
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,368
I'll have to be there.

Okay, so here's the rub.

00:35:26,577 --> 00:35:31,508
I've got 1 working Rover, designed
to go a max distance 35 km.

recharge at the Hab.

That's problem A.

Problem B, is this journey is going to
take me roughly 50 days to complete.

391
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:47,097
So, I got to live for 50 days

But, if I use the heater,

00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,548
I will burn through half
of my battery every day.

00:36:58,812 --> 00:37:02,846
I would love to solve
this problem right now, but...

00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:06,866
unfortunately,
my balls are frozen.

Good news, I may have a solution
to my heating problem.

407
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:31,707
Bad news, it involves me digging up the
radioisotope thermoelectric generator.

408
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:35,772
Now, if I remember my training correctly,
One of the lessons was titled:

409
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:39,017
Don't dig up the big box
of plutonium, Mark.

410
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:43,455
I get it, RTGs are good for spacecraft,
But if they rupture around humans,

411
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,601
no more gamelies.

412
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:46,995
Which is why buried it
when we arrived.

413
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,367
And planted that flag,

414
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:52,201
so we can never be stupid enough
to accidentally go near it again.

think about the fact that I'm...

Problem is he's not
taking a direct route.

627
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:10,760
Oh, my God.

628
00:56:12,433 --> 00:56:15,967
Yes, sir. He's under a
tremendous amount of stress.

629
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:19,058
I understand.
We're working on it.

630
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,044
I'm sure he didn't mean
what he said.

631
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:23,136
Thank you, Mr. President.

632
00:56:24,564 --> 00:56:25,939
Problem is, Mark's right.

633
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,395
The longer we wait,
The worse it's going to get.

634
00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:29,771
We need to tell the crew.

635
00:56:29,772 --> 00:56:32,345
You're bringing this up while
Vincent is in Pasadena

636
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:33,845
so he can't argue the other side.

637
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,859
I shouldn't have to
answer to Vincent.

638
00:56:35,884 --> 00:56:37,728
Or anyone else.

639
00:56:39,536 --> 00:56:41,515
It's time, Teddy.

640
00:56:44,466 --> 00:56:49,255
THE HERMES
4 MONTHS SINCE MARS DEPARTURE

641
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:06,733
Captain Lewis?

642
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:08,457
Go ahead.

643
00:57:08,743 --> 00:57:11,220
Data dump is almost complete.

644
00:57:11,245 --> 00:57:13,684
Copy that.
On my way.

645
00:57:26,324 --> 00:57:27,758
You're in a hurry.

646
00:57:27,783 --> 00:57:31,155
Yeah.
My son turned 3 yesterday.

647
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,490
Should be pictures of the party.

648
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:48,730
Got a batch of personals.
Dispatching them to your laptop now.

649
00:57:48,755 --> 00:57:52,330
I don't mean to read, Vogel,
weird German fetish e-mails.

650
00:57:52,356 --> 00:57:53,886
They're telemetry updates.

651
00:57:53,911 --> 00:57:55,810
Hey, whatever does it for you, man.

652
00:57:55,835 --> 00:57:56,937
TO : ALL CREW
VIDEO FILE : RECEIVED

653
00:57:56,962 --> 00:58:00,725
Oh, there's a video message.
It's-It's address to the whole crew.

654
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,187
Play it.
Come on, guys.

655
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:06,159
I want to get in on that
that telemetry action.

656
00:58:08,855 --> 00:58:12,331
Hi, hello.
It's Mitch, Mitch Henderson.

657
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:14,262
I have some news.

658
00:58:14,287 --> 00:58:17,320
There's no subtle way to put this.

659
00:58:17,566 --> 00:58:19,422
Mark Watney is still alive.

660
00:58:19,447 --> 00:58:21,273
Oh my God.

661
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:25,623
I know that's a surprise,
I know you'll have lots of questions,

662
00:58:25,648 --> 00:58:27,339
But here are the basics.

663
00:58:27,364 --> 00:58:31,035
He's alive and
he's healthy.

664
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:36,029
We... We found out 2 months ago
and... decided not to tell you.

665
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,136
- What?
- 2 months?

666
00:58:37,161 --> 00:58:38,242
Oh my god.

667
00:58:38,267 --> 00:58:40,611
I was strongly against that decision.

668
00:58:40,636 --> 00:58:43,565
We are telling you now, because...

669
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:46,288
we finally have communication with him.

670
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:49,029
and a viable rescue plan.

671
00:58:49,376 --> 00:58:53,217
We'll get you a write up of what happened.
A full write up of everything.

672
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:54,905
But it's not your fault.

673
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:58,288
Mark stresses that
everytime it comes up.

674
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:01,501
So...
Yeah.

675
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:05,663
Take some time to absorb this.

676
00:59:05,693 --> 00:59:10,245
And... send all the questions
you want, we'll answer.

677
00:59:11,272 --> 00:59:13,088
Alright, Henderson out.

678
00:59:13,113 --> 00:59:15,324
Holy shit.
He's alive.

679
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,971
I left him behind.

680
00:59:16,996 --> 00:59:18,093
- No.
- No.

681
00:59:18,118 --> 00:59:20,034
We all left together.

682
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:22,463
You were following orders.

683
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:27,676
I left him behind.

684
00:59:35,146 --> 00:59:36,930
SOL 128

685
00:59:36,955 --> 00:59:40,079
So, now that NASA can talk to me,
they won't shut up.

686
00:59:40,104 --> 00:59:43,063
They want constant updates
on every Hab system,

687
00:59:43,088 --> 00:59:46,951
and they've a room full of people
trying to micromanage my crops.

688
00:59:46,976 --> 00:59:49,069
Which is awesome.

689
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,233
Look, I mean, I don't mean
to sound arrogant or anything,

690
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:56,890
But I am the greatest botanist
on this planet, so...

691
00:59:57,529 --> 01:00:00,831
Oh, one big bonus to this
communication with NASA again

692
01:00:00,856 --> 01:00:02,342
is the e-mail,
I'm getting them again.

693
01:00:02,367 --> 01:00:04,992
A big data dump.
It's like when I was on the Hermes.

694
01:00:05,017 --> 01:00:06,788
I even got one
from the President.

695
01:00:06,813 --> 01:00:09,467
The coolest one now.
The coolest one I got

696
01:00:09,468 --> 01:00:12,579
was from the University of Chicago,
where I Alma mater.

697
01:00:12,604 --> 01:00:15,271
They said that,
once you grow crops somewhere,

698
01:00:15,296 --> 01:00:18,000
You officially "colonized" it.

699
01:00:18,001 --> 01:00:20,940
So, technically,

700
01:00:21,428 --> 01:00:23,749
I colonized Mars.

701
01:00:27,648 --> 01:00:30,357
In your face, Neil Armstrong.

702
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:32,455
Oh, another news.
There's been a request

703
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,748
for me to post for a photograph
on my next transmission.

704
01:00:37,194 --> 01:00:41,567
I am trying to figure out whether
I should go with high school senior,

705
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,864
or ingenue.

706
01:00:44,914 --> 01:00:49,954
But, I'm not really sure how it's
going to look with my spacesuit on.

707
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:17,546
Yeahhh.

708
01:01:19,151 --> 01:01:20,451
What's he doing?

709
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:23,047
I ask for a photo,
and what, he's the the Fonz?

710
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:24,939
Just be grateful we got
you something, Annie.

711
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,893
I can't use this, Vincent,
and you know that.

712
01:01:26,918 --> 01:01:28,495
I need a picture of his face.

713
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,961
Well, I can tell him
to take off his helmet,

714
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:32,104
But then he,
you know, die.

715
01:01:32,129 --> 01:01:33,284
So.

716
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:35,952
We'll release the photo and
we'll detail the rescue operation.

717
01:01:35,977 --> 01:01:39,007
I want to announce we're launching
some supplies to him next year

718
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,063
during the Hohmann Transfer Window.

719
01:01:41,088 --> 01:01:43,123
Bruce, your team still on schedule?

720
01:01:43,148 --> 01:01:45,363
It will be tight, but
we'll make it.

721
01:01:45,388 --> 01:01:49,766
9 months travel time, that puts
the probe to Mars on Sol 868.

722
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:51,563
Did we get the
Botany team's analysis?

723
01:01:51,588 --> 01:01:55,191
Yeah. They estimate
Mark's crops will last till Sol 912.

724
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:57,965
They grudgingly admit that
he's-he's doing a great work.

725
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:59,071
Grudgingly?

726
01:01:59,072 --> 01:02:01,292
Well, yeah. Mark has the tendency to tell
them to have sex with themselves

727
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,540
whenever they question one of his decisions.

728
01:02:03,565 --> 01:02:06,648
Get him online, Vincent.
We can't afford any miscommunication.

729
01:02:06,673 --> 01:02:07,904
I hate this margin.

730
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:12,319
912 Sols worth of food,
we get there in 868.

731
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:15,281
That's assuming nothing goes wrong.

Complete loss of pressure
boiled off most of the water.

748

Any bacteria that survived died
in the subzero temperatures

749

when exposed to Mar's atmosphere.

750
01:07:00,608 --> 01:07:02,671
How long has he have?

751
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:07,637
Oh. He can still eat the potatoes he has,
he just can't grow anymore, so...

752
01:07:07,779 --> 01:07:10,629
Give him... 200 Sols.

753
01:07:10,654 --> 01:07:14,318
Rations give him to what?
Sol 409?

754
01:07:14,343 --> 01:07:16,523
So, with potatoes, 609.

755
01:07:16,524 --> 01:07:19,315
So, by Sol 868,
he'll be long dead.

756
01:07:19,316 --> 01:07:21,355
We're going to have to launch
as soon as possible,

757
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,960
which changes our travel time.

758
01:07:24,228 --> 01:07:26,261
Yeah, we're working on it.

759
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,973
Preliminary estimates
call for a 414 day trip.

It's Sol 135 now.

761
01:07:33,608 --> 01:07:37,084
We need 13 days to mount
the boosters, perform inspections

762
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:40,539
which gives Bruce and his team

763
01:07:40,564 --> 01:07:43,607
47 days to make this probe.

764
01:07:44,221 --> 01:07:47,729
I'll let you call Bruce.
Give him the news.

765
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:52,238
Okay.

766
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:57,927
I'm...  I'm going to need
a change of clothes.

767
01:08:01,263 --> 01:08:04,418
SOL 136

768
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,988
Dear Mark,

769
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:13,484
Apparently,
NASA's letting us talk to you now.

770
01:08:14,254 --> 01:08:18,222
And I,
drew the short straw.

771
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:25,600
Sorry we left you behind on Mars,

772
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:28,759
but we just don't like you.

773
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:36,039
Also, it's a lot roomier
on the Hermes without you.

774
01:08:36,064 --> 01:08:39,999
We have to take turns
doing your tasks,

775
01:08:40,024 --> 01:08:44,203
but, I mean,
it's only botany.

776
01:08:44,847 --> 01:08:45,977
It's (not real science.)

777
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:48,002
Oh, Jesus.

778
01:08:49,301 --> 01:08:51,313
How's Mars?

779
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:59,663
Dear Martinez, Mars is fine.

780
01:08:59,688 --> 01:09:02,623
I accidentally blew up the Hab,

781
01:09:02,648 --> 01:09:09,871
but unfortunately all of Commander Lewis'
disco music still survived.

782
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:14,452
but unfortunately all of Commander Lewis'

784

787
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:32,352

799
01:12:33,232 --> 01:12:35,603
Sorry, but they're asking
for the probe courses.

800
01:12:35,628 --> 01:12:37,255
What time is it?

801
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,837
It's... 03:42

802
01:12:44,742 --> 01:12:47,079
I know we're coming
at this backwards,

803
01:12:47,104 --> 01:12:50,953
but we can't commit to a firm
launch date with so many unknowns.

804
01:12:51,356 --> 01:12:52,904
It's alright.

805
01:12:53,367 --> 01:12:56,163
All 25 models for launch will take
414 days to reach the Mars.

806
01:12:56,188 --> 01:12:57,954
They varies slightly in
thrust duration and

807
01:12:57,979 --> 01:13:00,585
fuel requirement isn't nearly as identical.

808
01:13:01,064 --> 01:13:03,063
Not a good time to launch, is it?

809
01:13:03,064 --> 01:13:06,225
Yeah. Earth and Mars
are really badly positioned.

810
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:08,872
Heck, it'd almost be easier if you...

811
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,925
Almost easier to what?

812
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,424
I need more coffee.

813
01:13:16,968 --> 01:13:19,597
- Are you alright?
- It's fine.

814
01:13:23,758 --> 01:13:25,926
Almost easier to what?

815
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:39,406
You do understand
I'm your boss, right?

816
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:41,125
Uh-huh.

817
01:13:44,731 --> 01:13:48,512
Let's ask the very very
expensive question.

818
01:13:48,775 --> 01:13:50,461
Is the probe going
to be ready on time?

819
01:13:50,486 --> 01:13:52,494
- We are behind.
- Give me a number.

820
01:13:52,519 --> 01:13:55,553
15 days.
15 days and I can get it done.

821
01:13:55,578 --> 01:13:58,939
Alright, let's create 15 days.
13 days to mount the probe.

822
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,271
Can we reduce?

823
01:14:00,296 --> 01:14:02,647
It actually takes 3 days
to mount the probe.

824
01:14:02,648 --> 01:14:04,592
And we can get it
down to 2, right?

825
01:14:04,617 --> 01:14:06,167
I can get it down to 2.

826
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:08,015
10 days are for
tests and inspections.

827
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,145
How often do those inspections
reveal a problem?

828
01:14:11,262 --> 01:14:13,431
Are you suggesting we
don't do the inspections?

829
01:14:13,456 --> 01:14:15,915
Right now, I'm asking how often
they reveal a problem?

830
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,143
1 in 20.

831
01:14:17,168 --> 01:14:18,831
But that's grounds
for countdown halt.

832
01:14:18,856 --> 01:14:20,063
We can't take that chance.

833
01:14:20,064 --> 01:14:23,315
Anyone else know a safer way
to buy more time?

834
01:14:26,871 --> 01:14:29,287
Dr. Keller, stretch Watney's
rations 4 more days.

835
01:14:29,312 --> 01:14:31,404
He's not going to like it,
but that will get us to 15.

836
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,395
- And we'll cancel the inspections.
-Teddy.

837
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,588
- Sir, If that ever got out.
- It's on me.

838
01:14:35,613 --> 01:14:36,971
You got your 2 weeks.

839
01:14:36,996 --> 01:14:38,831
Get it done!

840
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,537
So, now, I have to hold out until
the probe gets here with more food.

841
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:46,187
You want to see what
minimum calorie count looks like?

842
01:14:46,188 --> 01:14:47,895
Standard issue ration.

843
01:14:47,896 --> 01:14:51,955
But instead of 3 of these
every 1 day,

844
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:56,564
I'm now eating 1 of these
every 3 days.

845
01:14:57,224 --> 01:14:59,687
And now they've asked me...

846
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,724
to do that.

stretch the rations 4 more days.

850
01:15:12,725 --> 01:15:15,019
These are real dick punch.

01:15:16,499 --> 01:15:18,121

I'm going to dip this potato
in some crashed vitacarn.

01:15:22,891 --> 01:15:25,817
And there's nobody
who can stop me.

I may need you to do

If I die, I need you to

01:20:52,713 --> 01:20:55,866
Our data is classified information.

945
01:20:57,569 --> 01:20:59,294
That's to say.

946
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:01,431
If we do nothing...

947
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:06,505
The world will never knew,
actually we could have helped.

948
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:09,171
So.
For the sake of argument,

949
01:21:09,196 --> 01:21:11,736
let's say we decided to help them.

950
01:21:11,761 --> 01:21:16,600
We give them the boosters, that means the
cancellation of Taiyang Shen's program.

951
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:20,294
Then let us, from Aerospace point of view,
try to solve this problem.

952
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:22,279
Find a way to cooperate.

953
01:21:25,128 --> 01:21:26,616
Yes.

954
01:21:27,509 --> 01:21:29,777
Yes, I understand.

955
01:21:32,412 --> 01:21:33,920
Thank you.

956
01:21:37,296 --> 01:21:38,819
Yes!

957
01:21:39,664 --> 01:21:40,787
Alright!

958
01:21:40,788 --> 01:21:44,539
Thanks to my uncle Tommy in China,
We got another chance at this.

959
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:47,747
Now we finished
the Iris probe in 62 days,

960
01:21:47,748 --> 01:21:51,909
we're now going to
attempt to finish it in 28.

961
01:21:53,113 --> 01:21:57,463
PLEIADES
NASA ADVANCED SUPERCOMPUTER

962
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:06,215
CALCULATIONS
CORRECT

963
01:22:16,226 --> 01:22:18,163
We can jettison
any kind of landing systems.

964
01:22:18,188 --> 01:22:22,294
We're sending only rations.
We can crash land on Mars.

965
01:22:22,948 --> 01:22:24,420
You should hang up the phone.

966
01:22:24,456 --> 01:22:26,215
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- My name is Rich Purnell.

967
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,765
I work in Astrodynamics, and you
should hang up the phone, right now.

968
01:22:31,143 --> 01:22:32,797
Alright.
Alright.

969
01:22:32,983 --> 01:22:34,762
I'm going to call you back.

970
01:22:35,321 --> 01:22:37,547
I know how to save Mark Watney.

971
01:22:38,379 --> 01:22:40,971
Your probe plan won't work.
Too many things can go wrong.

972
01:22:40,996 --> 01:22:42,227
I got a better way.

973
01:22:42,252 --> 01:22:44,874
- Astrodynamics?
- Yeah.

974
01:22:45,148 --> 01:22:48,083
What the hell is Project Elrond?

975
01:22:48,108 --> 01:22:49,271
I had to make something up.

976
01:22:49,272 --> 01:22:51,123
Yeah, but, Elrond?

977
01:22:51,148 --> 01:22:53,315
Because it's a secret meeting.

978
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:56,004
How do you know that?
Why does Elrond mean secret meeting?

979
01:22:56,029 --> 01:22:58,747
The Council of Elrond.
It's from the "Lord Of The Rings."

980
01:22:58,748 --> 01:23:00,123
- It's the meeting where they
- The Lord Of The Rings.

981
01:23:00,148 --> 01:23:02,187
decide to destroy the One ring.

982
01:23:02,188 --> 01:23:04,023
If we are going to call
something Project Elrond,

983
01:23:04,024 --> 01:23:06,307
I would like my codename
to be Glorfindel.

984
01:23:06,308 --> 01:23:08,431
Okay.
I hate everyone of you.

985
01:23:08,456 --> 01:23:10,819
Wait, Teddy doesn't even
know about this yet?

986
01:23:10,844 --> 01:23:11,939
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

987
01:23:11,964 --> 01:23:15,163
This is Rich Purnell,
Astrodynamics.

988
01:23:15,188 --> 01:23:16,939
Tell them what you just told me.

989
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:20,789
I can get the Hermes
back to Mars by Sol 561.

990
01:23:21,807 --> 01:23:23,296
How?

991
01:23:27,046 --> 01:23:29,833
Would you stand right there
for me, please?

992
01:23:31,301 --> 01:23:33,656
Thanks.
Right there, great.

993
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:38,336
And could you, stand right there?
Right there.

994
01:23:42,256 --> 01:23:46,253
Okay. Let's pretend that this stapler
is the Hermes,

995
01:23:46,278 --> 01:23:48,855
And you are...

996
01:23:48,856 --> 01:23:50,231
I'm sorry.
What's your name again?

997
01:23:50,232 --> 01:23:53,908
Teddy.
I'm the director of NASA.

998
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:56,196
Cool.
Teddy, you're Earth.

999
01:23:56,208 --> 01:23:58,623
And right now, the Hermes
is heading towards you,

1000
01:23:58,648 --> 01:24:01,271
starting it's month long
deceleration intercept,

1001
01:24:01,272 --> 01:24:04,867
but instead,
what I'm proposing is,

1002
01:24:07,816 --> 01:24:11,914
It start accelerating immediately,
to preserve and gain even more.

1003
01:24:11,939 --> 01:24:14,629
We don't intercept with Earth at all,
but we come close enough...

1004
01:24:14,654 --> 01:24:16,955
to get a gravity assist
and adjust course.

1005
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:19,321
While we're doing that,

1006
01:24:21,024 --> 01:24:24,023
- we resupply with the probe.
- The Taiyang Shen.

1007
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:25,666
Pick up whatever
provisions we need.

1008
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:28,880
And now we accelerating towards Mars.

1009
01:24:30,554 --> 01:24:32,049
You're Mars.

1010
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:35,083
Now, we are going too fast
at this point to fall into orbit, but...

1011
01:24:35,108 --> 01:24:36,607
we can do a flyby.

1012
01:24:36,608 --> 01:24:39,721
What good is a flyby if you
can't get Watney off the surface?

1013
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:43,090
Watney would
intercept using  the MAV.

1014
01:24:43,115 --> 01:24:44,348
Ow.

1015
01:24:47,044 --> 01:24:48,871
And then they'll just head home.

1016
01:24:53,556 --> 01:24:56,783
I done the math.
It checks out.

1017
01:24:57,976 --> 01:24:59,415
- Rich.
- Yes, sir.

1018
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,892
- Get out.
- Alright.

1019
01:25:07,877 --> 01:25:09,871
- Is he right?
- Yep.

1020
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:12,415
Bruce, what do you think?

1021
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,736
Well, If Vincent say so.

1022
01:25:15,355 --> 01:25:18,871
- We need to use the Taiyang Shen?
- Uh-huh.

1023
01:25:18,896 --> 01:25:20,979
Wha-What am I missing?
Why is that important?

1024
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:22,238
Because we can only do one.

1025
01:25:22,263 --> 01:25:24,771
Send Watney enough food
to last till Ares 4,

1026
01:25:24,796 --> 01:25:26,679
or send Hermes back
to get him right now.

1027
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:30,904
Both plans require the Taiyang Shen.
So, we have to choose.

1028
01:25:30,905 --> 01:25:32,539
But, what about the Hermes' crew?

1029
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:37,526
It would be asking them, to add
533 extra days to their mission.

1030
01:25:37,527 --> 01:25:39,941
And they wouldn't hesitate,
not for a second.

1031
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:43,707
Can the Hermes function for 533 days
beyond the scheduled mission?

1032
01:25:43,732 --> 01:25:44,855
Should.

1033
01:25:44,866 --> 01:25:46,865
Built to last the full Ares mission.

1034
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:49,575
So, technically, it's only
half way through it's lifespan.

1035
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,264
- But, if something goes wrong.
- Then, we lose the crew.

1036
01:25:52,265 --> 01:25:56,454
So, what? We, either have a
high chance of killing 1 person, or

1037
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:58,979
low chance of killing 6 people.

1038
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,622
How do we make that decision?

1039
01:26:00,647 --> 01:26:02,697
We don't have to make it, Bruce.

1040
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:03,791
He does.

1041
01:26:03,816 --> 01:26:05,223
Yeah.
But, bullshit.

1042
01:26:05,224 --> 01:26:07,415
Should be Commander Lewis' call.

1043
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,606
We still have a chance to bring
5 astronauts home safe and sound.

1044
01:26:10,631 --> 01:26:13,420
I'm not risking their lives.

1045
01:26:13,445 --> 01:26:15,991
Let them make that decision.

1046
01:26:16,016 --> 01:26:19,541
Mitch, we're going with option 1.

1047
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,010
You god damn coward.

1048
01:26:40,732 --> 01:26:43,371
- Johanssen?
- Yeah.

1049
01:26:43,396 --> 01:26:46,063
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

1050
01:26:46,064 --> 01:26:47,187
Yeah, go ahead.

1051
01:26:47,188 --> 01:26:49,571
- Where are you?
- The gym.

1052
01:27:10,613 --> 01:27:11,738
What's up?

1053
01:27:11,763 --> 01:27:16,747
I just got an e-mail from my wife,
and the subject line says, "our children."

1054
01:27:16,772 --> 01:27:19,652
My computer won't open
the attachment.

1055
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:23,544
Okay.
Let's take a look.

1056
01:27:29,162 --> 01:27:31,004
Let's see.

1057
01:27:32,073 --> 01:27:34,347
This isn't a jpeg.

1058
01:27:35,049 --> 01:27:38,347
It's a-It's a plain ASCII text file.

1059
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:43,086
I don't really know what
we're looking at. It's...

1060
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:46,292
That make any sense to you?

1061
01:27:46,816 --> 01:27:49,147
Rich Purnell maneuver.

1062
01:27:49,148 --> 01:27:53,291
It's a course maneuver
for the Hermes.

1063
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,283
My god.

1064
01:27:57,487 --> 01:28:02,391
The mission concludes with
Earth intercept 211 days later.

1065
01:28:02,684 --> 01:28:04,267
Would it work?

1066
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:06,348
We ran the numbers.
They checked out.

1067
01:28:06,373 --> 01:28:08,205
It's a brilliant course.

1068
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:10,850
So, why all the cloak and dagger?

1069
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:13,023
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

1070
01:28:13,024 --> 01:28:17,315
Yeah. If we do the maneuver, they have
to send the supply ship or we die.

1071
01:28:17,316 --> 01:28:20,800
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

1072
01:28:21,813 --> 01:28:24,991
So, are we going to do?

1073
01:28:25,495 --> 01:28:27,555
If it's up to me,
we'll already be on our way.

1074
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:30,123
But it is, no, isn't it?
Up to you?

1075
01:28:30,124 --> 01:28:31,486
Not this time.

1076
01:28:31,511 --> 01:28:34,869
This is something NASA
expressly rejected.

1077
01:28:35,467 --> 01:28:38,714
We're talking about mutiny here,
which is not a word that I take lightly

1078
01:28:38,739 --> 01:28:41,545
So, we do this together,
or not at all.

1079
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:44,523
And, before you answer,
consider the consequences.

1080
01:28:44,524 --> 01:28:47,859
If we mess up the
supply rendezvous, we die.

1081
01:28:47,884 --> 01:28:50,599
If we mess up the
Earth gravity assist, we die.

1082
01:28:50,624 --> 01:28:52,844
If we do everything perfectly,

1083
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:57,172
We add 533 days to our mission.

1084
01:28:57,197 --> 01:29:01,473
533 more days,
before we see our families again.

1085
01:29:01,498 --> 01:29:07,603
533 days of unplanned space travel
where anything can go wrong.

1086
01:29:07,604 --> 01:29:11,791
If it's mission critical, we die.

1087
01:29:11,816 --> 01:29:12,934
Sign me up.

1088
01:29:12,959 --> 01:29:14,687
Alright, cowboy, slow down.

1089
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:16,424
You and I, we're military.

1090
01:29:16,449 --> 01:29:18,455
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

1091
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,504
- Oh yeah, there's that.
- And for the rest of you guys,

1092
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:23,563
I guarantee they will never
 send you back up here again.

1093
01:29:23,588 --> 01:29:28,123
Good. So, if we go for it,
how would it work?

1094
01:29:28,148 --> 01:29:29,906
I'll plot the course and execute it.

1095
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:31,315
Remote override.

1096
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:34,603
They can take over the Hermes
from Mission Control.

1097
01:29:35,064 --> 01:29:37,166
Can you disable it?

1098
01:29:37,191 --> 01:29:39,439
Hermes has 4 redundant
flight computers,

1099
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,984
each connected to
3 redundant comm systems.

1100
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:44,878
We can't shut down the comms,
because we'll lose telemetry and guidance.

1101
01:29:44,903 --> 01:29:48,373
And we can't shut down the computers,
because we need to run the ship.

1102
01:29:48,398 --> 01:29:51,769
I'll have to disable remote override
on each system.

1103
01:29:51,794 --> 01:29:53,924
It's part of the OS,
I have to jump over the code.

1104
01:29:53,949 --> 01:29:57,159
Okay, but like in English,
like what would that mean?

1105
01:29:58,839 --> 01:30:00,570
I can do it.

1106
01:30:01,057 --> 01:30:02,511
Great.

1107
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:05,891
But, it has to be unanimous.

1108
01:30:05,916 --> 01:30:11,133
If we do this, it will be
over 900 days of space.

1109
01:30:12,916 --> 01:30:16,889
It's more than enough space
for 1 life, so...

1110
01:30:17,416 --> 01:30:18,756
Yes.

1111
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:20,497

Roger, read it out.

1118
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,845

'Houston, please be advised:

1119
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:42,209

steely-eyed missile man.'

01:30:45,093 --> 01:30:46,699
Hermes is off course.

1123
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:50,001
CAPCOM, advise Hermes they're drifting.
Guidance, get a correction ready.

1124
01:30:50,026 --> 01:30:53,180
Negative, Flight. It's not adrift.
They adjusted course.

1125
01:30:53,205 --> 01:30:54,345
What the hell?

1126
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:57,286
Telemetry, any chance this is
instrumentation failure?

1127
01:30:57,311 --> 01:30:58,478
Negative, Flight.

1128
01:30:58,503 --> 01:31:02,271
Guidance, work out how long they can
stay on this course before it's irreversible?

1129
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:04,387
Working on that now, Flight.

1130
01:31:04,412 --> 01:31:06,084
Who's Rich Purnell?

Annie will go before
the media this morning

1134
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:17,391
and inform them of NASA's decision
to reroute the Hermes to Mars.

1135
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,578
Sounds like a smart move.

1136
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,668
Considering the circumstances.

1137
01:31:22,916 --> 01:31:27,634
Whoever gave them the maneuver,
only passed along information.

1138
01:31:27,659 --> 01:31:30,114
The crew made the
decision on their own.

You may have killed them, Mitch.

SOL 219

1150
01:32:04,164 --> 01:32:07,039
Okay. Every Ares mission requires
3 years of pre-supplies.

1151
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,787
So NASA decided a long time ago
it's a lot easier to

1152
01:32:09,788 --> 01:32:12,539
send some of this stuff beforehand
rather than bring it with us.

1153
01:32:12,564 --> 01:32:16,231
So, as a result,
the MAV for Ares 4

1154
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:19,497
is already there, at the
Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

1155
01:32:19,522 --> 01:32:23,471
So, the plan is for me
to use that to go into orbit

1156
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:26,579
just as the Hermes is passing,

1157
01:32:26,609 --> 01:32:30,439
And I guess they catch me

1158
01:32:30,954 --> 01:32:33,031
in space.

1159
01:32:34,988 --> 01:32:38,079
So, I've got 200 Sols
 to figure out

1160
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,915
how to take everything here
that keeping me alive:

1161
01:32:40,916 --> 01:32:44,746
The oxygenator, the water reclaimer,
the atmospheric regulator.

1162
01:32:44,771 --> 01:32:46,699
Bring that all with me.

1163
01:32:46,724 --> 01:32:50,555
And luckily I have the-
the greatest minds on planet Earth,

01:32:55,748 --> 01:32:57,447
And so far they've come up with,

"Hey, why don't you drill holes
in the roof of your Rover

There's an international treaty
saying no country can lay claim

to anything that is not on Earth.

1202

And by another treaty,,
if you're not in any countries territory,

Maritime law applies.

So, Mars is "international waters."

1205
01:38:22,288 --> 01:38:25,451
Now, NASA is an American

it owns the hab.

make the MAV lighter.

1256
01:44:03,784 --> 01:44:06,415
A lot lighter.
5000 kg lighter.

1257
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,817
But, you can do that, right?

1258
01:44:07,818 --> 01:44:09,740
Well, there's some gimmes
right off the bat.

1259
01:44:09,765 --> 01:44:13,288
The design presumes 500 kg
of Martian soil and samples.

1260
01:44:13,289 --> 01:44:14,991
Obviously we won't do that.

1261
01:44:15,016 --> 01:44:18,723
And there's just 1 passenger
instead of 6.

1262
01:44:18,748 --> 01:44:21,438
With suits and gear,
that's another 500?

1263
01:44:21,463 --> 01:44:23,523
Ditch the support of life.
We don't need it.

1264
01:44:23,524 --> 01:44:25,950
And I'm going to make Mark to wear
his EVA suit for the whole trip.

1265
01:44:25,975 --> 01:44:28,687
Wait a second! If he's in his EVA suit,
How's he going to operate the controls?

1266
01:44:28,712 --> 01:44:31,023
Well, he won't.

1267
01:44:31,024 --> 01:44:34,815
Martinez will pilot the MAV
remotely from the Hermes.

1268
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:38,663
We've never had a manned ship
controlled remotely before.

1269
01:44:40,064 --> 01:44:43,613
But I am excited about the
opportunities that I forged.

1270
01:44:43,638 --> 01:44:48,362
If we go remote, we can lose the control panels,
the secondary, tertiary comm systems.

1271
01:44:48,387 --> 01:44:50,176
Wait. Wait a second.
You want to what?

1272
01:44:50,201 --> 01:44:54,230
You want to remotely controlled
ascent with no backup comms?

1273
01:44:55,148 --> 01:44:57,584
He's not even got to the
bad stuff yet, Vincent.

1274
01:44:57,609 --> 01:44:59,703
Well, let's get to the bad stuff!

1275
01:44:59,728 --> 01:45:05,216
We need to remove the nose airlock,
the windows and Hull Panel 19.

1276
01:45:05,755 --> 01:45:07,577
You want to take
the front of the ship off?

1277
01:45:07,602 --> 01:45:08,731
Sure.

1278
01:45:08,732 --> 01:45:11,850
The nose airlock alone is 400 kg.

1279
01:45:11,875 --> 01:45:14,207
You want to send a man into space
without the front of his ship?

1280
01:45:14,232 --> 01:45:15,696
Well, no.

1281
01:45:16,475 --> 01:45:20,438
We're going to have him
cover it with Hab canvas.

1282
01:45:21,301 --> 01:45:24,235
The hull's mostly there
to keep the air.

1283
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:27,406
Mars atmosphere is so thin,
you don't need a lot of streamlining.

1284
01:45:27,416 --> 01:45:30,915
By the time the ship's going fast enough
for air resistance to matter,

1285
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:33,539
it'll be high enough
that there's practically no air.

1286
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:36,400
You want to send him
into space under a tarp.

1287
01:45:36,425 --> 01:45:38,081
Yes.

1288
01:45:38,543 --> 01:45:40,212
Can I go on?

1289
01:45:40,237 --> 01:45:41,621
No.

1290
01:45:42,748 --> 01:45:45,464
Are you f---ing kidding me?

1291
01:45:47,768 --> 01:45:49,962
You think he means it like,

1292
01:45:50,411 --> 01:45:52,409
Are you kidding me?

1293
01:45:52,434 --> 01:45:53,716
- You know?
- Um-hum.

1294
01:45:53,748 --> 01:45:57,172
Or like,
"Are you kidding me?"

1295
01:45:57,646 --> 01:45:59,621
I think it might be
the second one.

1296
01:45:59,646 --> 01:46:01,218
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1297
01:46:01,243 --> 01:46:03,304
Could be the first one.

1298
01:46:03,456 --> 01:46:05,531
Are you kidding me?

1299
01:46:05,556 --> 01:46:07,767
Yeah, it could be the first one.

SOL 538

SCHIAPARELLI CRATER
Ares 4 LANDING SITE

1302
01:46:31,425 --> 01:46:33,673
I know what they are doing.

1303
01:46:34,754 --> 01:46:37,317
I know exactly what they are doing.

1304
01:46:37,416 --> 01:46:39,287
'Cause they're keep repeating,

1305
01:46:39,288 --> 01:46:42,579
Go faster than any man
in the history of space travel.

1306
01:46:42,604 --> 01:46:43,871
Like that's a good thing.

1307
01:46:43,896 --> 01:46:46,950
Like it would distract me
from how insane their plan is.

1308
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:51,247
Yeah. I get to go faster than any man
in the history of space travel.

1309
01:46:51,248 --> 01:46:54,287
Because you're launching me
in a convertible.

1310
01:46:54,288 --> 01:46:58,119
Actually, it's worse than that, because
I won't be able to control that thing.

1311
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:03,611
And by the way, physicists,
when describing things like acceleration,

1312
01:47:03,636 --> 01:47:06,832
do not use the word 'fast'.
So...

1313
01:47:06,857 --> 01:47:11,750
They're doing that, in the hopes
that I won't raise any objections.

1314
01:47:12,073 --> 01:47:14,366
It's a lunacy.

1315
01:47:15,042 --> 01:47:16,508
You think, because I like the way,

1316
01:47:16,533 --> 01:47:19,690
'The fastest man in the history of
space travel.' sounds.

1317
01:47:21,288 --> 01:47:23,632
I do like the way it sounds.

1318
01:47:24,576 --> 01:47:26,576
Yeah, I like it a lot.

1319
01:47:28,788 --> 01:47:31,027
I'm not going to
tell them that.

1320
01:47:36,946 --> 01:47:38,427
Okay.

1321
01:47:39,664 --> 01:47:41,356
Let's do this.

1322
01:48:16,646 --> 01:48:18,306
Come on.

1325
01:49:27,576 --> 01:49:31,098
(400 kg nose airlock?)

1326
01:50:12,455 --> 01:50:14,839
Beck and Vogel. I want
you guys in airlock 2.

1327
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:17,191
With the outer door open
before the MAV even launches.

1328
01:50:17,216 --> 01:50:17,881
Okay.

1329
01:50:17,882 --> 01:50:21,723
Martinez flies the MAV,
Johanssen sysop the ascent.

1330
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:25,703
Once we hit intercept,
it's Beck's job to go get Watney.

1331
01:50:25,704 --> 01:50:26,829
We're ready.

1332
01:50:26,854 --> 01:50:28,863
What's the intercept plan?

1333
01:50:28,888 --> 01:50:31,343
We finished attaching
the tethers into 1 long line

1334
01:50:31,372 --> 01:50:33,539
It's 214 meters long.

1335
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:36,265
And I'll have the MMU, so
moving around should be easy.

1336
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:39,223
How fast a relative velocity
can you handle?

1337
01:50:39,248 --> 01:50:41,976
I can grab the MAV at
5 meters per second.

1338
01:50:41,977 --> 01:50:43,855
Ten is like jumping onto a moving train.

1339
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:46,336
So, any more than that,
I might miss.

1340
01:50:46,361 --> 01:50:48,803
Well, we may have some leeway.

1341
01:50:49,748 --> 01:50:51,748
The launch takes 12 minutes,

1342
01:50:51,773 --> 01:50:54,744
and it will be 52 minutes
before intercept.

1343
01:50:54,769 --> 01:50:56,476
Once Mark's engines shut off,

1344
01:50:56,501 --> 01:51:00,139
we'll know our
intercept point and velocity.

1345
01:51:00,164 --> 01:51:01,842
Vogel, you're Beck's backup.

1346
01:51:01,867 --> 01:51:04,639
Everything goes well, you pull them
on board with the tether.

1347
01:51:04,664 --> 01:51:07,469
If anything goes wrong,
you go out after him.

1348
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:08,831
Yep.

1349
01:51:08,856 --> 01:51:10,383
Okay.

1350
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,078

There's a mood of tension and anxiety
here, outside Johnson Space Center.

1354

As you can see,
many people have gathered here,

1355
01:52:21,752 --> 01:52:27,015
To see whether or not, the mission to
retrieve Mark Watney will be a success.

1356
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:28,969
Remember, they had some kind
of contact with him.

1357
01:52:28,994 --> 01:52:30,205
but it hasn't been very much.

1358
01:52:30,230 --> 01:52:34,179
We have to remind our viewers
that we're watching this as it unfolds

1359

as to what exactly is going on.

Let's listen in to NASA,
making contact with Mark Watney.

1361

Let's listen in.

If something goes wrong,
What can Mission Control do?

1363
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:54,785
Not a damn thing.

1364
01:52:55,243 --> 01:52:57,163
It's all happening
12 light minutes away,

1365
01:52:57,164 --> 01:53:01,703
which means it takes 24 minutes for them
to get the answer to any question they ask.

1366
01:53:01,996 --> 01:53:04,624
Our launch is just 12 minutes,
so...

1367
01:53:05,834 --> 01:53:07,669

01:55:48,139 --> 01:55:49,871
Mooring clamps released.

1410
01:55:49,872 --> 01:55:51,623
About 5 seconds, Watney.
Hang on.

1411
01:55:51,648 --> 01:55:53,555
See you in a few, Commander.

1412
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:55,212
4.

1413
01:55:55,369 --> 01:55:56,774
3.

1414
01:55:56,965 --> 01:55:58,433
2.

1415
01:55:58,633 --> 01:56:00,042
1.

1416
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:38,239
Velocity, 741 meters per second.

1417
01:56:38,264 --> 01:56:40,288
Altitude, 1350 meters.

1418
01:56:40,313 --> 01:56:41,410
It's too low.

1419
01:56:41,435 --> 01:56:43,216
I know.
It's fighting me.

1420
01:56:46,748 --> 01:56:50,617
Watney, do you read?

1421
01:56:55,733 --> 01:56:57,411
Booster separation complete.

1422
01:56:57,412 --> 01:57:00,384
Velocity, 850.
Altitude, 1843.

1423
01:57:00,409 --> 01:57:01,921
He's way below target altitude.

1424
01:57:01,945 --> 01:57:03,781
How-How far below?

1425
01:57:03,807 --> 01:57:05,347
Checking.

1426
01:57:05,530 --> 01:57:08,759
Watney, do you read?

1427
01:57:08,784 --> 01:57:09,985
He's probably passed out

1428
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:12,594
He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.
Give him a few minutes.

1429
01:57:12,619 --> 01:57:14,087
Copy that.

1430
01:57:16,093 --> 01:57:18,093
Main shutdown in 3,

1431
01:57:18,118 --> 01:57:19,139
2,

1432
01:57:19,164 --> 01:57:20,400
1.

1433
01:57:20,425 --> 01:57:21,971
Shutdown.

1434
01:57:22,996 --> 01:57:25,107
Back to automatic guidance.

1435
01:57:25,132 --> 01:57:27,186
Shutdown confirmed.

1436
01:57:29,314 --> 01:57:31,533
Fuel reserve depleted.

1437
01:57:33,002 --> 01:57:34,390
Watney,

1438
01:57:34,704 --> 01:57:36,536
do you read?

1439
01:57:37,011 --> 01:57:40,007
There seems to be some sort
of problem with the transmission.

1440
01:57:46,767 --> 01:57:48,455
I have interval pings.

1441
01:57:48,456 --> 01:57:50,663
Intercept velocity will be
11 meters per second.

1442
01:57:50,664 --> 01:57:52,791
I can make that work.

1443
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,807
Distance at intercept will be...

1444
01:57:55,832 --> 01:57:57,931
We'll be 68 km apart.

1445
01:57:57,956 --> 01:58:00,018
68 km?

1446
01:58:00,043 --> 01:58:02,650
Did she just say 68 km?

1447
01:58:03,164 --> 01:58:05,931
Come on, guys, keep it together.
Work the problem.

1448
01:58:05,956 --> 01:58:08,289
Johanssen, time to intercept?

1449
01:58:08,314 --> 01:58:10,962
39 minutes 12 seconds.

1450
01:58:10,987 --> 01:58:14,055
Martinez, what if we point
our thrusters in the same direction?

1451
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:16,572
Well, it depends on how much
fuel you want to save

1452
01:58:16,597 --> 01:58:18,703
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.

1453
01:58:18,704 --> 01:58:19,970
How much do you need?

1454
01:58:19,995 --> 01:58:24,627
I can get by with about 20%
of what we have left.

1455
01:58:24,860 --> 01:58:28,679
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude adjustment fuel,

1456
01:58:28,704 --> 01:58:31,114
That'll bring the intercept range to zero.

1457
01:58:31,139 --> 01:58:32,692
Do this.

1458
01:58:32,717 --> 01:58:35,159
Hang on.
It brings the range to zero,

1459
01:58:35,184 --> 01:58:38,763
but the intercept velocity will be
42 meters per second.

1460
01:58:38,788 --> 01:58:40,779
And it's way too fast.

1461
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:44,829
Then, we have 39 minutes
to figure out how to slow down.

1462
01:58:47,543 --> 01:58:49,477
Martinez, burn the jets.

1463
01:58:49,502 --> 01:58:51,058
Copy that.

1464
01:59:13,248 --> 01:59:15,455
Mav to Hermes.

1465
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,531
Watney?

1466
01:59:16,556 --> 01:59:18,327
Affirmative.

1467
01:59:21,579 --> 01:59:23,320
What's your status?

1468
01:59:23,345 --> 01:59:25,347
My chest hurts.

1469
01:59:25,372 --> 01:59:27,586
I have broken my ribs.

1470
01:59:27,611 --> 01:59:28,807
How are you?

1471
01:59:28,832 --> 01:59:31,663
We're working on getting to you.
There was a complication during the launch.

1472
01:59:31,664 --> 01:59:33,384
Copy that.

1473
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:35,203
Well, how bad is it?

1474
01:59:35,204 --> 01:59:39,021
Well, we corrected the intercept range,
but we got a problem with intercept velocity.

1475
01:59:39,046 --> 01:59:40,411
How big a problem?

1476
01:59:40,412 --> 01:59:42,402
42 meters per second.

1477
01:59:42,427 --> 01:59:44,084
Well,

1478
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:46,340
shit.

1479
01:59:50,956 --> 01:59:53,145
Commander, I have an idea.

1480
01:59:53,146 --> 01:59:54,635
Go ahead, Mark.

1481
01:59:54,660 --> 01:59:57,831
Well, If I can find something
 sharp in here

1482
01:59:57,832 --> 02:00:00,831
and poke a hole in the
glove of my EVA suit.

1483
02:00:00,832 --> 02:00:03,455
I could use the escaping air
as a thruster

1484
02:00:03,456 --> 02:00:04,995
and fly towards you.

1485
02:00:04,996 --> 02:00:08,331
It would be easy to control,
because it would be on my arm.

1486
02:00:08,332 --> 02:00:10,466
I can't see you having any control
if you did that.

1487
02:00:10,491 --> 02:00:14,775
You'd be eyeballing the intercept using
a thrust vector you can barely controls

1488
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,363
Yes. Yes.
Those are all very good points.

1489
02:00:18,742 --> 02:00:22,120
But, consider this:

1490
02:00:23,508 --> 02:00:26,624
I'd get to fly around
like Iron Man.

1491
02:00:27,664 --> 02:00:29,163
Commander,

1492
02:00:29,188 --> 02:00:31,340
let's go Iron Man.

1493
02:00:33,873 --> 02:00:35,498
This is unexpected, LOS.

1494
02:00:35,523 --> 02:00:38,094
Communication lost.
Standby.

1495
02:00:38,388 --> 02:00:41,099
Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1496
02:00:41,124 --> 02:00:43,123
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

1497
02:00:43,124 --> 02:00:44,411
Not what he said.

1498
02:00:44,412 --> 02:00:47,490
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1499
02:00:48,770 --> 02:00:50,869
What happens if we blow the VAL?

1500
02:00:50,894 --> 02:00:52,901
What? You want to open
the vehicular airlock?

1501
02:00:52,926 --> 02:00:54,098
It'd give us a good kick.

1502
02:00:54,099 --> 02:00:55,784
Yeah, but it will also blow
the nose off the ship.

1503
02:00:55,809 --> 02:00:59,050
And all the air will leave,
and we need air to not die.

1504
02:00:59,075 --> 02:01:01,472
We'll seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

1505
02:01:01,497 --> 02:01:03,718
Everywhere else will go vacuo.

1506
02:01:03,745 --> 02:01:04,799
Vogel.

1507
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,188
Go ahead, Commander.

1508
02:01:06,213 --> 02:01:09,192
I need you to come inside
and make a... bomb.

1509
02:01:09,217 --> 02:01:10,614
Uh.
Again, Commander?

1510
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:11,754
You're a chemist.

1511
02:01:11,779 --> 02:01:14,368
Can you make a bomb with
what you have on board?

1512
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:16,752
Probably.

1513
02:01:17,486 --> 02:01:20,809
But I feel obliged to mention that
setting off an explosive device

1514
02:01:20,834 --> 02:01:24,051
in a spacecraft is a
terrible terrible idea.

1515
02:01:24,076 --> 02:01:26,989
Hang on. You guys making
a bomb without me?

1516
02:01:27,014 --> 02:01:29,871
Copy that.
Can you do it?

1517
02:01:31,470 --> 02:01:32,905
Yeah.

1518
02:01:35,055 --> 02:01:38,546
Houston. Be advised we're going to
deliberately breach the VAL

1519
02:01:38,571 --> 02:01:41,306
- to produce some reverse thrust.
- What?

1520
02:01:41,331 --> 02:01:43,945
Beck, leave your suit on,
meet Johanssen in airlock 1.

1521
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:45,257
We'll open the outer door.

1522
02:01:45,282 --> 02:01:47,379
I need you to place the charge
on the inner door.

1523
02:01:47,404 --> 02:01:49,626
Climb back to airlock 2
along the hull.

1524
02:01:49,651 --> 02:01:52,166
Copy.
I'm on my way.

1525
02:01:58,625 --> 02:02:00,350
I'm in, Commander.

1526
02:02:00,375 --> 02:02:01,977
Copy that.

1527
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:12,287
Vogel, where are you?

1528
02:02:12,312 --> 02:02:14,897
- I'm in the kitchen.
- Okay.

1529
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:19,709
Commander,

1530
02:02:19,734 --> 02:02:21,707
I can't let you
go through with this.

1531
02:02:21,708 --> 02:02:23,579
I am prepared to cut the suit.

1532
02:02:23,580 --> 02:02:24,787
Absolutely not.

1533
02:02:24,788 --> 02:02:27,415
Well, see.
The thing is, I'm selfish.

1534
02:02:27,416 --> 02:02:30,455
I want all the memorials
back home to be about me.

1535
02:02:30,456 --> 02:02:31,495
Just me.

1536
02:02:31,496 --> 02:02:34,051
I should have
left this guy on Mars.

1537
02:02:34,076 --> 02:02:35,458
Hey.

1538
02:02:38,029 --> 02:02:40,407
-Sugar?
- Yeah.

1539
02:02:44,208 --> 02:02:45,779
Can you hold this?

1540
02:02:46,184 --> 02:02:48,055
Liquid oxygen.

1541
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,176
Add some stain remover
that contains ammonia.

1542
02:02:54,846 --> 02:02:56,657
This thing here,

1543
02:02:56,890 --> 02:03:00,040
is 5 times stronger than
a stick of dynamite.

1544
02:03:00,065 --> 02:03:01,413
How do we activate it?

1545
02:03:01,444 --> 02:03:04,178
You can connect this to
one of your lighting panels.

1546
02:03:07,963 --> 02:03:09,647
Careful.

1547
02:03:15,496 --> 02:03:17,545
Open airlock 1.

1548
02:03:22,832 --> 02:03:24,869
I'm on the way to Beck.

1549
02:03:28,288 --> 02:03:30,510
I just hope this is a
good idea, guys.

1550
02:03:30,535 --> 02:03:33,109
- It is.
- Open A1.

1551
02:03:37,842 --> 02:03:39,142
Hi.

1552
02:03:42,746 --> 02:03:44,286
You have it?

1553
02:03:49,748 --> 02:03:52,976
Make sure you're not in here
when this thing goes off.

1554
02:03:54,307 --> 02:03:55,650
Hey.

1555
02:03:55,651 --> 02:03:57,515
Be Careful out there.

1556
02:03:57,540 --> 02:03:59,289
In space.

1557
02:04:02,768 --> 02:04:04,839
Don't tell anyone I did that.

1558
02:04:15,166 --> 02:04:16,849
Bomb set.

1559
02:04:24,858 --> 02:04:27,691
Leaving airlock 1.

1560
02:04:32,124 --> 02:04:34,978
Guys, I'm running the numbers,
even with optimum VAL blow,

1561
02:04:35,003 --> 02:04:36,632
We're going to be off
on our angle.

1562
02:04:36,664 --> 02:04:39,471
What's the intercept distance?
Johanssen?

1563
02:04:39,496 --> 02:04:41,995
260 meters to approximate.

1564
02:04:41,996 --> 02:04:43,867
It's too far.

1565
02:04:52,332 --> 02:04:53,747
Commander?

1566
02:04:53,748 --> 02:04:56,131
Martinez, close the door.

1567
02:04:58,724 --> 02:05:00,655
Open D3.

1568
02:05:01,188 --> 02:05:02,930
Leave it open.

1569
02:05:31,482 --> 02:05:33,533
Open B2.

1570
02:05:37,469 --> 02:05:38,707
Johanssen,

1571
02:05:38,708 --> 02:05:41,207
Time to VAL blow after initiate?

1572
02:05:41,208 --> 02:05:42,660
15 seconds.

1573
02:05:42,685 --> 02:05:45,249
We sure know how
to cut it close.

1574
02:05:45,687 --> 02:05:46,707
Commander.

1575
02:05:46,732 --> 02:05:49,583
The distance is too far,
I'm going out.

1576
02:05:49,608 --> 02:05:51,556
- I can do this.
- It's not a debate.

1577
02:05:51,581 --> 02:05:53,614
I'm not risking another crew member.

1578
02:05:53,639 --> 02:05:55,140
Beck's returned.

1579
02:05:55,165 --> 02:05:57,228
Johanssen, initiate the bomb.

1580
02:05:57,253 --> 02:05:58,645
10 seconds.

1581
02:05:58,670 --> 02:06:00,296
Strap in.

1582
02:06:00,321 --> 02:06:01,688
5.

1583
02:06:01,982 --> 02:06:03,370
4.

1584
02:06:03,479 --> 02:06:04,163
3.

1585
02:06:04,164 --> 02:06:06,728
-Deceleration!
-2,

1586
02:06:06,839 --> 02:06:07,561
1.

1587
02:06:07,586 --> 02:06:09,923
Activating the panel 41.

1588
02:06:30,993 --> 02:06:32,507
Bridge seal holding.

1589
02:06:32,532 --> 02:06:34,787
- What's the damage?
- Worry about that later.

1590
02:06:34,788 --> 02:06:36,495
What's the relative velocity?

1591
02:06:36,496 --> 02:06:38,051
12 meters per second.

1592
02:06:38,076 --> 02:06:39,692
Copy.

1593
02:06:42,009 --> 02:06:43,625
Hook me up.

1594
02:06:44,498 --> 02:06:46,079
Done.

1595
02:06:55,549 --> 02:06:57,633
I've visual of the MAV.

1596
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:00,558
What's the intercept range?

1597
02:07:00,583 --> 02:07:02,293
I'm checking.

1598
02:07:02,779 --> 02:07:04,331
312 meters.

1599
02:07:04,332 --> 02:07:06,933
Did you say 312?

1600
02:07:06,958 --> 02:07:09,755
Okay. I'll wave at
you guys as I go by.

1601
02:07:12,632 --> 02:07:14,005
Oh.

1602
02:07:18,456 --> 02:07:20,750
I can't get to you, Mark.
You're too far.

1603
02:07:20,775 --> 02:07:22,771
- I'm not going to make it
- I know.

1604
02:07:22,803 --> 02:07:24,940
Beck, unhook me.
I'm going after him.

1605
02:07:24,965 --> 02:07:27,941
Commander, I got this.

1606
02:07:41,248 --> 02:07:43,046
Mark, report.

1607
02:07:43,143 --> 02:07:45,144
On my way, Commander.

1608
02:07:45,169 --> 02:07:46,715
Damn it.

1609
02:07:55,916 --> 02:07:58,415
Johanssen, what's my
relative velocity to Mark?

1610
02:07:58,416 --> 02:08:00,455
5.2 meters per second.

1611
02:08:00,456 --> 02:08:02,964
Copy.
Adjusting course.

1612
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:10,407
3.1 meters per second.

1613
02:08:12,237 --> 02:08:14,966
Distance to target 24 meters.

1614
02:08:16,204 --> 02:08:18,711
11 meters to target.

1615
02:08:21,048 --> 02:08:22,655
6 meters.

1616
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:34,922
Hold on, Mark.

1617
02:08:55,768 --> 02:08:57,310
Come on.

1618
02:09:02,425 --> 02:09:03,983
I got him!

1619
02:09:06,294 --> 02:09:07,842
I got him.

1620
02:09:08,697 --> 02:09:09,847
I got him.

1621
02:09:09,872 --> 02:09:11,976
Way to go, Iron Man.

1622
02:09:14,606 --> 02:09:16,737
Beck, pull us in.

1623
02:09:19,361 --> 02:09:21,401
It's good to see you.

1624
02:09:22,770 --> 02:09:24,198
You...

1625
02:09:25,685 --> 02:09:28,084
have... terrible taste

1626
02:09:28,109 --> 02:09:29,722
in music.

1627
02:09:38,553 --> 02:09:40,909
Houston, this is Hermes Actual.

1628
02:09:40,934 --> 02:09:42,007
We got him.

1629
02:09:42,032 --> 02:09:43,391
YEAH!

1630
02:09:43,416 --> 02:09:45,286
Watney is secure.

1631
02:09:45,311 --> 02:09:48,374
YES! YES!
YES!

1632
02:09:50,392 --> 02:09:52,725
Contact in outer space,
with Mark Watney.

1633
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:57,079
After a very long time, they have done
what many people thought was impossible.

1634
02:09:57,104 --> 02:10:00,895
Mark Watney has been successfully rescued.

1635
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:04,515
Mark Watney has been rescued.
This has been an incredible mission.

1636
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:06,454
Get a hold of him.

1637
02:10:08,292 --> 02:10:09,569
Hey-Hey, handsome.

1638
02:10:09,594 --> 02:10:11,615
Beck, close the hatch.

1639
02:10:14,404 --> 02:10:16,258
Hey, guys!

1640
02:10:20,164 --> 02:10:23,877
Houston, 6 crews safely aboard.

1641
02:10:27,117 --> 02:10:30,136
This is a huge moment
for this nation, for the world

1642
02:10:30,161 --> 02:10:33,651
and, in deed,
for international space travel.

1643
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:38,447
- Hey.
- Hey.

1644
02:10:39,754 --> 02:10:41,556
Oh god!

1645
02:10:43,441 --> 02:10:45,253
There's a little sloth going on
over there, man.

1646
02:10:45,278 --> 02:10:48,925
I know. I haven't had a shower
for a year and a half.

1647
02:10:49,107 --> 02:10:52,240
Don't make me laugh.
I have a broken rib.

1648
02:11:25,577 --> 02:11:27,045
Hey, there.

1649
02:11:35,264 --> 02:11:36,573
Good day, sir.

1650
02:11:36,598 --> 02:11:38,829
- It's an honor, sir.
- Sir.

1651
02:11:39,088 --> 02:11:40,939
- Sir.
- Sir.

1652
02:11:40,964 --> 02:11:42,648
Good morning, sir.

1653
02:11:52,190 --> 02:11:54,735
DAY 1

1654
02:12:04,107 --> 02:12:06,911
Welcome to the
Astronaut Candidate Program.

1655
02:12:06,936 --> 02:12:10,921
Now pay attention,
because this could save your life.

1656
02:12:10,946 --> 02:12:13,357
Trust me. I know what
I'm talking about.

1657
02:12:13,810 --> 02:12:16,016
Alright. Let me get a few things
out of the way, right off the bat.

1658
02:12:16,041 --> 02:12:22,635
Yes, I did in fact survive on a deserted
planet by farming in my own shit.

1659
02:12:23,133 --> 02:12:28,114
Yes, it's actually worse than it sound.
So, let's not talk about that ever again.

1660
02:12:28,666 --> 02:12:31,778
The other question
I get most frequently is.

1661
02:12:31,849 --> 02:12:34,420
When I was up there
stranded by myself,

1662
02:12:34,445 --> 02:12:36,643
Did I think I was going to die?

1663
02:12:37,396 --> 02:12:39,624
Yes, absolutely.

1664
02:12:40,015 --> 02:12:43,386
And that's when you need to know going in,
because it's going to happen to you.

1665
02:12:43,411 --> 02:12:47,056
This is space.
It does not cooperate.

1666
02:12:47,088 --> 02:12:50,003
At some point, everything's
going to go south on you.

1667
02:12:50,004 --> 02:12:53,046
Everything's going to go south
and you're going to say "This is it."

1668
02:12:53,071 --> 02:12:54,921
That is how I end.

1669
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:58,107
Now you can either accept that,

1670
02:12:58,132 --> 02:13:00,050
or you can get to work.

1671
02:13:01,172 --> 02:13:03,082
That's all it is.

1672
02:13:03,107 --> 02:13:05,461
You just begin.

1673
02:13:05,712 --> 02:13:08,879
You do the math.
You solve one problem

1674
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,815
and you solve the next one,

1675
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:11,821
and then the next.

1676
02:13:11,846 --> 02:13:14,623
And If you solve enough problems,
you get to come home.

1677
02:13:15,527 --> 02:13:18,095
Alright.
Questions?

1678
02:13:22,464 --> 02:13:25,146
Once Mission Control complete
their preflight checks,

1679
02:13:25,171 --> 02:13:27,234
we'll begin launch procedures.

1680
02:13:27,261 --> 02:13:29,928
The Ares 5 team will
rendezvous with the Hermes

1681
02:13:29,953 --> 02:13:33,128
approximately 48 minutes after launch.

1682
02:13:33,153 --> 02:13:37,047
From there, they'll have 414 days
of space travel ahead of them.

1683
02:13:37,048 --> 02:13:41,008
Have the goals changed from the
previous mission to the Ares 5 program?

1684
02:13:41,033 --> 02:13:43,339
And what do you hope
to achieve this time around?

1685
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:47,490
Well, no. The goals has always been
the same for the Ares Program.

1686
02:13:47,793 --> 02:13:51,662
This time, of course we hope to bring
all the astronauts back at the same time.

1687
02:13:51,687 --> 02:13:55,023
- Flight, Guidance check complete.
- Copy, Guidance.

1688
02:13:55,048 --> 02:13:59,202
This is Flight.
We are go for launch on schedule.

1689
02:14:09,262 --> 02:14:11,721
Final Aerial Service Check are complete.

1690
02:14:11,756 --> 02:14:15,478
As everything remains a go.
for the launch of the Ares 5.

1691
02:14:15,503 --> 02:14:17,051
20 seconds.

1692
02:14:18,048 --> 02:14:19,855
Proceeding with the count.

1693
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:21,575
T minus 10.

1694
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:22,675
9.

1695
02:14:22,700 --> 02:14:23,998
Main engine start.

1696
02:14:24,023 --> 02:14:27,975
7, 6, 5, 4,

1697
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,355
3, 2, 1.

1698
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:32,822
And liftoff.

1699
02:14:32,847 --> 02:14:39,087
As the crew of the Ares 5 begin the
next chapter of America's space exploration.

1700
02:14:39,088 --> 02:14:40,882
Pressure look good.

1701
02:14:42,315 --> 02:14:43,752
Woo!

1702
02:14:59,050 --> 02:15:00,671
Wow, good shot.

1703
02:15:00,672 --> 02:15:04,423
There it is. 5 years after the
rescue of astronaut Mark Watney,

1704
02:15:04,424 --> 02:15:08,089
the Ares 5 is on it's way to Mars.
