1
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,520
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,060
Jimmy?

3
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,400
- What's up?
- Did I hit something?

4
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,190
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,200
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
No.

7
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,240
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,900
He's still alive. You piece of shit!

9
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,610
Die, you motherfucker!

10
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,110
Look at me!

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,210
As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.

12
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,210
To me...

13
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,880
...being a gangster was better than
being president of the United States.

14
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,470
Even before I went to the cabstand
for an after-schooljob...

15
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,930
...I knew I wanted to be part of them.

16
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,310
It was there that I knew I belonged.
To me, it meant being somebody...

17
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,930
...in a neighborhood full of nobodies.

18
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,560
They weren't like anybody else.
They did whatever they wanted.

19
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,190
They parked in front of hydrants
and never got a ticket.

20
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,490
When they played cards all night...

21
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,700
...nobody ever called the cops.

22
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,670
Tony Stacks. How are you?

23
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,590
Tuddy Cicero.

24
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,170
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

25
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,300
Tuddy.

26
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,770
Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...

27
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,810
...and other places for his brother, Paul,
who was the boss of the neighborhood.

28
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,320
Paulie might have moved slow...

29
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,910
...but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.

30
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,370
- It's your fault.
- You started it!

31
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,290
I started it? It's your fault.

32
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,960
At first my parents loved that I found
a job across the street from the house.

33
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,720
My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.

34
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,100
He liked that I got myself a job.

35
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,850
He always used to say
that American kids were spoiled lazy.

36
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,320
Henry! Watch how you cross!

37
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,110
Bring back milk!

38
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,360
My mother was happy after
she found out the Ciceros...

39
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,120
...came from the same part of Sicily
as she did. To my mother...

40
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,990
...that was the answer to all her prayers.

41
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,580
I was the luckiest kid in the world.

42
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,960
I could go anywhere, do anything.

43
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,670
I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.

44
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,430
Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy
would let me park their Cadillacs.

45
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,560
Here I am, this little kid,
I can't even see over the steering wheel...

46
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,680
...and I'm parking Cadillacs.

47
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,150
But, it wasn't too long...

48
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,650
...before my parents changed
their minds about myjob at the cabstand.

49
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,610
For them, it was supposed to be
a part-timejob. But for me...

50
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,700
...it was definitely full time.

51
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,700
That's all I wanted to do.

52
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,120
People like my father could never
understand, but I was part of something.

53
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,040
I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.

54
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,670
Tell him 519.

55
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,670
Every day I was learning to score.

56
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,760
A dollar here, a dollar there.
I was living in a fantasy.

57
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,310
Did you have a good day at school?

58
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,640
My father was always pissed off.

59
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,350
Pissed that he made such lousy money,
that my brother Michael...

60
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,980
...was in a wheelchair.

61
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,070
He was pissed that there were seven of us
living in such a tiny house.

62
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,030
Tell me about this.

63
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,360
It's a letter from school.

64
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,780
It says you haven't been there in months.

65
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,700
In months!

66
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,750
You're a bum!

67
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,250
Want to grow up to be a bum?

68
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,880
After a while, he was mostly pissed
because I hung around the cabstand.

69
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,050
He knew what went on there.

70
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,970
Every once in a while I'd have to take
a beating. But by then, I didn't care.

71
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,850
The way I saw it...

72
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,890
...everybody takes a beating sometime.

73
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,690
I can't make any more deliveries.

74
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,980
What? You'll fuck everything up.

75
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,190
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

76
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,650
Come with me.

77
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,490
- Is that him there?
- No.

78
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,990
- How about him?
- No.

79
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,990
- That's the guy-
- Get him.

80
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,250
Excuse me.

81
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,000
- Scumbag.
- Come here, you piece of shit.

82
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,720
- Know this kid?
- Yeah.

83
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,930
- Know where he lives?
- Yeah.

84
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,060
- You deliver mail to his house?
- Yeah.

85
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,140
From now on, any letter from school
to his house comes directly here.

86
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,560
Understand?

87
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,860
Another letter from school
goes to that kid's house...

88
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,150
...in the oven you'll go, head first.

89
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,570
That was it. No more letters from
truant officers. No letters from school.

90
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,870
In fact, no more letters from anybody.

91
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,700
After a few weeks, my mother went
to the post office to complain.

92
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,000
How could I go to school after that...

93
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,880
...and pledge allegiance and sit through
good government bullshit?

94
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,630
Paulie hated phones.
He wouldn't have one in his house.

95
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,220
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

96
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,050
All right, make the call.

97
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,770
He got all his calls second hand.
Then you'd have to call the people back.

98
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,520
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

99
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07,110
There were guys, that's all they did all
day, was take care of Paulie's calls.

100
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,080
For a guy who moved all day long...

101
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,290
...Paulie didn't talk to six people.
With union problems...

102
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,330
...or a beef in the numbers...

103
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,840
...only the top guys spoke
with Paulie about the problem.

104
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,510
Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

105
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,590
He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said...

106
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,680
...or anyone listening to
what he was being told.

107
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,310
Hundreds of guys depended on him, and
he got a piece of everything they made.

108
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,980
It was a tribute, like in the old country,
except they were doing it in America.

109
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,530
All they got from Paulie was protection
from the guys trying to rip them off.

110
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,860
That's what it's all about. That's
what the FBI could never understand.

111
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,580
What Paulie and the Organization does...

112
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,500
...is protect people who can't
go to the cops. That's it.

113
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,210
They're like the police department
for wiseguys.

114
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,140
People looked at me differently,
and they knew I was with somebody.

115
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,770
I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery
on Sunday morning for fresh bread.

116
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,270
The owner knew who I was with, and no
matter how many people were waiting...

117
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,360
...I was taken care of first.

118
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,070
Our neighbors stopped parking in
our driveway, even though we had no car.

119
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
At 13...

120
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,870
...I was making more money than most
of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.

121
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,660
I had it all.

122
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,420
One day...

123
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,220
One day, some neighborhood kids carried
my mother's groceries all the way home.

124
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,850
You know why?

125
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,560
It was out of respect.

126
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,770
What do you think?

127
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,810
Aren't my shoes great?

128
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,900
You look like a gangster.

129
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,820
They shot me. Help!

130
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,070
Henry, shut the door.

131
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,200
That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

132
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,580
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

133
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,420
I can't have that in this joint.

134
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,380
I remember feeling bad about the guy,
but also...

135
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,760
...feeling maybe Tuddy was right.

136
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,550
I knew Paulie didn't want
anyone dying in the building.

137
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,390
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

138
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,890
What's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

139
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,540
It was a glorious time.

140
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,120
And wiseguys were all over the place.

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,840
It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe...

142
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,920
...decided to take on
a boss and start a war.

143
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,720
It was when I met the world.

144
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,760
And it was when
I first met Jimmy Conway.

145
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,810
He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29
at the time, but he was already a legend.

146
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,520
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the roomjust went wild.

147
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,440
He'd give a doorman $100
just for opening the door.

148
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,280
He'd give hundreds to the dealers
and the guys who ran the games.

149
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,530
The bartender got $100 just
for keeping the ice cubes cold.

150
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,450
The Irishman is here
to take you Guineas' money.

151
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,080
- Want a drink?
- Give me a Seven and Seven.

152
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,840
I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.

153
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,470
How you doin'?

154
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,850
Thank you.

155
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,270
Keep them coming.

156
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,390
Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

157
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,900
He was first locked up at 11,
and doing hits for mob bosses at 16.

158
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,530
Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

159
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,070
But what Jimmy really loved to do...
what he really loved to do was steal.

160
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,280
He actually enjoyed it.

161
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,830
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted
for the bad guys in movies.

162
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,040
Give me your wallet.

163
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,340
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are.

164
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,550
He was one of the city's biggest hijackers...

165
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,510
...of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp and lobsters.

166
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,350
Shrimp and lobsters were best.

167
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,760
They went fast.

168
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,770
Almost all of them were gimmies.
They just gave it up, no problem.

169
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,560
They called him Jimmy the Gent.

170
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,850
Help the lady.

171
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,320
Drivers loved him.
They used to tip him off...

172
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,900
...about the really good loads.
Of course, everybody got a piece.

173
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,490
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

174
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,620
Henry, come here.

175
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,040
Say hello to Tommy.

176
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,120
You're gonna be working together, okay?
Help him. Go ahead.

177
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,250
Jimmy, you got anything good?

178
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,720
And when the cops assigned a whole
army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?

179
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,680
He made them partners.

180
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,680
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

181
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,600
- What do you need?
- Two Luckys.

182
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,100
- Here you go, Henry.
- Thanks a lot.

183
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,900
- What do you need?
- One Pall Mall.

184
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,070
What are you doing?

185
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,110
- It's all right.
- Says who? Your mother?

186
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,740
How many Pall Malls you need?

187
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,910
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

188
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,870
- It's okay.
- It's not okay!

189
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,660
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.

190
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,790
- Henry got pinched.
- Where?

191
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,750
By the factory.

192
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,090
Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

193
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,930
Docket #704162.

194
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,220
Yes, sir. That's me.

195
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,810
Just stand there. Now stay there.

196
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,030
Counselor, proceed.

197
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,120
Congratulations.

198
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,990
Here's your graduation present.

199
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,450
- Why? I got pinched.
- Everyone does, but you did it right.

200
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,460
- You told them nothing.
- I thought you'd be mad.

201
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,750
I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

202
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,920
You took your first pinch like a man...

203
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,760
...and learned the two greatest things
in life.

204
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,300
Look at me.

205
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,430
Never rat on your friends...

206
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,010
...and always keep your mouth shut.

207
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,640
Here he is!

208
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,020
You broke your cherry!

209
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,610
Congratulations!

210
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,030
By the time I grew up,
there was 30 billion a year in cargo...

211
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,910
...moving through Idlewild Airport,
and we tried to steal every bit of it.

212
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,580
See, we grew up near the airport.

213
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,120
It belonged to Paulie. We had friends
and relatives who worked all over it.

214
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,290
They would tip us off about what
was coming in and moving out.

215
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,380
If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...

216
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,630
...Paulie's union people scared them
with a strike. It was beautiful.

217
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,800
It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers
and Jimmy was in charge.

218
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,810
Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

219
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,350
To us, it was better than Citibank.

220
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,530
You got a phone? Come on!

221
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,200
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?

222
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,960
There was Jimmy and Tommy...

223
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,420
...and me.

224
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,880
And there was Anthony Stabile.

225
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,630
Frankie Carbone.

226
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,010
And then there was Mo Black's brother,
Fat Andy.

227
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,310
And his guys, Frankie the Wop...

228
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,640
...and Freddy No Nose.

229
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,110
And then there was Pete the Killer,
who was Sally Balls' brother.

230
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,490
Then you had Nickey Eyes...

231
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,660
...and Mikey Franzese.

232
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,700
Jimmy Two-Times, nicknamed
because he said everything twice.

233
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,410
I'll get the papers, get the papers.

234
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,140
What is this? Coats?
I need suits, Henry, not coats.

235
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,560
Suits are up on Thursday.

236
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,810
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

237
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,110
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

238
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,320
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat.

239
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,400
For us, to live any other way was nuts.

240
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,830
To us, those goody-good people who
worked shittyjobs for bum paychecks...

241
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,000
...and took the subway to work and
worried about bills, were dead.

242
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,920
They were suckers. They had no balls.

243
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,540
If we wanted something, wejust took it.

244
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,050
If anyone complained twice, they got
hit so bad they never complained again.

245
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,840
It was alljust routine.
You didn't even think about it.

246
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,970
Frankie, what the fuck does 520...

247
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,810
...have to do with 469?

248
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,850
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

249
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,150
Piece of cake. Don't worry about
the alarms. I just got to get a key.

250
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,660
- No problems?
- I'll take care of it.

251
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,790
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.

252
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,170
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

253
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,430
Americans change their money over
into French money and send it back here.

254
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,850
- Calm down.
- It's beautiful.

255
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,930
It's totally, totally untraceable.

256
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,310
Our only problem is getting a key,
but I got a plan.

257
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,900
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
- Yeah, he's a piece of work.

258
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,990
If I'm right, there could be
half a mil coming in, all cash.

259
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,740
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

260
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,290
There's a Jewish holiday Monday. They
won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.

261
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,210
What about the security?

262
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,670
Security?

263
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,420
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

264
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,840
He just comes in like
he's picking up lost baggage.

265
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,470
- It's beautiful.
- It won't be a problem at all.

266
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,220
- Good.
- We're on.

267
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,770
What's really funny is that
fucking bank job in Secaucus.

268
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,980
I'm in the weeds lying down.

269
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,560
He said, "What are you doing?"
I said, "Resting. "

270
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,650
"Here?"

271
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,860
"This ain't no beach or park. "
"I'm resting!" I said.

272
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,780
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

273
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,280
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing. "

274
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,830
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today. "

275
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,580
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother. "

276
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,550
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

277
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,090
I'm coming around and who do I see
in front of me?

278
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,310
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

279
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,100
I said, "What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother. "

280
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,270
I thought he'd shit.

281
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,400
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

282
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,450
Funny. You're really funny.

283
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,950
What do you mean, I'm funny?

284
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,000
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

285
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,960
You're a funny guy.

286
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,130
You mean the way I talk? What?

287
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,880
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

288
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,130
You know, the way you tell the story.

289
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,970
Funny how? What's funny about it?

290
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,970
- Tommy, you got it all wrong.
- Anthony-

291
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,850
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
Funny, how?

292
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,150
Just, you know. You're funny.

293
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,320
Let me understand this.

294
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,490
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

295
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,280
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

296
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,620
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

297
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,370
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

298
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,000
You know, how you tell a story.

299
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,050
No, I don't know. You said it.
You said I'm funny.

300
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,800
How am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

301
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,050
Tell me what's funny!

302
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,600
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

303
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,520
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

304
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,530
You stuttering prick, you!

305
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,700
Frankie, was he shaking?

306
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,080
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning!

307
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,080
What's with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

308
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,590
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?

309
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,180
This guy didn't want to give you the check.

310
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,260
Could you take care of this?

311
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,010
No problem. Tell him to put it on my tab.

312
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,140
That's what I want to talk to you about.

313
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,850
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

314
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,110
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order-

315
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,780
It's good you don't like to be out of order,
Sonny.

316
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,860
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

317
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,620
You're a mutt. You know the money
we spend in this fucking-

318
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,910
- Don't be like that.
- Like what?

319
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,630
Do you believe this prick?

320
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,760
You think this is funny?

321
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,720
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

322
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,970
You don't want to bring the check?

323
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,350
Do you believe this prick?

324
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,150
You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.

325
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,940
You're a funny guy.

326
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,490
That's it, Henry!

327
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,910
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.

328
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,870
I charged him $7,000.

329
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,960
You really are a funny guy.

330
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,300
I'm worried. I'm hearing bad things.

331
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,140
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.

332
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,600
I got to go on the lam
to get away from this guy.

333
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,850
This ain't right. I can't go here or there.

334
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,350
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.

335
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,610
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.

336
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,150
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.

337
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,660
You've known this Tommy all your life.

338
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,990
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

339
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,040
When I leave my house in the morning
I look over both shoulders.

340
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,290
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.

341
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,040
- Tell me what to do, I'll do it.
- What could I do?

342
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,340
If there was something I could do,
I would. I'd like to help you out.

343
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,340
Tell him what we talked about.

344
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,350
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

345
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,230
What are you talking about?

346
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,020
You mean the restaurant?

347
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,860
It's a classy place.

348
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,690
You've been in here a million times.

349
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,070
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

350
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,830
I don't mean any disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

351
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,960
I'm begging you. What can I say?

352
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,500
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?

353
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,340
I don't know anything about
the restaurant business.

354
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,590
All I know is how to sit down
and order a meal.

355
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,050
Not for you. Just a place to hang.

356
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,810
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

357
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,810
What do you want from me?

358
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,600
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

359
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,810
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

360
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,240
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.

361
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,080
I just need help. Help me, please.

362
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,160
Know anything about
the restaurant business?

363
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,830
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.

364
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,210
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

365
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,590
You want me to be your partner?

366
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,680
Is that what you're telling me?

367
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,140
What do you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please.

368
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,970
It's not even fair.

369
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,220
You don't understand.

370
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,390
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.

371
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,980
God bless you, Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.

372
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,320
Now he's got Paulie as a partner.
Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

373
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,610
Trouble with a bill, he goes to Paulie.

374
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,120
Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy...

375
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,410
...he calls Paulie.
But now he has to pay Paulie...

376
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,450
...every week no matter what.

377
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,670
"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.
Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me. "

378
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,340
"The place got hit by lightning?
Fuck you, pay me. "

379
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:38,180
Also, Paulie could do anything.
Like run up bills on thejoint's credit.

380
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,010
And why not?
Nobody will pay for it anyway.

381
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,890
Take deliveries at the front door
and sell it out the back at a discount.

382
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,190
Take a $200 case of booze
and sell it for $100.

383
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,980
It doesn't matter. It's all profit.

384
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,990
Then finally, when there's nothing left...

385
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,200
...when you can't borrow
another buck from the bank...

386
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,040
...you bust thejoint out.
You light a match.

387
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,870
Do you need help reaching anything?

388
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,130
You look like you're
decorating a Christmas tree.

389
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,170
She's from the Five Towns.

390
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,760
Who?

391
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,590
The Jew broad. Diane.

392
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,020
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.

393
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,560
- No.
- No, what?

394
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,020
No, what? Who asked you anything?

395
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,360
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.

396
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,940
All right, what?

397
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,450
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.

398
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:48,540
You fucking believe that? In this day
and age? What is this world coming to?

399
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,710
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

400
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:59,050
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
So you come along for her friend.

401
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,470
See? I knew it. I knew it.

402
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,800
What the fuck is wrong with that?

403
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,140
- When is it?
- Tomorrow night.

404
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,770
I'm meeting Tuddy.

405
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,600
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.

406
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,400
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.

407
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,820
What did I ask you for? A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

408
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,700
I'm trying to bang this broad. Help me out.

409
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,080
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

410
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,700
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

411
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,330
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

412
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,670
You with your fucking mouth!

413
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,930
I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00
and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.

414
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,850
Did you have enough to eat?

415
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,060
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

416
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,890
Let me watch your figure.

417
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,230
I couldn't wait to go. I was ordering
dessert when they were eating dinner.

418
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,650
When they were having coffee,
I was asking for the check.

419
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,360
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

420
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,620
Joe, can we have the check?

421
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,240
What are you doing?

422
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,620
- I got to go.
- We just got here.

423
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,250
I got that thing.

424
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,870
We'll leave together.

425
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,750
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

426
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,300
I couldn't stand him.

427
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,590
I thought he was really obnoxious.
He kept fidgeting around.

428
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,100
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

429
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,150
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

430
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,940
- Ready?
- Lighten up.

431
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,690
We just got here. What are you doing?

432
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,030
Before it was time to go,
he was pushing me into the car...

433
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,200
...then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.

434
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,960
Diane and Tommy made us promise
to meet them again on Friday.

435
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,710
We agreed.

436
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,130
But when Friday came around,
Henry stood me up.

437
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,800
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

438
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,970
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.

439
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,430
We were a trio instead of a double date.

440
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,720
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

441
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,770
But I made Tommy take me
looking for him.

442
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,860
Tommy, what the fuck?

443
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,610
You got some nerve standing me up.

444
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,660
Nobody does that to me.

445
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,080
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some big shot?

446
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,040
I forgot. I thought it was next week.

447
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,670
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

448
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,210
We can talk about this.

449
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,300
Talk to you after what you just did to me?

450
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,590
Forget it.

451
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,220
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

452
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,890
Let me make it up to you.

453
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,520
I'll think about it.

454
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,110
I remember, she was screaming
on the street and I mean loud.

455
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,480
- But she looked good.
- I'll think about it.

456
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,070
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

457
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,700
She had these great eyes
just like Liz Taylor's.

458
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,490
Hello, Henry.

459
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,870
- Ready?
- Yeah.

460
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,950
Come on.

461
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,620
- Wait a minute.
- What?

462
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,630
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that-

463
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Mom.

464
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,010
Meet my friend, Henry Hill.

465
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,430
My daughter says you're half Jewish.

466
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,260
It's just the good half.

467
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,470
See you later.

468
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,770
You're leaving your car?

469
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,850
He watches the car for me.

470
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,440
It's easier than leaving it at a garage.

471
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,030
It's a lot quicker that way.

472
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,830
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

473
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,630
How are you doin'? What's up?
Here you go.

474
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,640
- How are you doin', Gino?
- Good. How are you?

475
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,770
Every time I come here,
I see you two. Don't you work?

476
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,820
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

477
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,030
Anthony, right in the front.

478
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,540
Anything you need, let me know.

479
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,220
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

480
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,400
You gave them $20 each.

481
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,200
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

482
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,610
- Where?
- Over there.

483
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,200
Thanks a lot, Tony.

484
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,250
- What do you do?
- What?

485
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,420
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.

486
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,380
They don't feel like you're in construction.

487
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,130
I'm a union delegate.

488
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,970
Ladies and gentlemen...

489
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:19,140
...the Copacabana is proud to present
the king of one-liners...

490
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,430
...Henry Youngman.

491
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,820
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

492
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,740
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

493
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,370
I said, "Where do you wanna go
for our anniversary?"

494
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,620
She said,
"Somewhere I've never been before. "

495
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,500
I said, "Try the kitchen. "

496
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,420
Dr. Wellsler is here.

497
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,040
Gave a guy six months to live.
Couldn't pay his bill.

498
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,050
Gave him another six months.

499
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,220
I love this crowd.

500
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,650
Air France made me.

501
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,200
We walked out with $420,000
without using a gun.

502
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,030
And we did the right thing.
We gave Paulie his tribute.

503
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,120
Sixty thousand.

504
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,750
It's going to be a good summer.

505
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,550
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

506
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,720
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps.

507
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:44,970
Check, sir.

508
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,690
No. You have to sign for it here.

509
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,230
Should I tip him?

510
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,700
- How are you?
- Okay. And you?

511
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,290
- Henry, this is Bruce.
- Good to meet you.

512
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,790
I'll see you around later.

513
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,760
Do you know him?

514
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,760
Yeah.

515
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,760
He lives across the street.

516
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,060
"Roses are red, my love

517
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,480
"Violets are blue

518
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,570
"Sugar is sweet, my love

519
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,740
"But not as sweet as you"

520
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,420
One night, Bobby Vinton sent us
champagne. There was nothing like it.

521
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,380
I didn't think there was
anything strange in any of this.

522
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,090
A 21-year-old kid with such connections.

523
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,090
He was an exciting guy.

524
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,140
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.

525
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,770
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.

526
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,190
He knew how to handle it.

527
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,780
Don't buy wigs that come off
at the wrong time.

528
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,950
Morrie's wigs don't come off!

529
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,870
Even underwater.

530
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,080
And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested
against hurricane winds.

531
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,920
Forget about money.
You can afford a Morrie wig.

532
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,960
Call me now!

533
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,880
Come in for a personalized fitting.

534
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,220
Morrie, Jimmy's waiting. You're past due.

535
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,230
I've been good to you.

536
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,600
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

537
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,980
Jimmy's being a ball breaker.

538
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,150
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

539
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,320
I never had to pay
the vigorish he demands.

540
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,780
What am I, a schmuck?

541
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,490
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

542
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,830
I didn't agree to three points above the vig.

543
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,910
What are you going to do?
Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?

544
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,460
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go!

545
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,330
Fuck him!

546
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,630
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

547
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,460
Did I ever bust his balls?

548
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,090
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

549
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,220
Don't call the cops. You're talking crazy.

550
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,180
You got money for that commercial!

551
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,770
You don't got my fucking money?

552
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,520
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

553
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,150
I'll fucking kill you!
Give me the money, cocksucker.

554
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,570
Pay me!

555
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,780
He'll pay, he'll pay.

556
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,910
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

557
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,740
You should be sorry. Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

558
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,910
You hear me? Give me the fucking money!

559
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,920
I'll give you... You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

560
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,800
Karen, slow down.

561
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,800
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

562
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,430
It's Karen.

563
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,440
What happened?

564
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,320
What happened? Are you all right?

565
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,200
Who did it?

566
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:32,080
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

567
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,750
He started to touch me. He grabbed me.

568
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,090
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

569
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,470
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

570
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,510
He pushed me out of the car.

571
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,770
You sure you're all right?

572
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,650
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

573
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,720
What do you want, fucko?

574
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,020
I swear on my mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

575
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,190
Don't shoot.

576
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,550
Hide this. Are you all right?
Are you all right?

577
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,430
I know there are women...

578
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,890
...who would have gotten out
the minute their boyfriend...

579
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,930
...gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.

580
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,060
I got to admit the truth: It turned me on.

581
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,070
Mazel tov!

582
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,690
Why don't you be like Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

583
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,110
He's settling down now. He's married.

584
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,990
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

585
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:18,530
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

586
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,090
It was like he had two families.

587
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,470
The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once, it was crazy.

588
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,970
Paulie and his brothers had lots
of sons and nephews.

589
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,470
Almost all of them were named
Peter or Paul.

590
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,520
It was unbelievable.

591
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,730
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

592
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,320
There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls there...

593
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,650
This is Marie.

594
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,110
...all married to girls named Marie.

595
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,610
She looks Italian.

596
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,370
And they named all their daughters Marie.

597
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:05,250
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

598
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,920
By the time I had met everybody,
I thought I was drunk.

599
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,380
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

600
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,300
Welcome to the family.

601
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,430
Sunday dinner?

602
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:24,810
So beautiful. I want to cry.

603
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,980
Here's something to help you get started.

604
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,410
- The bag. The bag.
- What bag?

605
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,290
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

606
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,880
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

607
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,330
He didn't call?

608
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,420
- He's with his friends.
- What kind of person doesn't call?

609
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,840
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

610
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,590
A grown-up would get you an apartment.

611
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,260
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

612
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,770
You're here a month and sometimes I know
he doesn't come home at all.

613
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,640
What kind of people are these?

614
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,850
- What do you want me to do?
- What can you do?

615
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,940
He's not Jewish. Did you know
what these people were like?

616
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,530
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

617
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,870
Daddy never went out at all, Ma!
Keep out of it!

618
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,330
You don't know how I feel!

619
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,540
How do you feel now? You don't
know where he is or who he's with!

620
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,830
He's with his friends! Dad!

621
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,500
Leave him alone. He's suffered enough.

622
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,340
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

623
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,520
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

624
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,310
We were worried! A married man does not
stay out like this!

625
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,610
Normal people don't act like this!

626
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,610
What's wrong with you?

627
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,740
You're not normal. She's right!
What's wrong with you?

628
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,410
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

629
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,790
What kind of people are they?

630
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,670
We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.

631
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,760
But the first time I realized how different...

632
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,220
...was when Mickey had a hostess party.

633
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,300
- Karen, where you from?
- Lawrence.

634
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,560
On the Island. Nice.

635
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,980
I'm from Miami. Ever been there?

636
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,770
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

637
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,230
Stop picking at that.

638
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,150
I'd like to smack his face.

639
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,860
The red-haired guy?

640
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,070
The guy's hands are all over me.

641
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,200
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off. "

642
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,700
She means it.

643
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,540
He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie-

644
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,710
How can you mention it? Vinnie'd kill him.

645
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,880
Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard,
then he'll be there for life.

646
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,630
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

647
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,390
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

648
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,640
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears...

649
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,730
...she has a heart attack and drops dead.

650
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:02,030
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

651
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,650
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.

652
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,490
Give me a break. She's drunk.

653
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,740
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

654
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,620
They had bad skin and wore too much
makeup. They didn't look very good.

655
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,380
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore...

656
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,170
...was thrown together and cheap.

657
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,880
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

658
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,680
She spends her life in a nightgown.

659
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,970
The woman is no angel, believe me.

660
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,390
They talked about their rotten kids...

661
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,600
...and about beating them
with broom handles and belts.

662
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,810
And the kids still didn't listen.

663
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,150
When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

664
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,820
I don't know if I could live like that!

665
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,200
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

666
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,500
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband-

667
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,790
Do you know why Jeannie's
husband went to the can?

668
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,250
Because he wanted to get away from her.

669
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:04,670
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

670
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,510
Unless they make themselves get caught.

671
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,300
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.

672
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,180
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

673
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,480
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car.

674
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:24,070
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

675
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,780
After a while, it got to be all normal.

676
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,790
None of it seemed like crimes.

677
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,120
Henry wasjust enterprising.

678
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:43,000
He and the guys made bucks
hustling while other guys...

679
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,340
...sat on their asses waiting for handouts.

680
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,840
Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,
just blue-collar guys...

681
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:55,810
The only way they could make real extra
money was to go out and cut corners.

682
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,480
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

683
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,570
Don't fucking move! Don't move!

684
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,580
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.

685
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,170
Did you see him give it right over?

686
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,670
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

687
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,680
We were all very close.

688
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,720
There were never any outsiders around.
Absolutely never.

689
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,770
Being together all the time made
everything seem all the more normal.

690
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,100
Police.

691
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:46,520
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

692
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,440
Would you read and sign it?

693
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,150
Anywhere?

694
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,860
We have to go through everything.

695
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,780
You want some coffee?

696
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,870
No coffee now, thanks.

697
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,410
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.

698
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,120
There was always a little harassment.

699
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,250
They wanted to talk to Henry
about this or that.

700
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,420
They'd make me sign
their subpoenas or warrants.

701
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,130
But mostly theyjust wanted a handout.

702
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,760
A few bucks to keep things quiet
no matter what they found.

703
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:25,400
I always asked if they wanted coffee.
Some wives, like Mickey Conway...

704
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,860
...used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

705
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:32,280
On her own floor!
That never made any sense to me.

706
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,610
It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

707
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,330
"Happy birthday to you"

708
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:49,170
We always did everything together
and were always in the same crowd.

709
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,800
Anniversaries, christenings.
We only went to each other's houses.

710
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,140
The women played cards.

711
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,140
When kids were born, Mickey and
Jimmy were the first at the hospital.

712
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,730
When we went to the Islands
or Vegas for vacation...

713
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,150
...we went together.

714
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,110
No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.

715
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,690
I began to be proud that my husband
was willing to risk his neck...

716
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,360
...to get us the little extras.

717
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,830
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

718
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,200
- Can't do it.
- Why not?

719
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,410
I just can't. I got something lined up.

720
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,750
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

721
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,590
- Pretty please?
- I can't. What do you want me to do?

722
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,220
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.

723
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,390
I need money to go shopping.

724
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,100
How much?

725
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,640
That much.

726
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,070
This much. Give me a kiss.

727
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,700
See you later.

728
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,450
All right.

729
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:08,710
"I always dreamed the boy I love
would come along

730
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,630
"And he'd be tall and handsome,
rich and strong"

731
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,110
Welcome home, Batts.

732
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,240
Hi there. How are you?

733
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:45,660
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

734
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,870
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

735
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,870
There's only one Irishman here.

736
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,790
It's a celebration.

737
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,880
- Top of the morning.
- It's good to be home.

738
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:02,220
This is my friend Jimmy.

739
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,810
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

740
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,930
Tommy. All dressed up.

741
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,390
All grown up and doing the town.

742
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,730
Forgot you were having a party for him.

743
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,190
Come here.

744
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,820
I'll say hello. How are you, Billy?

745
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,320
I haven't seen you in six years.

746
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,830
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

747
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,120
Watch the suit.

748
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:30,460
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

749
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,710
- Don't get too big on me.
- Just don't bust my balls.

750
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,130
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box. "

751
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,090
This kid was great.

752
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,600
I used to call him "Spitshine Tommy. "

753
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,730
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

754
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,520
He was the best. Made a lot of money.

755
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,570
No more shines.

756
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,980
No more shines.

757
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:01,900
You been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

758
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,030
I don't shine shoes anymore.

759
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:08,740
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

760
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,080
I'm only kidding with you.

761
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,500
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

762
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,790
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

763
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,760
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

764
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,880
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

765
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,590
I'm sorry, too.

766
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,310
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

767
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,230
Motherfucking mutt!

768
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,480
You fucking piece of shit!

769
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,730
Come on, come on!

770
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,780
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

771
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,240
You bought your fucking button!

772
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,570
- Don't get nervous.
- You motherfucker!

773
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,660
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!

774
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,160
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

775
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,790
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

776
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,340
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

777
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,050
Teach this kid a little fucking manners!
What's right is right.

778
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:05,430
- You understand what I'm saying?
- It's alright.

779
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:10,100
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

780
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,890
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

781
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,270
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.

782
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,360
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
- Okay.

783
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,190
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

784
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,110
No, have the drink with me.

785
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,780
The drinks are on the house.

786
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:32,740
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

787
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,460
Fucking break up my party.

788
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:46,050
You been away for six years.
It's different now.

789
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,470
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

790
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,930
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

791
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,390
- You're gonna get it.
- You understand?

792
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,690
Get the door!

793
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,170
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

794
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:19,670
Let's shoot him.

795
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,520
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

796
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,020
His crew'll be looking for him.

797
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,700
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

798
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:52,740
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

799
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,620
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

800
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,210
Go open your trunk.

801
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,220
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

802
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,770
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her.

803
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,400
Look who's here.

804
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,780
What happened?

805
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,780
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.

806
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,910
What happened to him?

807
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,790
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

808
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,080
You, too. How are you?

809
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,790
Why are you up so late?

810
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:44,960
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

811
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:49,670
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

812
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,890
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.

813
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,350
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

814
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,220
You go inside.

815
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,020
This stuff is like lead.

816
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,140
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

817
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,480
You haven't called. Where have you been?

818
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,440
I been working nights.

819
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,280
And tonight we were out late.

820
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,650
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

821
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,910
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

822
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,790
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay? Just for a while.

823
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,750
The poor thing.

824
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,250
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?

825
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:29,050
The paw.

826
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,300
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.

827
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,050
I got to hack it off.

828
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,470
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

829
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,560
I'll bring the knife back.

830
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,310
Delicious.

831
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,390
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

832
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,230
I do, almost every night.

833
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,320
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

834
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,900
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you! I want to be with you.

835
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,700
Settle down.

836
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,580
How's your friend Henry?

837
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,700
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

838
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,580
Talk. What are you quiet for?

839
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,170
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

840
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,670
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?

841
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:11,300
When we were kids,
the compares used to visit each other.

842
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:16,260
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.

843
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:20,810
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

844
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,730
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

845
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:29,310
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking! "

846
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,030
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

847
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,110
- Cornuto contento.
- That's it.

848
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:39,120
It means he's content to be a jerk.

849
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,200
He doesn't care who knows it.

850
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,040
Did Tommy tell you about my painting?

851
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,750
Look at this.

852
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,500
It's beautiful.

853
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,670
One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

854
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,220
One's facing east, the other west.

855
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:59,430
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got a nice head of white hair.

856
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:01,100
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

857
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,970
Looks like someone we know.

858
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,230
Without the beard. It's him.

859
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,110
It's him.

860
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,700
What the fuck is that?

861
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,330
For most of the guys,
killings were accepted.

862
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:27,460
Murder was the only way
everybody stayed in line.

863
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:30,880
You got out of line, you got whacked.
Everybody knew the rules.

864
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,260
Sometimes, even ifpeople didn't
get out of line, they got whacked.

865
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,220
Hits became a habit.
Guys would argue over nothing.

866
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,930
Before you knew it, one was dead.

867
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,260
They were shooting each other all the time.

868
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:47,940
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.

869
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,730
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.

870
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,650
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy killed a made guy.

871
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,910
Batts was part of the Gambino crew
and considered untouchable.

872
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,830
Before you touched a made guy,
you needed a good reason.

873
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,290
You had to get an okay...

874
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,870
...or you'd get whacked.

875
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,140
Saturday night was for wives, but...

876
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,350
...Friday night at the Copa
was for the girlfriends.

877
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,060
We saw Sammy Davis, Jr. You got to see
this show. What a performer!

878
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,440
He does impersonations.
It was like the real people!

879
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,610
Unbelievable. You could see how
a white girl could fall for him.

880
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,530
What?

881
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,910
Not me. But you could see how some
girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

882
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,830
So you condone that stuff.

883
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,710
Take it easy.

884
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,420
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

885
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:58,090
I don't mean me.

886
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:02,260
But, you know, he's got personality.

887
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,680
"Personality?"

888
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,020
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

889
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:11,640
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

890
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,020
I just said he was talented.

891
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,610
Just leave it alone now.

892
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,690
He's talented. Leave it at that.

893
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,030
"Pretend you don't see her, my heart

894
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:28,040
"Although she is coming

895
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,160
"Our way

896
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,790
"Pretend you don't need her

897
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:38,920
"My heart

898
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,130
"But smile and pretend

899
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,300
"To be gay

900
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,230
"It's too late for running

901
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,440
"My heart

902
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,650
"Chin up if the tears

903
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,990
"Start to fall

904
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,320
"Look somewhere above her

905
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,580
"Pretend you don't love her

906
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,710
"Pretend you don't see her

907
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,710
"At all"

908
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:00,290
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

909
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,900
What did you hear about that thing?

910
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,110
The Brooklyn thing?

911
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,820
The guy from downtown.

912
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,490
The guy from where Christie lived?

913
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,120
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

914
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,240
Know the guy I mean?

915
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,950
His name was Batts.

916
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,120
His people are driving everyone crazy
looking for him.

917
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:40,000
Nobody knows what happened.

918
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:44,130
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared.

919
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:49,300
Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

920
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,020
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

921
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,440
I want my money.

922
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,360
I want my money. He owes it.

923
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,910
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

924
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:22,000
- Paulie was talking about that.
- We must move it.

925
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,500
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

926
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,260
- It's been six months.
- We got to move it right away.

927
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:46,190
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

928
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,240
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny.

929
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:53,780
Here's a leg.

930
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,280
Here's a wing.

931
01:05:56,290 --> 01:06:00,750
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

932
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,580
Oh, that's so bad.

933
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,260
What happened to the car?

934
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,510
I hit a skunk, all right?

935
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,310
Go with your mother.

936
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,430
It's disgusting, Henry.

937
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:26,320
I set up Janice in an apartment
near The Suite.

938
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:29,230
That way I was able to stay over
a few nights a week.

939
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,400
My new antique lamp.

940
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:33,660
Karen was home with the kids.
She never asked questions.

941
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,780
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

942
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,410
Looks like Roma.

943
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,330
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

944
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,540
Come see my bedroom.

945
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:48,420
- Tommy, will you take him?
- I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

946
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,260
Love that crystal ball or what?

947
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,680
This is where we spend most of our time.

948
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,980
I love the floral arrangements.

949
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,270
French.

950
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,280
Janice and I were having so much fun,
she started screwing up at work.

951
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,400
I had to straighten out her boss.

952
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,990
Janice can do what she wants to do!

953
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,530
Got it?

954
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:20,740
Just try to run. Hang up once more
and you'll deal with me!

955
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,290
Get off of her.

956
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,630
You're an animal.

957
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:47,060
Spider, on your way here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

958
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,820
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm starving.

959
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,030
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?

960
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,410
Do I stutter? I play those.

961
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,660
What am I? A mirage?

962
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,790
Where's my fucking drink?

963
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,710
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.

964
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,710
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider. "

965
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,720
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

966
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:19,260
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider. "

967
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,180
- I thought it was Henry.
- You're a stuttering fuck.

968
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,810
You said, "I'm all right, Spider. "

969
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,690
You ain't all right.

970
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:30,060
No, you said you were all right.

971
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:32,940
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

972
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,450
You been doing this all night to me,
motherfucker!

973
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,320
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

974
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:43,290
Get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you prick!

975
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,580
You walk like "Stepin Fetchit. "

976
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:47,920
For everybody else you run.

977
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:51,130
Run for me!
Dance the fucking drink back here!

978
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:53,710
What's that Bogart movie?

979
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,630
- Where he played a cowboy.
- The Oklahoma Kid.

980
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,010
Oklahoma Kid. Shane?
Oklahoma Kid, that's me.

981
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,850
You fucking varmint. Dance!

982
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,470
Yahoo, motherfucker!

983
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,850
Round up those fucking wagons.

984
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,940
Now he's moving.

985
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,660
Shot in the foot.

986
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:23,580
He's fine. So he got shot in the foot.
Big fucking deal.

987
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:25,160
Get a towel.

988
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:26,790
Nice fucking game.

989
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:32,460
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

990
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,380
Take him to the doctor down the street.

991
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:38,380
Bones are all shattered.

992
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:40,130
Don't get me upset.

993
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,510
Don't make a big fucking thing
out of it, Spider!

994
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,850
You trying to make me think
what I did here.

995
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,810
It was an accident.

996
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,810
Little fucking actor.

997
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,110
- You in?
- I'm in.

998
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,230
- Eight hundred.
- Eight hundred?

999
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,860
You haven't been home in two weeks!
You're not going out tonight!

1000
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:03,120
Will you grow up! I'm still going to go out!

1001
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,330
Not without your car keys.

1002
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:07,740
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1003
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,750
Yes! Something's going on!

1004
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,790
- Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that!
- No!

1005
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,210
I look in your face and I know you're lying!

1006
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:21,260
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up!

1007
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:22,720
Out of my life!

1008
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:25,640
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.

1009
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,430
- You're a lousy bastard!
- You got a problem.

1010
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:32,310
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1011
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,360
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

1012
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,290
Spider, what's your rush?

1013
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:52,830
Thank you.

1014
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:57,380
Spider, that bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1015
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,840
Next thing you know he'll have
one of these fucking walkers.

1016
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,890
But you can still dance.

1017
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:09,470
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter.

1018
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,480
Tell the truth. You want sympathy.

1019
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,230
Go fuck yourself, Tommy.

1020
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:20,780
I didn't hear right.

1021
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,650
I can't believe what I heard.

1022
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:24,110
This is for you.

1023
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,370
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.

1024
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,830
Good. Don't take shit from nobody.

1025
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,620
He shoots him in the foot and
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1026
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,960
Tommy, you going to let this
fucking punk get away with that?

1027
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:42,090
What's this world coming to?

1028
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:49,100
That's what the fucking world's coming to.

1029
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,180
- How's that?
- What is wrong with you?

1030
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:54,730
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?

1031
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:58,310
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?

1032
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,860
How do I know if you're kidding?

1033
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,320
I'm kidding with you
and you fucking shoot the guy?

1034
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,570
He's dead.

1035
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,280
Good shot. I'm a good shot.

1036
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:13,410
- Hard to miss at this distance.
- You got a problem with what I did?

1037
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,500
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1038
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,630
Stupid bastard! I can't believe you.

1039
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:24,340
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1040
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:28,510
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1041
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,310
Not the first hole I dug.
Where are the shovels?

1042
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,610
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.

1043
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:43,510
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1044
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,310
I want to talk to you!

1045
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:48,510
You keep away from my husband,
you hear me?

1046
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:52,310
Open the door!

1047
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,410
Answer me!

1048
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,710
I'll tell everyone who walks in here...

1049
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:01,710
...that in 2R, Rossi, 
you are nothing but a whore!

1050
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:03,110
Superintendent?

1051
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:05,910
I want you to know you have a whore...

1052
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,510
...living in 2R!

1053
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:10,310
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1054
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:14,110
He's my husband! 
Get your own goddamn man!

1055
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,110
Wake up, Henry.

1056
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,310
What are you doing?

1057
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,610
Karen, are you crazy?

1058
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:39,210
I am crazy.

1059
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:42,710
And I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1060
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:47,510
Karen, take it easy.

1061
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:53,310
Do you love her?

1062
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:55,710
Do you?

1063
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:58,110
Do you?

1064
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:03,510
I love you. You know I love you.

1065
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:06,010
You don't.

1066
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,610
No, you don't.

1067
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:13,010
Be careful, baby. Don't.

1068
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:17,310
But still I couldn't hurt him. 
How could I hurt him?

1069
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:20,110
I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.

1070
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,810
The truth was...

1071
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:24,110
...no matter how bad I felt...

1072
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:27,210
...I was still very attracted to him.

1073
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:30,710
Why give him to someone else?

1074
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:32,710
Why should she win?

1075
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,110
Just put it down. 
You know I love you, don't you?

1076
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,310
You're all I want, Karen.

1077
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,810
Please put the gun down.

1078
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:50,510
Baby, come on.

1079
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:07,310
What are you, fucking crazy?

1080
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:11,510
I got enough to worry about 
getting whacked on the street!

1081
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:14,610
I got to fucking come home... for this?

1082
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,310
I should fucking kill you!

1083
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,510
- How does it feel? 
- I'm sorry.

1084
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,110
How does it feel, Karen?

1085
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:43,110
I'm sorry!

1086
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:52,110
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1087
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:55,910
- Looking good. 
- Thank you. Good to see you.

1088
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,410
- Hi, Paulie! 
- Hi, honey. How are you?

1089
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:02,010
- Go get some cigarettes, okay? 
- Sure.

1090
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,810
- Any of you need anything? 
- I'm all right.

1091
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:09,010
- You want anything to drink? A beer? 
- No, this...

1092
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:11,510
- Chinese food? 
- No, come on, sit down.

1093
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:20,310
Karen came to the house.

1094
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,510
She's very upset.

1095
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:24,710
You got to straighten this out.

1096
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:28,010
We got to have calm now. 
We don't know what she'll do.

1097
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:30,510
She's hysterical. Very excited.

1098
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:34,510
She's wild. And you got to take it easy. 
You got children.

1099
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:39,110
I'm not saying to go back to her right now, 
but you got to go back.

1100
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:41,410
You got to keep up appearances.

1101
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:44,310
The two of them come 
to my house every day.

1102
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:46,210
I can't have it.

1103
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:49,710
I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it.

1104
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:53,010
Nobody says you can't do what you want.

1105
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:57,010
We all know that. This is what it is. 
We know what it is.

1106
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:01,310
You have to do the right thing. 
You have to go home to the family.

1107
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,910
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1108
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:06,510
You got to go home. Smarten up.

1109
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:10,510
I'll talk to Karen.

1110
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:14,010
I'll straighten this out. 
I know just what to say to her.

1111
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:19,410
I'll say you'll go back to her 
and it'll be like when you first got married.

1112
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:22,110
You'll romance her. It'll be beautiful.

1113
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:24,010
I know how to talk to her.

1114
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:28,010
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa 
this weekend to pick up something for me.

1115
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,810
Instead, you'll go with Jimmy.

1116
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,310
You come with me.

1117
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:33,110
Have a good time.

1118
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,910
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1119
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,810
We'll have a good time.

1120
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:40,510
When you come back, 
you'll go back to Karen.

1121
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:43,310
Please, there's no other way.

1122
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,710
No divorce. We're not animali.

1123
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:48,810
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1124
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,810
She'll kill him, but not divorce him.

1125
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,610
You going to pay us?

1126
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,510
Give us the fucking money!

1127
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:09,610
I can't.

1128
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:13,810
Let's go.

1129
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:24,910
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.

1130
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:28,210
Lions? I ain't going near any lions!

1131
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:30,110
Throw him over the moat.

1132
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,010
I'll get the money!

1133
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:37,010
They must really feed each other to the 
lions, 'cause he gave the money right up.

1134
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:38,510
I'll get the money.

1135
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:41,310
We spent the rest of the weekend 
at the track.

1136
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:43,010
They mean business.

1137
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:45,810
Then, I couldn't believe what happened.

1138
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:48,810
When we got home, 
we were all over the newspaper.

1139
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:51,910
At first I didn't even know why 
we got picked up.

1140
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,710
Then I found out the guy we roughed up...

1141
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,810
...had a sister working as a typist 
for the FBl.

1142
01:18:58,010 --> 01:19:00,810
I couldn't believe it. Of all people.

1143
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:04,110
She gave up everybody. 
Jimmy, me. Even her brother.

1144
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:08,510
It took thejury six hours 
to bring us in guilty.

1145
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,710
The judge gave us ten years, 
like he was giving away candy.

1146
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:14,010
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1147
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,060
You will now be turned over...

1148
01:19:17,095 --> 01:19:19,110
...to the U.S. Attorney General.

1149
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,910
Toast, guys. Good trip, 
good life. Get out soon.

1150
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:29,610
Good trip, sweetheart.

1151
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:34,610
We'll watch the home front.

1152
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:38,610
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1153
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:42,210
Motherfuck them every chance you get.

1154
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:50,910
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1155
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:04,910
Now take me to jail.

1156
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:12,210
In prison, dinner was always a big thing.

1157
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:16,110
We had a pasta course, 
then we had a meat or a fish.

1158
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:19,410
Paulie did the prep work. 
He was doing a year for contempt...

1159
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:22,110
...and had a wonderful system for garlic.

1160
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:25,210
He used a razor and sliced it so thin...

1161
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:28,410
...it would liquify in the pan 
with a little oil.

1162
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:30,410
It was a very good system.

1163
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:33,310
Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.

1164
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:35,110
Get that smell?

1165
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:39,510
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs: 
veal, beef, and pork.

1166
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:41,710
You got to have pork.

1167
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,010
That's the flavor.

1168
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:48,210
I felt he used too many onions, 
but it was still a very good sauce.

1169
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,810
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.

1170
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,410
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1171
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:58,010
- There are only three small onions. 
- Three onions? How many tomatoes?

1172
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:00,810
- Two big cans. 
- You don't need three onions.

1173
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:03,075
Johnny Dio did the meat.

1174
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:06,010
We had no broiler, 
so he did everything in pans.

1175
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:09,410
It smelled up thejoint and 
the hacks used to die...

1176
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:11,610
...but he cooked a great steak.

1177
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:14,310
- How do you like yours? 
- Medium rare.

1178
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,210
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1179
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:21,210
When you think of prison 
you get pictures in your mind...

1180
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:25,210
...of all those old movies with rows 
and rows of guys behind bars.

1181
01:21:25,245 --> 01:21:27,410
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.

1182
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:31,510
It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy, 
who was doing his time in Atlanta.

1183
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:33,410
Give me two steaks.

1184
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:40,010
Everyone else in the joint was doing 
real time, all together, living like pigs.

1185
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:43,010
But we lived alone. We owned the joint.

1186
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:46,710
We batted them sons of bitches. 
You couldn't recognize them.

1187
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:48,110
They deserved it.

1188
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:51,910
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe 
wouldn't rat on the guys we did.

1189
01:21:51,945 --> 01:21:54,610
People used to be able 
to leave their doors open.

1190
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:58,410
Sorry it took so long. 
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.

1191
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:02,010
- We have to take care of that bastard. 
- I took care of him.

1192
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:03,510
What'd you bring?

1193
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:05,410
Some bread.

1194
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,310
I got peppers and onions.

1195
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:10,910
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1196
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:12,210
What else?

1197
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:13,810
- Scotch. 
- Nice.

1198
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,310
- Red wine. 
- Okay.

1199
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:19,410
- Now we can eat. 
- Some white, too.

1200
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:24,010
Beautiful. Okay, boys, let's eat. 
Come on, Johnny, Vinnie.

1201
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:29,310
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches. 
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1202
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:37,510
Read 'em and weep.

1203
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:41,710
What are you doing?

1204
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:53,310
I'll catch you guys later.

1205
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,610
Going for a walk in the park?

1206
01:22:58,110 --> 01:23:00,310
I'll catch you next week. Thanks.

1207
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:06,910
- Is there any more? 
- No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1208
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:23,910
You girls stay right here.

1209
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:26,710
- Hold hands. 
- Go right up front.

1210
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:45,410
What?

1211
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:47,610
I saw her name on the register.

1212
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:49,810
Want her to visit you?

1213
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:53,310
Let her stay up all night crying 
and writing to the parole board.

1214
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:56,610
What am I doing here? 
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1215
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:59,110
I can't stop people from visiting me.

1216
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:02,310
Let her sneak this stuff 
in for you every week.

1217
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:05,710
Let her fight these bastards every week!

1218
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:08,010
Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1219
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:09,510
I'm sorry.

1220
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:12,410
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1221
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:16,010
Will you stop it?

1222
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:18,310
- Let her do it! 
- Stop it!

1223
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:29,510
Nobody's helping me. I am all alone.

1224
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:33,310
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1225
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:36,910
I asked your friend Remo 
for the money he owes you.

1226
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:42,110
He told me to take the kids down 
to the police station and get on welfare.

1227
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,110
It's going to be okay.

1228
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:48,310
I've never seen Paulie since he got out. 
I never see anyone.

1229
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:51,710
That's what happens when you go away.

1230
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:56,110
We're on our own. Forget everybody else. 
Forget Paulie.

1231
01:24:56,710 --> 01:25:00,410
As long as he's on parole 
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1232
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:05,610
- I can't do it. 
- Yes, you can.

1233
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:08,210
All I need is for you to bring me this stuff.

1234
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:11,210
A guy in here from Pittsburgh 
will help me move it.

1235
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:14,110
In a month we'll be fine. 
We won't need anybody.

1236
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:15,510
I'm afraid.

1237
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,510
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1238
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:19,610
He is not helping us out.

1239
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:22,210
Is he putting any food on the table?

1240
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:25,710
We've got to help each other.

1241
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:29,310
We got to be really, 
really careful while we do it.

1242
01:25:33,710 --> 01:25:36,010
I don't want to hear about her anymore.

1243
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:37,110
Never.

1244
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:08,010
- We missed you. 
- Are you here to stay?

1245
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:11,810
Did you see our pictures? 
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1246
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,410
I did the sun.

1247
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:17,010
My chorus concert is in two weeks. 
Are you coming?

1248
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,910
Do you like the house?

1249
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,310
- Get packed. We're moving out. 
- With what?

1250
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:27,910
Don't worry. 
Just start looking for a new house.

1251
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:31,210
I got to go to Pittsburgh. 
Those guys owe me $15,000.

1252
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:33,610
We'll be okay. I got things lined up.

1253
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,610
Pittsburgh? You have to see 
your parole officer.

1254
01:26:36,645 --> 01:26:38,210
Don't worry about it.

1255
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:41,910
Everything will be fine. 
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?

1256
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:54,310
What do you want?

1257
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,810
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1258
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:03,410
You look good. 
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1259
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,275
I don't want any more of that shit.

1260
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:10,910
- What are you talking about? 
- Just stay away from the garbage.

1261
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:13,910
Inside, you did what you had to do.

1262
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:17,110
I'm talking about now. From here and now.

1263
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:20,910
- Why would I get into that? 
- Don't make a jerk of me.

1264
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:22,510
Just don't do it.

1265
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:24,510
Don't do it.

1266
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:29,210
I want to talk about Jimmy. 
Watch out for him.

1267
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:32,510
He's a good earner, 
but he takes too many chances.

1268
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:35,010
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.

1269
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:38,810
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy. 
He's got too much to prove.

1270
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:42,810
- You got to watch out for them. 
- I only use them for certain things.

1271
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:45,810
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.

1272
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:50,310
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll 
die in prison. I don't need that.

1273
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:54,410
So I'm warning everybody. 
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1274
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:59,810
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello 
to some fuck who was selling junk.

1275
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:02,710
That won't happen to me, understand?

1276
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:05,410
You're out early because I got you a job.

1277
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:07,210
I don't need this heat.

1278
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:09,910
You see anybody with shit you tell me.

1279
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:12,510
Anybody.

1280
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:14,210
- All right. 
- Yeah?

1281
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:16,010
Yeah. Of course.

1282
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:26,610
It took me a week of sneaking around 
to unload the Pittsburgh stuff.

1283
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:29,210
But when I did, it was a real score.

1284
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:32,210
I used Sandy's place to mix the stuff.

1285
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:37,310
Even with Sandy snorting more than she 
mixed, I saw this was a good business.

1286
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:40,210
I made $12,000 in my second week.

1287
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:44,010
I had a down payment on my house 
and things were rolling.

1288
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:47,610
All I had to do was once in a while 
tell Sandy I loved her.

1289
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:53,610
It was perfect.

1290
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:58,210
As long as I got the stuff from Pittsburgh, 
Paulie would never find out.

1291
01:28:58,510 --> 01:29:02,310
Within a couple of weeks 
it got so big I needed some help.

1292
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:05,610
I got Jimmy and Tommy 
to come in with me.

1293
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:07,710
It's fucking great.

1294
01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:16,510
You bring your pay slips?

1295
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:22,310
Four and a half months of dirt.

1296
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:24,810
- It's so good. 
- I did it.

1297
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:28,610
- Do you love it? 
- It's wonderful.

1298
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:32,910
This we had to have made special. 
Go ahead, sit in it.

1299
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,810
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1300
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:37,510
Okay, ready?

1301
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:40,110
Watch the wall with the rock.

1302
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:50,010
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1303
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:57,310
This was imported. It came in two pieces. 
Do you believe what they can do?

1304
01:29:57,510 --> 01:30:00,710
- Nice, huh? 
- Come here. Did you and Jimmy talk?

1305
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:03,410
He's looking into everything.

1306
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:06,510
It'll make the Air France hold 
look like peanuts.

1307
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:07,810
Come on.

1308
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:10,110
- He'll do it, right? 
- I told you.

1309
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:13,910
He's looking into it. 
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1310
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:17,910
Do you understand? 
There's millions in there.

1311
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:21,810
I've been cultivating this 
son of a bitch for two years.

1312
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:25,910
He owes me 20 grand. Once in a lifetime. 
I could retire.

1313
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:30,110
No more nut every week. 
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1314
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:31,810
Let's get a drink.

1315
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:35,310
These are the guys Jimmy put together 
for what turned out to be...

1316
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:39,410
...the biggest heist in American history. 
The Lufthansa heist.

1317
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:45,010
Tommy and Carbone would grab the guard 
and make him get us in the front door.

1318
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:50,310
Frenchy and Joe Buddha 
had to round up the workers.

1319
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:55,010
Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them 
tied up and away from the alarms.

1320
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:57,810
Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

1321
01:30:58,010 --> 01:31:01,710
He used to play guitar at the lounge. 
Everybody loved Stacks.

1322
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:04,110
He was supposed to steal the panel truck...

1323
01:31:04,210 --> 01:31:07,510
...and afterwards compact it 
by a friend of ours in Jersey.

1324
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:10,010
Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

1325
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:12,110
Have a drink and shut up.

1326
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:14,110
Just because he set this up...

1327
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:18,110
...he bugged Jimmy for an advance 
on the money we were going to steal.

1328
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:22,010
He didn't mean anything by it. 
That'sjust the way he was.

1329
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:33,110
I had everyone working for me. 
Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.

1330
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:37,310
Have a good flight?

1331
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:40,110
I hate Pittsburgh. They're such creeps.

1332
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:42,210
They're not that bad.

1333
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:45,210
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1334
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:48,010
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1335
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:51,210
No, that was my sister's. This is Deirdra's.

1336
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:53,310
Big yawn.

1337
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,210
She looks like you.

1338
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,810
That's what the stewardess said.

1339
01:32:10,910 --> 01:32:12,410
Take it easy.

1340
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:15,110
Give me a break. You got plenty.

1341
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:19,110
You got all day. Let's make it last, 
all right? Take it easy.

1342
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:21,510
- I got to go. 
- Where are you going?

1343
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:25,910
Don't start. You know I got to go 
do this thing. Where are my keys?

1344
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,310
Over there.

1345
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:32,410
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen. 
Why do you think I got you a dishwasher?

1346
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:33,910
Fucks up my nails.

1347
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:35,910
You got to be smart.

1348
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:39,410
There's enough powder here 
to put us away forever.

1349
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:40,810
Loosen up.

1350
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:42,610
What are you doing?

1351
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:47,110
You don't have to go anywhere.

1352
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:49,210
Make them wait.

1353
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:02,210
Nobody knows for sure how much 
was taken in the pre-dawn raid...

1354
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,110
...at the Lufthansa cargo terminal 
at Kennedy Airport.

1355
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:08,710
The FBI says $2,000,000, 
Port Authority Police say $4,000,000.

1356
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:16,210
Those sons of bitches!

1357
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:18,810
...from the scene of the heist at JFK.

1358
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:22,810
It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest 
this town has ever seen.

1359
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:26,710
Come here, you! Come here!

1360
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:30,210
Look at this genius. This genius!

1361
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:36,610
Merry Christmas, Jimmy!

1362
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:43,810
- Who's this? 
- This is my wife.

1363
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:48,310
Come here. I want to show you something, 
Jimmy.

1364
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:55,010
Isn't she gorgeous? I bought it 
for my wife. It's a coupe. I love that car.

1365
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:01,010
What did I tell you? 
I talked to you, didn't I?

1366
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:05,310
Didn't I say not to go buy anything 
for a while? The fucking car?

1367
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:10,110
It's a wedding gift from my mother. 
It's under her name. I just got married.

1368
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:13,210
- I love that car. 
- Excuse me for a second.

1369
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:15,710
- I just got married. 
- Are you nuts?

1370
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:18,710
- Why are you getting excited? 
- Are you stupid?

1371
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:22,310
We got a million fucking bulls out there. 
Everyone's watching us.

1372
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:25,510
It's under my mother's name. 
It's a wedding gift.

1373
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:28,710
I don't give a fuck. 
Didn't you hear what I said?

1374
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:32,910
Don't buy anything. Don't get anything. 
What's the matter with you?

1375
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:35,675
What are you getting excited for?

1376
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:38,710
Because you're going to get us all pinched.

1377
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:41,910
- What's the matter with you? 
- I apologize.

1378
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:45,710
- I'm sorry. 
- What's the matter with you?

1379
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:54,210
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1380
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,810
It's under my mother's name.

1381
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:59,410
What'd you say? You being a wise guy?

1382
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:02,810
- I'm sorry. I apologize. 
- What did I tell you?

1383
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:06,310
What did I tell you? 
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1384
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:08,110
You don't buy anything!

1385
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:09,710
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1386
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:15,010
The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.

1387
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:25,010
I can't believe this. Are you stupid?

1388
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:26,210
Excuse me.

1389
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:28,810
- Take it off. 
- Why?

1390
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:32,410
Take it off!

1391
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:37,510
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big 
or attract attention?

1392
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:40,910
One guy gets a Caddy 
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1393
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:42,375
I'll return it.

1394
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:47,310
Bring it back where you got it. Get it out 
of here. Understand? Get it out of here!

1395
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:01,310
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1396
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:07,310
I'm going to see Stacks. 
Don't you look at anybody or I'll kill you.

1397
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:11,610
He's so jealous. If I even look 
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1398
01:36:12,010 --> 01:36:13,310
That's great.

1399
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:17,110
I tell them all not to attract attention. 
What do they do?

1400
01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:22,310
I've been looking all over for you.

1401
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:25,110
Listen, I need the money.

1402
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:28,910
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas. 
- I need the money.

1403
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:31,710
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1404
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:34,910
- I did what I had to do. 
- Not tonight, Morrie.

1405
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:37,210
I did my caper. He owes me.

1406
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:41,910
Everyone's flashing stuff. They got money. 
I'm wearing the same shit.

1407
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:45,110
They're wearing it. I got to talk to him.

1408
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:49,710
I got 500 grand coming to me.

1409
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:53,110
The biggest bundle he made in his life.

1410
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:55,610
I'll go talk to him. Go have a drink.

1411
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:58,110
- I'll talk to him. 
- It's poison in my eyes.

1412
01:36:58,210 --> 01:37:00,710
- Morris, are you all right? 
- No, I'm not.

1413
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:10,410
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1414
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:14,910
We did it!

1415
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:21,910
- Who is it? 
- It's me.

1416
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:24,010
Pete? One second.

1417
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:28,710
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did. 
Don't be a moron with the money.

1418
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:32,510
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1419
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:36,110
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1420
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:40,710
- What do you think, Mommy? 
- I love them all.

1421
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:43,110
I love the gold outfit.

1422
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:45,110
- Merry Christmas. 
- Thank you.

1423
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:47,610
And? And?

1424
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:49,910
Happy Hanukkah.

1425
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:53,810
- Very funny. 
- Go get yourself something nice.

1426
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:06,810
Lufthansa should have been 
our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.

1427
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:10,810
Six million in cash. 
More than enough to go around.

1428
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:21,810
Yo, Stacks!

1429
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:23,610
Open up!

1430
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:34,910
What's with you? He ain't ready. 
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1431
01:38:35,110 --> 01:38:38,310
- You didn't bring any coffee? 
- Do I look like a caterer?

1432
01:38:38,410 --> 01:38:41,110
Frankie will make coffee. Make coffee.

1433
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:46,910
Thought you'd have a bitch in here.

1434
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:49,310
I did. Where the fuck is she?

1435
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:53,310
Always got these hot books around 
or a bitch.

1436
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:54,810
What time is it?

1437
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:58,910
- It's 11:30. We were to be there by 9:00. 
- I'll be ready in a minute.

1438
01:38:59,110 --> 01:39:02,710
You're always fucking late. 
You'd be late for your own funeral.

1439
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:11,610
What are you looking at? 
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1440
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:19,610
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke. 
A joke. Put the fucking pot down.

1441
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:41,510
Stacks was always crazy.

1442
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:45,710
Instead of getting rid of the truck 
as he was supposed to, he got stoned...

1443
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:50,410
...went to his girlfriend's, and by the time 
he woke up, the cops had found the truck.

1444
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:52,510
It was all over the television.

1445
01:39:52,810 --> 01:39:55,710
They even said they got 
prints off the wheel.

1446
01:39:56,510 --> 01:39:59,810
It wasjust a matter of time 
before they got to Stacks.

1447
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:13,410
I got to talk to you.

1448
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:16,510
- Have a drink. 
- Have a drink. Come on.

1449
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:20,910
Have a drink. What are you doing? 
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1450
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:24,110
I still have to talk to you.

1451
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:28,110
- What happened with Stacks? 
- Don't worry about that.

1452
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:32,210
- There's feds all over the place. 
- So what? Where are they going to go?

1453
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:34,710
- It's in the papers. 
- He's worried.

1454
01:40:35,710 --> 01:40:37,510
What are you worried about?

1455
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:41,110
The television and the newspapers. 
All the shit's out there.

1456
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:44,510
- What are you worried about? 
- You worry too much.

1457
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:48,010
Everything is beautiful. 
Didn't you tell him?

1458
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:49,710
Not yet.

1459
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,710
- What? 
- Guess what?

1460
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:54,810
They are going to make him.

1461
01:40:56,210 --> 01:40:58,410
Paulie's going to make you?

1462
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:02,910
They opened up the books. 
Paulie got the okay.

1463
01:41:03,110 --> 01:41:05,710
Can you believe that? This Guinea bastard.

1464
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:10,710
He's getting made. We'll work for 
this guy one day. He'll be a boss.

1465
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:13,810
I can't believe it.

1466
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:16,210
I'm happy for you. Congratulations.

1467
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:18,410
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1468
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:21,310
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.

1469
01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:23,210
Can I talk to you a second?

1470
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:26,410
I masterminded the whole thing, 
I'm left with dick.

1471
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:30,110
They'd be up a creek if not for me. 
Fuck him! I want my money.

1472
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:34,510
I want my money! I've had it up to here! 
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1473
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:38,410
- Fuck him! I want my money! 
- Good. Go tell him.

1474
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:43,010
Now will you keep you mouth shut?

1475
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:49,310
Morrie, you'll get your money. 
You just got to stop busting balls.

1476
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:51,610
All right. You hear me?

1477
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:54,110
Everything's going to be fine.

1478
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:06,810
"Oh, Henry boy, the pipes, 
the pipes are calling"

1479
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:11,510
Half Mick, half Guinea? 
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1480
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:15,210
"And down the glen, 
the glen and down the mountainside

1481
01:42:24,610 --> 01:42:26,310
"The summer's gone

1482
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:28,710
"And all the roses dying"

1483
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:57,110
I could see for the first time 
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

1484
01:42:57,210 --> 01:43:00,710
His mind was going in eight 
different directions at once.

1485
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:05,110
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1486
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:07,010
Morrie? Him?

1487
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:10,410
That's when I knew Jimmy 
was going to whack Morrie.

1488
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:15,210
That's how it happens. That's how fast 
it takes for a guy to get whacked.

1489
01:43:15,410 --> 01:43:17,810
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1490
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:21,610
He's always acting like a jerk. 
Nobody listens to what he says.

1491
01:43:21,710 --> 01:43:24,710
Nobody cares what he says, 
he talks so much.

1492
01:43:25,210 --> 01:43:27,610
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1493
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,610
- Okay? 
- All right.

1494
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:34,910
Start like this. Sorry. 
Did I get you in the eye?

1495
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:36,910
Stop breaking my balls.

1496
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:39,410
I was just stalling for time.

1497
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:44,160
I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock 
to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

1498
01:43:44,195 --> 01:43:48,410
But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew, 
I was going along with the program.

1499
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:51,910
I pulled out his hair. I bit him. 
He's out cold.

1500
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:56,610
I'm enraged. 
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1501
01:43:56,810 --> 01:43:59,410
I walk away. We start to go in this joint.

1502
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:03,310
I don't want to turn around. 
Jimmy's doing this to me.

1503
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:05,610
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1504
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:10,110
I don't want to turn around. He picks up 
his fucking head, he says, "Ah... "

1505
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:12,610
I said, "Don't say it! "

1506
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:18,510
"Jerkoff! "

1507
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:24,510
What are you going to do? What? 
I fucking fly at him!

1508
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:28,210
I got him and I'm banging his head, 
banging his fucking face.

1509
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:33,010
I'm pulling his hair out of his head. 
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1510
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:36,210
He's laying there full of fucking blood. 
I'm out of breath.

1511
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:38,610
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1512
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:41,910
It was a load off my mind.

1513
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:46,110
He never knew how close he'd come 
to getting killed.

1514
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:49,310
Even if I told him he would 
have never believed me.

1515
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:55,710
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now? 
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1516
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:58,610
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.

1517
01:44:58,810 --> 01:45:01,510
I've never met a ball buster like you.

1518
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:04,110
Who loves you more than I do?

1519
01:45:04,610 --> 01:45:08,110
- I'd do anything for you. 
- Except stop busting my balls.

1520
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:11,410
- Let's go have coffee. 
- Want to go to the diner?

1521
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:13,710
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1522
01:45:13,810 --> 01:45:17,410
- Which diner? 
- Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1523
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:19,410
- They got danishes? 
- They got everything.

1524
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:22,210
Let's pick up some danishes for Belle.

1525
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:27,210
Hear about the points we were shaving 
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio-

1526
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:36,910
I thought he'd never shut up.

1527
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:38,510
What a pain in the ass.

1528
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:41,610
- What'll we do with him? 
- Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1529
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:43,610
Call me when you're through.

1530
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:46,010
- Frank, let's chop him up. 
- All right.

1531
01:45:46,510 --> 01:45:50,110
- Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker? 
- You said chop him up.

1532
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:52,410
At Charlie's, not here!

1533
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:57,310
Come on, what are you doing? 
Get out of here.

1534
01:45:57,410 --> 01:45:59,810
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1535
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:01,510
The car's cold.

1536
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:04,910
Get out of here! What, warm it up? 
Get out of here!

1537
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,610
- Who is it? 
- It's Belle. Open up.

1538
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:10,910
It's Belle. Let me in.

1539
01:46:11,210 --> 01:46:15,110
Morris didn't come home. He's missing. 
I know something's happened.

1540
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:16,510
Calm down.

1541
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:19,410
He's missing! I know something happened.

1542
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:21,810
He's probably drunk and fell asleep 
somewhere.

1543
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:25,510
In 27 years he's never been 
away all night without calling.

1544
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:28,210
Something's happened. I know you know.

1545
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:31,710
Let me get changed. 
I'll take you home then look for him.

1546
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:34,610
I've been home! I've been on the phone-

1547
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:36,410
He's playing cards.

1548
01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:41,710
- What'll I tell Belle? 
- Who gives a fuck?

1549
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:45,610
Tell her he ran off with some broad. 
What do you care?

1550
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:48,210
- Watch this. 
- Don't fuck with them.

1551
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:50,310
I'll bust their fucking balls.

1552
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:53,110
Don't give them the satisfaction, the fucks.

1553
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:58,110
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1554
01:46:59,410 --> 01:47:01,210
Keep them up all night.

1555
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:03,510
I'll see you later.

1556
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:56,610
Jimmy was cutting every link 
between himself and the robbery...

1557
01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:59,010
...but it had nothing to do with me.

1558
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:13,110
I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me 
some Christmas money.

1559
01:48:14,610 --> 01:48:16,810
From then on, I kept my mouth shut.

1560
01:48:17,210 --> 01:48:20,210
I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. 
It was his.

1561
01:48:21,210 --> 01:48:24,510
He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie, 
but that was it.

1562
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:29,210
It made him sick to turn the money over 
to the guys who stole it.

1563
01:48:29,245 --> 01:48:32,110
He'd rather whack them. What did I care?

1564
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:34,510
I wasn't asking for anything.

1565
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:38,210
And Jimmy was making nice money 
through my Pittsburgh connections.

1566
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:42,510
Still, months after the robbery 
they were finding bodies all over.

1567
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:08,710
When they found Carbone 
in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff...

1568
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:12,510
...it took them two days 
to thaw him out for the autopsy.

1569
01:49:17,210 --> 01:49:19,510
Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

1570
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:23,210
He was like a kid. We had money 
coming in through Pittsburgh...

1571
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:27,110
...and even after a while, 
the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

1572
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:29,410
Jimmy was so happy that morning...

1573
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:32,610
...because this was the day 
Tommy was being made.

1574
01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:36,310
Jimmy was so excited, 
you'd think he was being made.

1575
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:39,310
He must have made four calls 
to Tommy's house.

1576
01:49:39,610 --> 01:49:43,610
They had a signal set up so he'd know 
the minute the ceremony was over.

1577
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:46,410
- Ma, where are you? 
- Here I am.

1578
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:49,510
- You're home. 
- Home? I'm leaving.

1579
01:49:50,210 --> 01:49:52,310
- You look lovely. 
- I look good, huh?

1580
01:49:52,610 --> 01:49:55,910
You look wonderful. Be careful. 
Congratulations.

1581
01:49:56,810 --> 01:50:00,310
I love you. Don't paint 
any more religious pictures, please.

1582
01:50:00,345 --> 01:50:01,510
God be with you.

1583
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:04,310
We always called each other goodfellas.

1584
01:50:04,610 --> 01:50:06,310
You'd say to somebody:

1585
01:50:06,510 --> 01:50:10,710
"You'll like this guy. He's all right. 
He's a good-fella, one of us. "

1586
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:12,310
You understand?

1587
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:15,210
We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.

1588
01:50:17,910 --> 01:50:21,210
But Jimmy and I could never be made 
because we had Irish blood.

1589
01:50:21,310 --> 01:50:23,810
It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.

1590
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:27,910
To become a member of a crew 
you must be 100 percent Italian...

1591
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:31,710
...so they can trace your relatives 
back to the old country.

1592
01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:40,710
It's the highest honor they can give you.

1593
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:43,510
It means you belong to 
a family and a crew.

1594
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:46,610
It means nobody can fuck around with you.

1595
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:51,810
Also, you can fuck around with anybody, 
as long as they aren't also a member.

1596
01:50:52,110 --> 01:50:55,710
It's like a license to steal. 
A license to do anything.

1597
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:59,110
How many years since you were made?

1598
01:50:59,210 --> 01:51:01,810
I'm an old-timer. Thirty years ago.

1599
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:07,110
Brings back a lot of memories. 
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1600
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:13,410
As far as Jimmy was concerned, 
with Tommy being made...

1601
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:15,910
...it was like we were all being made.

1602
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:19,410
We would now have 
one of our own as a member.

1603
01:51:35,410 --> 01:51:37,310
- Who's this? 
- This is Vinnie.

1604
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:39,875
What happened? 
Did we get straightened out?

1605
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:43,410
We had a problem. 
We tried to do everything we could.

1606
01:51:44,310 --> 01:51:48,410
You know what I mean. He's gone, 
and we couldn't do nothing about it.

1607
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:52,210
What do you mean?

1608
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:54,110
He's gone. He's gone.

1609
01:51:55,610 --> 01:51:56,710
That's it.

1610
01:52:01,610 --> 01:52:02,810
I knew it!

1611
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:05,510
I can't fucking believe it.

1612
01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:17,510
- They fucking whacked him. 
- Fuck.

1613
01:52:34,110 --> 01:52:35,610
Are you all right?

1614
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:46,710
It was revenge for Billy Batts, 
and a lot of other things.

1615
01:52:47,610 --> 01:52:48,510
That's that.

1616
01:52:48,610 --> 01:52:51,010
There was nothing we could do about it.

1617
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:56,010
Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't. 
We had to sit still and take it.

1618
01:52:56,610 --> 01:52:59,910
It was among the Italians. 
It was real greaseball shit.

1619
01:53:12,810 --> 01:53:14,910
They even shot Tommy in the face...

1620
01:53:15,210 --> 01:53:18,810
...so his mother couldn't give him 
an open-coffin at the funeral.

1621
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:08,810
I had a busy day. 
I had to drop the guns off at Jimmy's...

1622
01:54:08,910 --> 01:54:11,010
...to match some silencers he had.

1623
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:14,210
I had to pick up my brother 
at the hospital...

1624
01:54:14,410 --> 01:54:16,810
...and pick up some stuff for Lois...

1625
01:54:16,910 --> 01:54:20,010
...to fly down to some customers I had 
near Atlanta.

1626
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:35,010
Right away I knew he didn't want them 
and I'd be stuck for the money.

1627
01:54:35,110 --> 01:54:39,210
I bought them because he wanted them 
and now he didn't want them.

1628
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:42,210
What good are these? None of them fit.

1629
01:54:42,510 --> 01:54:44,510
I'm not paying for these!

1630
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:48,510
I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was 
so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye.

1631
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:51,110
The drugs are making your mind 
into mush!

1632
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:52,810
I'll take 'em back.

1633
01:55:05,910 --> 01:55:08,075
My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.

1634
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:11,510
Since I would see them in the afternoon, 
for a delivery...

1635
01:55:11,910 --> 01:55:14,510
...I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.

1636
01:55:33,310 --> 01:55:34,510
Oh, my God.

1637
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:39,610
At the hospital, 
Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.

1638
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:42,210
What happened to you?

1639
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:45,710
I almost got into an accident 
on the way here.

1640
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:48,710
And I told him I was partying all night.

1641
01:55:49,210 --> 01:55:50,210
I'm fine.

1642
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:51,910
Get over here.

1643
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:54,010
Let me check you out.

1644
01:55:57,910 --> 01:56:00,310
He took mercy on me, gave me Valium...

1645
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:02,410
...and sent me home.

1646
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:06,610
My plan was to drop off my brother 
at the house and pick up Karen.

1647
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:11,610
There it is. 
You see that helicopter right there?

1648
01:56:12,310 --> 01:56:15,410
Right up there. 
I think it's been following me all morning.

1649
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:18,410
- Get the fuck out. Are you nuts? 
- I'm telling you.

1650
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:21,810
It's the third time I've seen it. 
At the hospital I saw it.

1651
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:25,110
I had to make some stops. 
I've seen it every time.

1652
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:28,310
I've been all over town 
and I've seen it all day.

1653
01:56:34,910 --> 01:56:36,810
I was cooking dinner that night.

1654
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:41,310
I had to start braising the beef 
and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

1655
01:56:44,010 --> 01:56:47,210
It was Michael's favorite. 
I was making ziti with gravy...

1656
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:49,210
...roasted peppers...

1657
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:53,010
...string beans with olive oil. 
I had some beautiful cutlets...

1658
01:56:53,910 --> 01:56:55,410
...that were cut just right...

1659
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:58,510
...that I was going to fry up 
as an appetizer.

1660
01:56:58,610 --> 01:57:00,710
So I was home for about an hour.

1661
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:05,210
My plan was to start dinner early so I 
could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.

1662
01:57:05,410 --> 01:57:09,610
Then get the package for Lois 
to take to Atlanta later that night.

1663
01:57:10,810 --> 01:57:14,610
I kept looking out the window 
and saw that the helicopter was gone.

1664
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:16,710
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.

1665
01:57:16,810 --> 01:57:19,310
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1666
01:57:19,510 --> 01:57:23,810
I asked my brother to watch the sauce, 
and Karen and I started out.

1667
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:27,810
Oh, God. I see it.

1668
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:30,710
- Look, it's right there. 
- Damn!

1669
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:33,510
That's it.

1670
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:35,810
We got to get to your mother's.

1671
01:57:36,110 --> 01:57:37,310
See, I told you.

1672
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:38,810
It's funny.

1673
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:42,910
- It's not the end of the world. 
- We're going to your mother's.

1674
01:58:10,910 --> 01:58:14,610
Tell your mother not to touch anything 
outside of the house. Nothing.

1675
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:17,610
Why didn't you go to your mother's house?

1676
01:58:18,710 --> 01:58:21,810
"Everything's gonna be all right 
this morning"

1677
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:24,310
Let's go shopping.

1678
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:31,110
No, I'm not nuts, 
it's been following me all fucking morning!

1679
01:58:34,510 --> 01:58:36,510
Alright. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1680
01:58:36,610 --> 01:58:40,710
I should bring him the helicopter, 
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1681
01:58:41,910 --> 01:58:43,910
Come on, let's go inside.

1682
01:58:47,910 --> 01:58:49,210
Yeah, it's gone.

1683
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:52,710
- I don't hear anything. 
- Let's go back to your mother's.

1684
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:07,810
- They all right? 
- They're great.

1685
01:59:08,010 --> 01:59:11,310
Didn't I say you were paranoid? 
Didn't I tell him?

1686
01:59:11,710 --> 01:59:13,410
Yeah. I need a hit.

1687
01:59:13,710 --> 01:59:16,910
Want to see helicopters? 
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1688
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:20,010
I've seen enough helicopters for one day, 
thank you.

1689
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:25,210
I had to get home and get the package 
ready for Lois to take on her trip.

1690
01:59:25,410 --> 01:59:29,410
Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give 
the package a whack with quinine.

1691
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:31,975
Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.

1692
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:35,710
I had the cooking to finish, 
and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.

1693
01:59:35,745 --> 01:59:39,310
- It's Sandy. What the fuck is this? 
- She's a pain in the ass.

1694
01:59:39,810 --> 01:59:41,975
- When are you coming over? 
- In an hour.

1695
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:45,310
- You staying tonight, right? 
- I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1696
01:59:45,410 --> 01:59:49,610
Come on, stop. Stop. 
We'll talk about it later, okay? Good-bye.

1697
01:59:57,110 --> 01:59:59,110
- Hello? 
- It's me. You ready?

1698
02:00:00,210 --> 02:00:02,710
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.

1699
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:06,910
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick. 
- I'm stirring it.

1700
02:00:07,110 --> 02:00:09,410
- Listen, you know what to do? 
- Yeah, yeah.

1701
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:11,910
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois! 
This is important.

1702
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:14,810
Make sure you leave the house 
when you make the call.

1703
02:00:14,910 --> 02:00:17,810
Understand me? Call from an outside line. 
I mean it!

1704
02:00:17,910 --> 02:00:21,210
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. 
I know what to do.

1705
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:24,310
You little hick, just make sure you do it!

1706
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:25,510
You're a pain.

1707
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:27,610
- Hey! Just do it! 
- Okay.

1708
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:34,610
Un-fucking-believable. All of them. 
Every fucking girl in my life.

1709
02:00:36,110 --> 02:00:38,110
- What'd he say? 
- Nothing.

1710
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:40,810
What does she do after she hangs up?

1711
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:44,710
After everything I told her? 
After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?

1712
02:00:45,010 --> 02:00:49,710
She calls from the house. If anyone 
was listening they'd know everything.

1713
02:00:50,010 --> 02:00:54,810
They'd know a package was leaving my 
house and they'd have the flight number.

1714
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:58,710
As soon as I got home, I started cooking.

1715
02:00:58,910 --> 02:01:01,210
I had a few hours until Lois' flight.

1716
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:03,710
I told my brother to watch on the stove.

1717
02:01:03,810 --> 02:01:07,810
All day long the poor guy's been 
watching helicopters and tomato sauce.

1718
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:12,810
I had to drive over to Sandy's, 
mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.

1719
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:27,210
Do you think you can come over, 
fuck me, then leave?

1720
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:32,110
- Got someplace better to go? 
- Don't talk like that. Come on.

1721
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:34,310
- You all right? 
- Yeah.

1722
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:35,810
You believe me?

1723
02:01:37,310 --> 02:01:39,010
Do you believe me?

1724
02:01:42,010 --> 02:01:43,810
- That's the last one? 
- Yeah.

1725
02:01:53,010 --> 02:01:55,310
You lying son of a bitch! I hate you!

1726
02:02:02,410 --> 02:02:05,310
Please stop feeding the dog 
from the table...

1727
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:08,510
...from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1728
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:11,310
- I have to. 
- You don't have to.

1729
02:02:16,110 --> 02:02:17,510
I got to go home.

1730
02:02:19,610 --> 02:02:21,510
What do you mean you got to go home?

1731
02:02:21,610 --> 02:02:25,310
We got to tape this stuff to your leg. 
We got to go soon.

1732
02:02:26,010 --> 02:02:28,110
I got to go home and get my hat.

1733
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:31,310
Forget your fucking hat! 
Are you kidding me?

1734
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:34,710
I need a trip to Rockaway 
because you want your hat?

1735
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:38,310
I got to have it. It's my lucky hat. 
I never fly without it.

1736
02:02:40,210 --> 02:02:42,910
Do you understand 
what we are involved in?

1737
02:02:43,110 --> 02:02:46,410
I don't care. I need my hat. 
I won't fly without it.

1738
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:55,110
What could I do if she insisted 
I drive her home for her damn hat?

1739
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:58,010
I hid the package and 
went to take her home.

1740
02:02:58,110 --> 02:02:59,110
A hat?

1741
02:03:08,110 --> 02:03:09,710
What the fuck is this?

1742
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:12,410
Police! Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!

1743
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:15,510
I'll blow your brains out! 
Shut the car off slowly!

1744
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:24,110
I thought I was dead, but when I 
heard all the noise I knew they were cops.

1745
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:26,110
Only cops talk that way.

1746
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:27,710
Don't fucking move.

1747
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:31,510
If they had been wiseguys, 
I wouldn't have heard a thing.

1748
02:03:31,910 --> 02:03:33,610
I would have been dead.

1749
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:36,510
Michael! Lock the door!

1750
02:04:00,310 --> 02:04:05,010
Talk to me. When was the last time 
you took a collar? I'm talking to you.

1751
02:04:05,310 --> 02:04:09,110
You don't want to say a fucking word, 
don't. I don't give a fuck.

1752
02:04:09,210 --> 02:04:13,210
You'll do 25 years. See how much 
of a good guy you'll be then.

1753
02:04:13,410 --> 02:04:16,410
All day I thought the guys 
in the helicopter...

1754
02:04:16,510 --> 02:04:20,410
...were local cops busting my balls over 
Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.

1755
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:21,875
Just get the lawyer.

1756
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:25,210
They'd been on me a month. 
Phone taps, surveillance, everything.

1757
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:28,110
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1758
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:31,810
You don't want to talk to me, 
you'll have a fucking problem all night.

1759
02:04:31,910 --> 02:04:35,810
Each one of these counts holds 
25-to-life in New York State.

1760
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:40,210
25 fucking years, pal. 
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1761
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:44,010
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1762
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:48,710
Are we going to make a cake? 
You going to make a fucking cake?

1763
02:04:49,010 --> 02:04:51,210
You got anything good in there?

1764
02:04:52,810 --> 02:04:54,210
Is it good?

1765
02:04:59,110 --> 02:05:00,810
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1766
02:05:03,710 --> 02:05:05,410
See you in Attica, dick.

1767
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:09,310
I spoke to Jimmy. 
He offered to give me some money.

1768
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:13,010
He wants to know what's happening. 
He just wants to talk to you.

1769
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:14,775
Fuck Jimmy and his money!

1770
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:18,410
I got to straighten out everything 
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1771
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,810
Then you're better off staying in here.

1772
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:25,810
They could whack me in here as easy as 
outside. They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1773
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:30,610
People are already walking away from me. 
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1774
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:34,910
Karen finally got her mother to put 
her house up for my bail and I was out.

1775
02:05:35,110 --> 02:05:39,410
I remember I had this feeling I would be 
killed right outside thejail.

1776
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:43,210
I knew Paulie was still pissed at me 
and he's such a hothead.

1777
02:05:43,245 --> 02:05:45,010
And I was worried about Jimmy.

1778
02:05:45,110 --> 02:05:49,610
See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out 
he was in the drug deals with me...

1779
02:05:50,010 --> 02:05:53,410
...Paulie would have Jimmy whacked 
even before me.

1780
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:56,510
This is the bad time.

1781
02:05:57,510 --> 02:06:00,110
I didn't feel safe until I got home.

1782
02:06:01,410 --> 02:06:05,310
Now my plan was to stay alive 
long enough to sell off the dope...

1783
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:10,010
...the cops never found, then disappear 
until things got straightened out.

1784
02:06:11,810 --> 02:06:14,510
Fuck! Where's the stuff I left, Karen?

1785
02:06:14,810 --> 02:06:16,710
I flushed it down the toilet.

1786
02:06:18,010 --> 02:06:18,910
What?

1787
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:22,110
What was I supposed to do?

1788
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:26,410
That was worth $60,000! 
I need that money! That's all we got!

1789
02:06:26,910 --> 02:06:29,110
They had a search warrant!

1790
02:06:29,810 --> 02:06:34,310
That's all the money we had! I was 
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1791
02:06:34,510 --> 02:06:37,210
I had to! They were going to find it!

1792
02:06:37,410 --> 02:06:41,210
- They wouldn't have found it! 
- They would have! I swear!

1793
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:44,310
They would've found it!

1794
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:47,610
Why did you do that?

1795
02:06:48,110 --> 02:06:51,310
- They would have found it. 
- Why did you do that?

1796
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:54,210
Oh, my God!

1797
02:06:54,910 --> 02:06:57,110
- I had to do it. 
- Oh, my God!

1798
02:07:33,810 --> 02:07:35,910
Paulie, I'm really sorry.

1799
02:07:38,510 --> 02:07:41,610
I don't know what else to say. 
I know I fucked up.

1800
02:07:41,910 --> 02:07:43,410
Yeah, you fucked up.

1801
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:48,810
But I'm all right now.

1802
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:54,210
I can be trusted now. I'm clean. 
On my kids, I'm clean.

1803
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:57,410
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1804
02:07:58,410 --> 02:08:02,410
You treated me like a fucking jerk. 
Like I was never nothing to you.

1805
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:05,510
After what you said, 
I couldn't come to you.

1806
02:08:06,810 --> 02:08:08,810
You know, I was ashamed.

1807
02:08:12,110 --> 02:08:13,810
I'm ashamed now.

1808
02:08:17,410 --> 02:08:19,710
But I got nowhere else to go.

1809
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:27,410
You're all I got. And I really, 
really need your help. I really do.

1810
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:34,410
Take this.

1811
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:52,010
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1812
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:03,810
Thirty-two hundred bucks.

1813
02:09:04,210 --> 02:09:07,410
That's what he gave me. 
$3,200 for a lifetime.

1814
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:11,610
It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.

1815
02:09:11,645 --> 02:09:14,175
- We got to get out. 
- I don't want to run.

1816
02:09:14,210 --> 02:09:18,010
Am I supposed to pick up 
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1817
02:09:18,610 --> 02:09:20,610
I don't want to do that.

1818
02:09:21,110 --> 02:09:25,010
If we stay around here we're dead. 
You got it? We' re dead.

1819
02:09:26,810 --> 02:09:31,510
They're right. You took too much 
of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.

1820
02:09:34,810 --> 02:09:36,410
How's he doing?

1821
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:38,310
He's okay.

1822
02:09:38,810 --> 02:09:40,510
They sobered him up.

1823
02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:42,810
Good. Glad to hear it.

1824
02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:50,310
- What kind of questions they been asking? 
- I don't know.

1825
02:09:52,010 --> 02:09:55,610
I got my mind on so many other things. 
I got no money.

1826
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:58,910
The girls are old enough 
to read the newspapers.

1827
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:01,010
Tell him he's got to call me.

1828
02:10:01,710 --> 02:10:05,510
As soon as you talk to him, 
he's got to call me. It's important.

1829
02:10:05,710 --> 02:10:09,210
He doesn't know I came here to see you. 
It's like he's crazy.

1830
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:12,510
- Take this. It's a couple thousand. 
- Thanks, Jimmy.

1831
02:10:12,710 --> 02:10:15,075
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1832
02:10:15,110 --> 02:10:18,310
I got some beautiful Dior dresses. 
You want to have them?

1833
02:10:18,410 --> 02:10:20,310
Pick out a few for yourself.

1834
02:10:21,110 --> 02:10:23,110
- For my mom. 
- Yeah, whatever.

1835
02:10:23,410 --> 02:10:25,810
Not here. In the store on the corner.

1836
02:10:26,110 --> 02:10:28,610
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1837
02:10:34,510 --> 02:10:36,410
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1838
02:10:36,510 --> 02:10:38,110
- Thanks. 
- Don't worry.

1839
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:40,710
- I'll try. 
- He's got to call me.

1840
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:44,710
Over here?

1841
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:46,310
Right down there.

1842
02:11:00,810 --> 02:11:02,910
It's over there, on the corner.

1843
02:11:03,210 --> 02:11:04,410
Right there.

1844
02:11:38,110 --> 02:11:40,610
No! Go ahead! It's right there!

1845
02:11:40,910 --> 02:11:43,110
No, Jimmy! I'm in a hurry!

1846
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:46,110
My mom's watching the kids! 
I got to get home!

1847
02:11:46,410 --> 02:11:48,110
I'll come back later!

1848
02:12:16,410 --> 02:12:17,810
What happened?

1849
02:12:18,710 --> 02:12:20,010
Nothing.

1850
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:22,910
- What happened? 
- I just got scared.

1851
02:12:25,810 --> 02:12:27,310
Got the keys?

1852
02:12:28,610 --> 02:12:29,910
What happened?

1853
02:12:30,010 --> 02:12:32,410
I just got scared. It's okay.

1854
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:34,010
Are you all right?

1855
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:45,010
Ifyou're part of a crew nobody ever 
tells you they're going to kill you.

1856
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:47,810
It doesn't happen that way.

1857
02:12:48,010 --> 02:12:51,410
There aren't any arguments 
or curses like in the movies.

1858
02:12:51,610 --> 02:12:55,510
Your murderers come with smiles. 
They come as your friends.

1859
02:12:55,910 --> 02:12:58,010
People who cared for you all your life.

1860
02:12:58,110 --> 02:13:02,810
They always seem to come when you're 
weakest and most in need of their help.

1861
02:13:03,110 --> 02:13:06,110
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place 
we both knew.

1862
02:13:06,410 --> 02:13:10,110
I got there 15 minutes early 
and Jimmy was already there.

1863
02:13:10,810 --> 02:13:15,410
He took the booth near the window 
so he could see everyone who drove up.

1864
02:13:15,710 --> 02:13:18,210
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

1865
02:13:18,410 --> 02:13:21,310
He wasjumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

1866
02:13:22,210 --> 02:13:25,310
On the surface, 
everything was supposed to be fine.

1867
02:13:25,610 --> 02:13:28,010
We were supposed to be discussing 
my case.

1868
02:13:28,110 --> 02:13:32,910
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying 
to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.

1869
02:13:34,510 --> 02:13:38,210
I been telling you your whole life, 
don't talk on the phone.

1870
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:40,010
Now you understand?

1871
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:46,410
It's going to be okay. 
You got a good chance to beat this case.

1872
02:13:49,410 --> 02:13:53,810
Well, you know that kid from the city 
we were talking about? You know?

1873
02:13:56,410 --> 02:14:01,010
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon 
as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1874
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:05,710
I know where he is. He's hiding out.

1875
02:14:06,810 --> 02:14:08,410
Know what I'm saying?

1876
02:14:13,210 --> 02:14:16,910
Would you have a problem going 
with Anthony to take care of that?

1877
02:14:19,510 --> 02:14:21,010
No, not at all.

1878
02:14:22,410 --> 02:14:24,210
That way they got nothing.

1879
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:35,910
Jimmy had never asked me 
to whack somebody before.

1880
02:14:36,110 --> 02:14:40,310
But now he's asking me to go to Florida 
and do a hit with Anthony.

1881
02:14:47,210 --> 02:14:51,310
That's when I knew I would never 
have come back from Florida alive.

1882
02:15:04,410 --> 02:15:07,910
Wherever you move me, 
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1883
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:10,410
...I don't want to go any place cold.

1884
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:13,110
You don't have a choice.

1885
02:15:13,910 --> 02:15:16,710
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1886
02:15:17,210 --> 02:15:19,710
...just no place cold. Do that for me.

1887
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:22,010
He's bronchial, that's why.

1888
02:15:22,310 --> 02:15:24,810
If he's bronchial we'll consider that.

1889
02:15:24,910 --> 02:15:26,875
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1890
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:30,410
Can I ask you some questions? 
What about my parents?

1891
02:15:31,910 --> 02:15:33,010
What about them?

1892
02:15:33,110 --> 02:15:36,510
Am I going to see them? 
Am I going to talk to them?

1893
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:39,410
Don't I have some kind of contact 
with them?

1894
02:15:39,810 --> 02:15:40,810
No.

1895
02:15:42,010 --> 02:15:45,510
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
You mean to tell me...

1896
02:15:45,710 --> 02:15:49,910
...if something happens to my parents 
and they get sick, I can't see them?

1897
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:53,010
Maybe something can be worked out 
if they're sick.

1898
02:15:53,210 --> 02:15:55,910
If there's extraordinary circumstances-

1899
02:15:56,110 --> 02:15:59,110
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

1900
02:15:59,710 --> 02:16:01,810
I can't leave my parents.

1901
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:05,210
Karen, I told you before.

1902
02:16:06,210 --> 02:16:09,710
I'm not going to do this unless 
you and the kids come with me.

1903
02:16:11,410 --> 02:16:13,510
I can't do it without you.

1904
02:16:13,710 --> 02:16:16,410
So you do whatever, but... that's it.

1905
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:21,810
- You need Henry, not me, right? 
- That's right.

1906
02:16:22,110 --> 02:16:24,310
I don't care whether you go or not.

1907
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:28,310
If it'll make him a better witness, 
I want you with him.

1908
02:16:28,510 --> 02:16:30,110
They don't want me.

1909
02:16:30,210 --> 02:16:33,810
Henry'll be in the protection program. 
They can't get to him.

1910
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:37,510
They can only get to him 
by getting to you or your kids.

1911
02:16:37,710 --> 02:16:40,410
If he goes into the program 
you're in danger.

1912
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:42,910
- I don't know anything. 
- Don't give me...

1913
02:16:42,945 --> 02:16:44,510
...the babe-in-the-woods routine.

1914
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:48,910
I've listened to those wiretaps 
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

1915
02:16:49,210 --> 02:16:53,110
Conversation after conversation 
you talked to Henry on the phone.

1916
02:16:57,710 --> 02:17:00,510
It doesn't matter. 
Whether he goes to jail...

1917
02:17:00,610 --> 02:17:03,410
...or stays on the streets, he's a dead man.

1918
02:17:04,010 --> 02:17:05,910
He knows it and you know it.

1919
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:09,610
What about the kids and school?

1920
02:17:10,110 --> 02:17:11,610
I mean, what goes on?

1921
02:17:12,410 --> 02:17:14,510
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

1922
02:17:14,610 --> 02:17:17,010
Whoever sold you those suits 
had a sense of humor.

1923
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:20,510
What it comes down to is 
we're your only salvation.

1924
02:17:20,910 --> 02:17:24,710
We'll save your life, his life, 
and we'll keep you out of jail.

1925
02:17:28,010 --> 02:17:31,110
This morning you told the jury 
about your background.

1926
02:17:31,210 --> 02:17:33,610
It was easy for us to disappear.

1927
02:17:33,810 --> 02:17:38,210
My house was in my mother-in-law's name. 
My cars were registered to my wife.

1928
02:17:38,310 --> 02:17:41,710
My Social Security cards 
and driver's licenses were phonies.

1929
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:44,310
I never voted or paid taxes.

1930
02:17:44,810 --> 02:17:49,210
My birth certificate and arrest sheet 
were all that showed I was alive.

1931
02:17:49,310 --> 02:17:52,010
- Do you see him here in this courtroom? 
- Yes.

1932
02:17:52,310 --> 02:17:55,310
Will you please point him out for the jury?

1933
02:17:57,310 --> 02:18:01,910
Let the record show that Mr. Hill 
identified the defendant, James Conway.

1934
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:06,110
Do you also know a man 
named Paul Cicero?

1935
02:18:06,410 --> 02:18:08,710
- Do you see him in the courtroom? 
- Yes.

1936
02:18:08,910 --> 02:18:11,410
Can you point him out for the jury?

1937
02:18:12,310 --> 02:18:16,510
Let the record show Mr. Hill 
identified the defendant Paul Cicero.

1938
02:18:18,410 --> 02:18:20,010
I have a document...

1939
02:18:20,310 --> 02:18:23,110
The hardest thing was leaving the life.

1940
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:25,310
I still loved the life.

1941
02:18:25,510 --> 02:18:29,410
We were treated like movie stars 
with muscle. We had it all.

1942
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:33,110
Our wives, mothers, kids, 
everybody rode along.

1943
02:18:33,610 --> 02:18:37,010
I had paper bags filled withjewelry 
stashed in the kitchen.

1944
02:18:37,110 --> 02:18:39,210
I had a bowl of coke next to my bed.

1945
02:18:39,310 --> 02:18:43,110
People call them rats because 
they will do anything to survive.

1946
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:45,210
- Objection! 
- Objection sustained.

1947
02:18:45,310 --> 02:18:49,210
- I know nothing about being a rat. 
- You know everything about it!

1948
02:18:51,010 --> 02:18:53,410
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.

1949
02:18:53,510 --> 02:18:56,910
Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideouts 
all over the city.

1950
02:18:57,210 --> 02:18:59,710
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend...

1951
02:18:59,910 --> 02:19:04,010
...then blow the winnings in a week 
or go to sharks to pay the bookies.

1952
02:19:04,210 --> 02:19:05,710
Didn't matter.

1953
02:19:06,010 --> 02:19:10,310
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke 
I would go rob some more.

1954
02:19:11,210 --> 02:19:12,910
We ran everything.

1955
02:19:13,310 --> 02:19:17,110
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers. 
We paid off judges.

1956
02:19:17,710 --> 02:19:21,610
Everybody had their hands out. 
Everything was for the taking.

1957
02:19:23,210 --> 02:19:24,910
And now it's all over.

1958
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:27,610
That's the hardest part.

1959
02:19:28,410 --> 02:19:30,210
Today everything is different.

1960
02:19:30,310 --> 02:19:34,210
There's no action. I have to wait around 
like everyone else.

1961
02:19:34,710 --> 02:19:36,810
Can't even get decent food.

1962
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:40,410
After I got here I ordered spaghetti 
with marinara sauce...

1963
02:19:40,510 --> 02:19:42,910
...and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

1964
02:19:43,010 --> 02:19:44,910
I'm an average nobody.

1965
02:19:45,810 --> 02:19:48,810
I get to live the rest of my life 
like a schnook.
