1
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,639
Dad.

2
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:35,583
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

3
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:40,921
Port side stick, starboard side stick,
move fast and clear those murder holes.

4
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,340
I want to see plenty of beach
between men.

5
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:47,344
Five men is a juicy opportunity.
One man is a waste of ammo.

6
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:49,513
Keep the sand out of your weapons.

7
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,018
Keep those actions clear.
And I'll see you on the beach.

8
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:28,385
Clear the murder holes!

9
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:46,278
Over the side!

10
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:55,204
Port and starboard, over...

11
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,649
Jesus.

12
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:07,860
Thank you...

13
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,793
I said, what the hell do we do now, sir?

14
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:34,465
Captain Miller! Captain Miller!

15
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:39,303
-Captain Miller!
-Sergeant Horvath!

16
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:44,516
Move your men off the beach! Go!

17
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:45,934
Okay, you guys!

18
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,104
-Get on my ass! Follow me!
-Sir!

19
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,482
What's the rallying point?

20
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,400
Anywhere but here!

21
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:08,957
The seawall! Move up to the seawall!

22
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,335
Sir, I'm staying!

23
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,712
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

24
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:16,381
This is all we got
between us and the Almighty.

25
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:20,511
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

26
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,681
You stay here, you're dead men!

27
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:41,448
Mama! Mama!

28
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,580
Stay down! Stay down!

29
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:54,586
What are you guys?

30
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:57,381
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

31
00:11:57,465 --> 00:12:00,133
Here to set up field operations!

32
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:01,760
Get rid of that crap!

33
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:04,930
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

34
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:15,440
-I'm hit! I'm hit!
-Briggs!

35
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:23,991
Get me out of here. I'm hit low. God!

36
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:27,160
-Medic!
-Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

37
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:30,956
I gotta clear these obstacles,
make holes for the tanks.

38
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,375
All the armour is foundering
in the Channel.

39
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:36,712
Orders, sir. You go somewhere else.
I'm clearing this one!

40
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:38,589
Come on, Briggs!

41
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:44,553
Medic!

42
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,258
Move! Move!

43
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:34,061
Move! Come on! Move!

44
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:59,169
Shore party.
No armour has made it ashore.

45
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:03,966
We got no DD tanks on the beach.
Dog One is not open.

46
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:08,553
-Who's in command here?
-You are, sir!

47
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,641
-Sergeant Horvath!
-Sir!

48
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,768
You recognise where we are?

49
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:17,270
Right where we're supposed to be,
but no one else is!

50
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:20,816
Nobody's where they're supposed to be.

51
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,484
Shore party.

52
00:14:23,277 --> 00:14:25,529
First wave, ineffective.

53
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:29,658
We do not hold the beach.
Say again, we do not hold the beach.

54
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:31,410
We're all mixed up, sir.

55
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:33,286
We got the leftovers from Fox Company,

56
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,330
Able Company and George Company!

57
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:39,042
Plus we got some Navy demo guys
and a beachmaster!

58
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:43,588
Shore party. Shore party.

59
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,014
CATF , CATF ...

60
00:14:55,518 --> 00:14:57,811
-Reiben here, sir!
-Did you see anybody else?

61
00:14:57,895 --> 00:15:00,689
-Jackson, but that's about it.
-Mellish here.

62
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:04,026
Caparzo! We got DeForest
back there with Wade.

63
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,863
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 100 leaks.

64
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,614
Wade says he's all used up.

65
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:11,950
-Move on to somebody you can help.
-Let's go!

66
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:14,494
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

67
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,500
-Get his attention.
-Wade!

68
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,085
-Yo, Doc!
-Wade!

69
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,338
-Wade! Wade! Wade!
-Wade!

70
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:29,676
-Wade! Wade! Wade!
-Too risky, Doc. Too risky.

71
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:33,221
-Wade!
-All right. Get him off the beach.

72
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:37,059
I got it! We stopped the bleeding!
We stopped the bleeding!

73
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,228
Fuck!

74
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:43,607
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

75
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,109
-Son of a fucking cocksucker!
-Wade! Come on. Come on.

76
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:49,404
Wade! It's Mellish! Wade!

77
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:51,615
-Mellish!
-Let's go!

78
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:52,866
We found Miller!

79
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,535
-Fuck it!
-Let's move! Let's move!

80
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:05,712
This is all? This is all that's made it?

81
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:09,299
We got scattered pretty bad, sir.
There's bound to be more.

82
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,636
-Not enough. It's not enough.
-Dog One exit...

83
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,096
It's gotta be that cut on the right.

84
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,681
-Or is that one on the left? Shit!
-No. No, no, no.

85
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,476
Vierville is to the west of us.
This is Dog One.

86
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,811
They're killing us!

87
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:25,023
And we don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

88
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:29,402
Gather weapons and ammo!

89
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:32,572
Come on, let's drag them in
off the sand!

90
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:44,584
Reiben. Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,
where's your BAR?

91
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,462
Bottom of the channel, sir.
The bitch tried to drown me.

92
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:49,422
Find a replacement.

93
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:54,427
Bangalores! Bring up some bangalores!

94
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:59,391
Grenades, grenades! Get me
some grenades. Get them over here!

95
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:06,064
Bangalores up the line!
Bangalores up the line!

96
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:08,441
Heads up! Bangers coming your way!

97
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,944
Come on, come on, come on!

98
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:13,864
-Jackson here, sir!
-Reiben back, sir!

99
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:17,284
Oh, my God!

100
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,747
One more. Give me one more.

101
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,797
Oh, my God, it hurts! I'm gonna die!

102
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:34,843
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God!

103
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,389
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
Almost got it.

104
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:42,517
-Jesus! Lucky bastard.
-Come on.

105
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:45,687
-Move it!
-Keep it moving. You got it?

106
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:48,815
God! God, help me!

107
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:51,359
You're not gonna die.
You're not gonna die.

108
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:54,613
You're fine. Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

109
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:58,450
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

110
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:01,203
-Fire in the hole!
-Fire in the hole!

111
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:06,750
Fire in the hole!

112
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:20,055
We're in business! Defilade!
Other side of the hole!

113
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,445
That's it! Let's go!

114
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:41,034
Inspected. Morphine.

115
00:18:43,913 --> 00:18:45,288
Routine.

116
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,754
Priority.

117
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,968
He's gone.

118
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:12,148
Son of a...

119
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,568
-Get in there.
-Fuck. I can't move.

120
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:16,903
-Mellish.
-Yes, sir.

121
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:18,822
Give me your bayonet.

122
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,762
Two MG42s and two mortars.
Add 20, left 30.

123
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,601
There's a little defilade over there,
but it's the perfect fire position

124
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:50,437
if we get some goddamn armour
on the beach.

125
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:53,606
We gotta open up this draw!
We gotta get this draw open.

126
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:55,608
Reiben, Mellish, let's get into the war!

127
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:58,695
Grab some cover
and put some fire on that crew.

128
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:02,490
Davis, Debernardo,
Young, Valk, get ready.

129
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:06,536
Covering fire!

130
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,583
Go, go, go!

131
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:27,557
Goddamn firing squad.

132
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:30,852
It's the only way we can get
everybody the hell out of here.

133
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:35,148
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!
You're next!

134
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:37,859
Why don't we just hand out
blindfolds, Cap?

135
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:39,527
All we can do here is die.

136
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:41,196
Covering fire!

137
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:45,450
Go, go, go!

138
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,411
Come on! Come on! Come on!

139
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:50,413
Go, God damn it!

140
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,428
-Jackson.
-Sir.

141
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:08,223
-Do you see that impact crater?
-Yes, sir.

142
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,683
That should give you complete defilade
from that machine-gun position.

143
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:12,644
Get in there and give me
some fire discipline.

144
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,646
Wait for my command.

145
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:21,778
Go!

146
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:36,126
Captain, if your mother saw you do that,
she'd be very upset.

147
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:38,503
I thought you were my mother.

148
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:42,090
Be not thou far from me, O Lord.

149
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:50,640
O my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

150
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:54,102
I detest my sins
for having offended thee, O Lord.

151
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:55,728
I detest my sins for having
offended thee, O Lord.

152
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,856
Listen to me, Lord.

153
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:06,698
All my strength, haste thee to help me.

154
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:27,510
-Dog One exit! Right here!
-We're in business!

155
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:30,889
Move! Move!

156
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:13,848
-Reiben.
-Let's go, Sarge. Go!

157
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:15,225
Reiben.

158
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:42,544
The place is full of 'em!

159
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:45,755
Come on, Doyle!

160
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:48,675
Sarge?

161
00:23:54,014 --> 00:23:57,100
-Flame!
-Doyle, do it!

162
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:04,274
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

163
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:29,549
I'll give you "comrade,"
you son of a bitch!

164
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,301
Lie down!

165
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,998
Cease fire! Cease fire!

166
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:05,251
Cut it out! Cut it out! Cease fire!

167
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:08,004
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie 3.

168
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,341
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

169
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:14,510
I'm waiting for you
to tie in my flanks. Over.

170
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:17,013
What?

171
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,935
What? I'm sorry, I can't understand
what you're saying.

172
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:33,446
What did he say? What did he say?

173
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,699
"Look, I washed for supper."

174
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,830
God damn it!

175
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:50,797
-Hey, Fish.
-Yeah?

176
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:53,549
Look at this. A Hitler Youth knife.

177
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:58,221
And now
it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

178
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:09,816
Keep it moving!

179
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,878
That's quite a view.

180
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:14,380
Yes, it is.

181
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:17,633
Quite a view.

182
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:54,605
"Dear Mr Brian Boyd,

183
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,858
"no doubt by now you have
received full information..."

184
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:59,151
-"Dear Mrs Jensen..."
-"...untimely death of your son."

185
00:28:59,236 --> 00:29:01,153
"...no words of mine
can ever relieve the grief..."

186
00:29:01,238 --> 00:29:03,531
"Our outfit has felt his loss
tremendously."

187
00:29:03,615 --> 00:29:06,367
"He was a fine soldier
and he believed very strongly in..."

188
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:09,161
"It's no secret any more
that we were involved

189
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:11,330
"in one of the most important
operations of this war."

190
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:13,958
"Al was the one
who held us all together.

191
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:15,293
"He was always the first to volunteer..."

192
00:29:15,377 --> 00:29:19,005
"...came to a clearing near a road
where over 4,000 troops had passed..."

193
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:21,299
"Your husband served in a combat unit

194
00:29:21,383 --> 00:29:23,926
"whose dangerous duty
is to place itself..."

195
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:27,138
"...which we all cherish
and hold so dear.

196
00:29:27,222 --> 00:29:30,933
"The loss of Lee and others like him
is a distinct blow to the regiment."

197
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:32,310
"I fully understand your desire

198
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:35,062
"to learn as much as possible
regarding the circumstances

199
00:29:35,147 --> 00:29:37,273
"leding to his death."

200
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:31,202
Colonel, I've got something
you should know about.

201
00:30:31,286 --> 00:30:32,578
Yes.

202
00:30:34,581 --> 00:30:37,124
These two men died in Normandy.

203
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:40,586
This one at Omaha Beach.

204
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:44,131
-Sean Ryan.
-This man at Utah.

205
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:47,510
Peter Ryan.

206
00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:54,350
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

207
00:30:57,104 --> 00:30:59,522
Daniel Ryan.

208
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:02,149
The three men are brothers, sir.

209
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:03,693
I've just learned that, this afternoon,

210
00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:07,571
their mother is going
to be getting all three telegrams.

211
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,785
That's not all. There's a fourth brother.
The youngest.

212
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:14,870
He parachuted in
with the 101 st Airborne,

213
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:16,414
night before the invasion.

214
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:18,332
He's somewhere in Normandy.
We don't know where.

215
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,835
-Is he alive?
-We don't know.

216
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:26,632
Come with me.

217
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:12,822
God damn it.

218
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:15,491
All four of them
were in the same company

219
00:33:15,575 --> 00:33:17,576
in the 29th Division,
but we split them up

220
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:19,453
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

221
00:33:21,456 --> 00:33:23,290
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

222
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:27,336
No, sir. He was dropped about
1 5 miles inland near Neuville.

223
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,712
But that's still deep
behind German lines.

224
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:31,006
Now, Mac,
there is no way you can know

225
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:34,009
where in the hell he was dropped.

226
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:36,053
General, first reports out of
Ike's people at SHAEF

227
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:38,013
said the 101 st is scattered
all to hell and gone.

228
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:40,474
There's misdrops all over Normandy.

229
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,477
Now, assuming Private Ryan
even survived the jump,

230
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:45,020
he could be anywhere.

231
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:47,148
In fact, he's probably KIA.

232
00:33:47,232 --> 00:33:50,901
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

233
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:53,571
flathatting throughout swarms
of German reinforcements

234
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:57,491
all along our axis of advance,
they're gonna be KIA, too.

235
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:22,057
I have a letter here,

236
00:34:23,435 --> 00:34:27,521
written a long time ago
to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

237
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:29,523
So bear with me.

238
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,903
"Dear Madam,

239
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,864
"I have been shown in the files
of the War Department

240
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:40,701
"a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts

241
00:34:40,785 --> 00:34:44,121
"that you are the mother of five

242
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:50,836
"sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle.

243
00:34:53,506 --> 00:34:57,259
"I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine

244
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:01,430
"that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief

245
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:04,266
"of a loss so overwhelming.

246
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:08,103
"But I cannot refrain
from tendering to you

247
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:11,357
"the consolation that may be found

248
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:15,694
"in the thanks of the republic
they died to save.

249
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:21,158
"I pray that Our Heavenly Father

250
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:24,328
"may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

251
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:28,791
"and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved lost,

252
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:31,543
"and the solemn pride
that must be yours

253
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:35,923
"to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom.

254
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:39,677
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,

255
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:41,595
"Abraham Lincoln."

256
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:02,283
That boy is alive.

257
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:05,911
We are gonna send somebody
to find him,

258
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:10,207
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

259
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:12,918
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

260
00:36:25,598 --> 00:36:28,058
We expected 32 tanks to float to
the beach. Twenty-seven didn't make it.

261
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:30,185
-Miller, Charlie Company.
-Go on in, Captain.

262
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,395
I understand your situation.

263
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:34,565
But if we don't offload
those duel-drive Shermans by 0600,

264
00:36:34,649 --> 00:36:35,858
we're gonna have an entire division

265
00:36:35,942 --> 00:36:39,653
stuck at Carentan
with its pants around its ankles.

266
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:42,156
Well, you let me know then.

267
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,117
Have Charlie Company hold at Vierville
until we can get some armour up there.

268
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:47,036
Yes, sir. Runner!

269
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:56,253
Airborne was supposed to win
an open door for the rest of us.

270
00:36:56,338 --> 00:36:58,922
Instead they misdropped,
scattered all their sticks into the wind.

271
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:03,177
-What's your situation?
-Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

272
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:04,803
We...

273
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:10,476
We took out towed 88s
here, here and here.

274
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,227
They'd already gotten four
of our Shermans

275
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:13,604
and a number
of our deuce and a halves.

276
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:16,648
These two minefields
are actually one big one.

277
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,400
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

278
00:37:18,485 --> 00:37:20,861
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field,

279
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:22,071
little bit of everything.

280
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:25,991
Spreng Mine 44s. Schuh Mine 42s,
pot mines. A-200s,

281
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:29,578
the little wooden bastards
that the mine detectors don't pick up.

282
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:34,124
This road here, they placed
big mushrooms, Teller Mine 43s,

283
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:35,376
I guess for our tanks,

284
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,962
from here right up
to the edge of the village. Right here.

285
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:41,006
So we marked them,
called the engineers.

286
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:42,383
Resistance?

287
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:44,676
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

288
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:47,054
There was an under-strength
company without artillery.

289
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:50,391
Wehrmacht 346 Infantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

290
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:52,518
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

291
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:55,771
We turned them over
to MPs from the 29th.

292
00:37:58,525 --> 00:38:00,818
What about our casualties?

293
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,570
Well, the figures

294
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:08,450
were 35 dead, times two wounded.

295
00:38:08,535 --> 00:38:11,787
They just didn't wanna
give up those 88s.

296
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:16,458
It was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

297
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:18,043
Yes, sir.

298
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:20,796
John...

299
00:38:23,758 --> 00:38:25,676
I've got another one for you.

300
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,720
-Yes, sir.
-This one's straight from the top.

301
00:38:35,311 --> 00:38:37,479
You and I are taking a squad
over to Neuville

302
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:39,481
on a public-relations mission.

303
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:41,400
You leading a squad?

304
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:44,611
Some private in the 101 st
lost three brothers,

305
00:38:44,696 --> 00:38:46,363
and he's got a ticket home.

306
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:47,573
How come Neuville?

307
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:51,577
They think he's up there somewhere,
part of all those airborne misdrops.

308
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:54,371
It's not gonna be easy
finding one particular soldier

309
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:55,622
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

310
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:58,167
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

311
00:38:58,251 --> 00:38:59,835
But what about the company?

312
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:03,213
We take the pick of the litter
and the rest get folded into Baker.

313
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:05,007
Jesus Christ.

314
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:07,134
They took away your company?

315
00:39:07,218 --> 00:39:11,722
It wasn't my company. It was
the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

316
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:15,767
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

317
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:17,269
Beasley's dead.

318
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:20,147
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

319
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:24,067
-Not that I know of.
-What about Talbot?

320
00:39:24,194 --> 00:39:27,196
-This morning.
-Oh. All right.

321
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:29,698
I'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

322
00:39:29,782 --> 00:39:31,533
Assemble at battalion motor pool
on the beach.

323
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:32,701
Yes, sir.

324
00:39:32,785 --> 00:39:34,161
-Sarge, what we gonna do?
-Okay, listen up...

325
00:39:34,245 --> 00:39:35,621
-What?
-What are we gonna do?

326
00:39:35,705 --> 00:39:37,414
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

327
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,541
with a hunk of cheese
in your ass, Caparzo, you smart ass.

328
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:41,376
-Now, listen up.
-I thought you liked it in the ass.

329
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:42,794
-What?
-I thought you liked it in the ass.

330
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:45,589
Attention!

331
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:46,924
As you were.

332
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,092
I'm looking
for Corporal Upham, Timothy E.

333
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:50,511
Yes, sir. I'm Upham, sir.

334
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:52,221
I understand you speak
French and German.

335
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:54,097
-Yes, sir.
-How's your accent?

336
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:55,849
Just a slight one in French,
but my German's clean.

337
00:39:55,934 --> 00:39:57,601
-Has a touch of Bavarian, sir.
-Very good.

338
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:59,269
You've been reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

339
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:01,730
-We're going to a place called Neuville.
-Yes, sir.

340
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:03,982
-When was this updated?
-Updated as of 0830 hour this morning.

341
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,318
-Sir...
-This is the 1 2th SS Panzer.

342
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:08,237
These are the two axes
that advance south.

343
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:10,781
-Sir, there are Germans in Neuville.
-There are artillery up here, sir.

344
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:13,575
-That's what I understand. Corporal.
-Yes, sir.

345
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,827
Sir, there are a lot
of Germans in Neuville.

346
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:16,995
You have a problem with that, Corporal?

347
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,540
No, sir. Just if you consider
I've never been in combat, sir.

348
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:21,250
I make maps and I translate.
And that's...

349
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:24,253
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

350
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:26,088
-Yes, sir.
-My two guys were killed.

351
00:40:26,172 --> 00:40:28,840
Yes, sir. It's just that I haven't
held a weapon since basic training, sir.

352
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:31,552
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

353
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:32,844
Yes, sir.

354
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:35,681
-Well, then, get your gear.
-Yes, sir.

355
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:39,101
Sir, may I bring...

356
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:45,357
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

357
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:51,780
Yes, sir.

358
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:56,827
Thank you very much, sir.

359
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:59,288
-That a souvenir?
-No, sir.

360
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:01,540
Take your time, Corporal.

361
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:08,422
You should look
on the bright side of things, Corporal.

362
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:09,631
Yes, sir.

363
00:41:09,716 --> 00:41:12,759
For one thing,
you don't need to carry those.

364
00:41:12,844 --> 00:41:15,804
-You'll need that.
-I'll need that, sir. Yes, sir.

365
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:15,781
Hey.

366
00:42:15,865 --> 00:42:18,033
You want your head blown off,
you fancy little fuck?

367
00:42:18,117 --> 00:42:20,410
Don't you ever fucking touch me
with those little rat claws again.

368
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:23,038
Get the fuck back in formation.

369
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:27,918
I was just wondering
where you're from, that's...

370
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:35,384
-Caparzo, is it?
-Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

371
00:42:35,468 --> 00:42:36,593
Got you.

372
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,887
And another thing.
Every time you salute the captain,

373
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:41,181
you make him a target for the Germans.

374
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:43,058
So do us a favour. Don't do it.

375
00:42:43,142 --> 00:42:46,103
Especially when I'm standing
next to him, capisci?

376
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:49,231
Corporal, what's your book about?

377
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:51,024
-Hey. Watch your rifle.
-Sorry.

378
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:52,359
Actually, it's about the...

379
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:53,902
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

380
00:42:53,986 --> 00:42:55,904
that develop between
soldiers during war.

381
00:42:55,988 --> 00:42:58,073
Brotherhood?

382
00:42:58,157 --> 00:42:59,741
What do you know about brotherhood?

383
00:42:59,826 --> 00:43:01,952
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

384
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:05,038
Why don't you ask
the captain where he's from?

385
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:09,501
Yeah, ask the captain. He'll tell you
everything you wanna know about him.

386
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:11,753
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

387
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:14,131
I mean, where's the sense
of risking the lives of the eight of us

388
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:15,799
to save one guy.

389
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:19,052
Twenty degrees.
Anybody wanna answer that?

390
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:22,681
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

391
00:43:22,765 --> 00:43:24,558
Hey, doc. I got a mother, all right?

392
00:43:24,642 --> 00:43:27,185
I mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

393
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,939
I mean, shit, I bet even
the captain's got a mother.

394
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:33,859
Well, maybe not the captain,
but the rest of us got mothers.

395
00:43:33,943 --> 00:43:37,612
"Theirs not to reason why
Theirs but to do and die"

396
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,782
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, Corporal, huh?

397
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:42,534
We're all supposed to die. Is that it?

398
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:45,370
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

399
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:47,956
-Yes, sir.
-We all have orders we have to follow.

400
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,751
And that supersedes everything,
including your mothers.

401
00:43:50,835 --> 00:43:52,419
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

402
00:43:52,503 --> 00:43:54,921
Even if you think
the mission's FUBAR, sir?

403
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:58,008
Especially if you think
the mission's FUBAR.

404
00:43:58,134 --> 00:44:01,803
-What's FUBAR?
-Oh, it's German. Yeah.

405
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:04,473
Never heard of that.

406
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:07,851
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

407
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:11,563
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

408
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,857
Well, from my way of thinking, sir,

409
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:16,318
this entire mission
is a serious misallocation

410
00:44:16,402 --> 00:44:18,820
of valuable military resources.

411
00:44:18,905 --> 00:44:20,822
Yeah. Go on.

412
00:44:20,907 --> 00:44:23,366
Well, it seems to me, sir,
that God gave me a special gift,

413
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:26,745
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

414
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:29,539
Reiben, pay attention.
Now, this is the way to gripe!

415
00:44:29,665 --> 00:44:30,916
Continue, Jackson.

416
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,876
Well, what I mean by that, sir,

417
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:35,670
is if you was to put me
and this here sniper rifle anywhere,

418
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:38,507
up to and including one mile
ofAdolf Hitler

419
00:44:38,591 --> 00:44:40,300
with a clear line of sight, sir...

420
00:44:40,384 --> 00:44:43,261
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

421
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:45,639
Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin.

422
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:48,767
So, Captain, what about you?
I mean, you don't gripe at all?

423
00:44:48,851 --> 00:44:51,269
I don't gripe to you, Reiben.
I'm a captain.

424
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:54,272
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down. Always up.

425
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,649
You gripe to me,

426
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:59,277
I gripe to my superior officers,
so on, so on and so on.

427
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,154
I don't gripe to you.
I don't gripe in front of you.

428
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:03,240
You should know that as a Ranger.

429
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:05,200
I'm sorry, sir, but...

430
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:08,119
Let's say you weren't a captain,
or maybe I was a major.

431
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:09,996
What would you say then?

432
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:11,873
Well, in that case,

433
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:14,042
I'd say this is an excellent mission, sir,

434
00:45:14,126 --> 00:45:17,254
with an extremely
valuable objective, sir,

435
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,797
worthy of my best efforts, sir.

436
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:24,386
Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
for the mother of Private James Ryan,

437
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:28,014
and am willing to lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

438
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:31,560
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

439
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:35,063
-He's good.
-I love him.

440
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:47,117
Right.

441
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:32,203
-Thunder!
-Flash!

442
00:46:32,288 --> 00:46:35,540
Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go.

443
00:46:45,009 --> 00:46:47,052
Go, go, go, go, go!

444
00:46:52,391 --> 00:46:55,352
-You guys are a sight for sore eyes.
-Sergeant Hill, our relief showed up.

445
00:46:55,436 --> 00:46:57,228
How many are you?

446
00:46:57,313 --> 00:46:59,940
Just eight of us.
We're not your relief. Sorry.

447
00:47:00,024 --> 00:47:01,566
You're not the relief,
what do you mean, sir?

448
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:03,234
We're here for a Private Ryan.

449
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:05,862
Who? Ryan? What for?

450
00:47:05,947 --> 00:47:07,072
-Is he here?
-Well, I don't know.

451
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:09,449
Maybe with a mixed unit
on the other side of town.

452
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:11,618
It's hard to get to. The Germans
punched a hole in our centre

453
00:47:11,702 --> 00:47:13,578
a few hours ago,
they cut us right in two.

454
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:17,165
-What's his name again?
-Ryan. James Ryan.

455
00:47:17,249 --> 00:47:18,625
He dropped in with 101st.

456
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:21,670
-Goldman, get me a runner up here.
-Runner!

457
00:47:21,754 --> 00:47:23,421
Come on.

458
00:47:27,385 --> 00:47:29,970
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

459
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:34,641
We got stopped by some intense
rifle action from the eastward.

460
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:38,436
The Germans have been
reinforcing two regiments all day.

461
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:40,730
The streets have been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

462
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:43,316
Most of the German fire now
is concentrated to the westward.

463
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:44,609
Who's that on the loudspeaker?

464
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:46,695
That? That's Dagwood Dusseldorf,

465
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:48,613
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.

466
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:51,700
The Statue of Liberty is kaput.

467
00:47:51,784 --> 00:47:55,161
-"The Statue of Liberty is kaput."
-...kaput.

468
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:57,038
That's disconcerting.

469
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:01,668
Take the second left...

470
00:48:01,752 --> 00:48:05,046
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

471
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:08,216
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with the 101 .

472
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,301
-Got that?
-Cover!

473
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:19,352
Go!

474
00:48:43,335 --> 00:48:45,545
-You sadistic fucking animals!
-Get down.

475
00:48:45,629 --> 00:48:48,715
They know we're not in direct contact.
They're gonna single out the runners.

476
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:50,508
Yeah. Why do they
keep shooting him up like that?

477
00:48:50,593 --> 00:48:53,219
Long as his lungs have breath in them,
he still carries the message.

478
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:55,013
-We'd do the same thing.
-No, we wouldn't!

479
00:48:55,097 --> 00:48:58,058
-Wade! Get them ready to travel.
-Yes, sir.

480
00:48:58,142 --> 00:49:00,018
-Boyd!
-Come on!

481
00:49:00,102 --> 00:49:02,854
Try again. See if you can let
Captain Hamill know we're coming.

482
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:05,523
What's the rest of Neuville look like?

483
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:07,984
Next block's got two-storey buildings,
both sides of the street.

484
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:09,444
-There's a lot of windows.
-...copy? Over.

485
00:49:09,528 --> 00:49:11,905
And then there's a wide open square
with pretty good cover on the left.

486
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:14,240
-Show me.
-Sarge, hold right here.

487
00:49:14,325 --> 00:49:15,742
Yes, sir!

488
00:49:20,164 --> 00:49:22,791
All right. Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

489
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:24,000
Try a left hook.

490
00:49:24,085 --> 00:49:25,835
Shoot and scoot,
two of yours, two of mine.

491
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,379
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

492
00:49:29,548 --> 00:49:32,342
-Reiben, Caparzo. Fundamentals.
-They're still jamming us.

493
00:49:32,426 --> 00:49:35,053
Short runs. High and low at the corners.

494
00:49:35,137 --> 00:49:37,597
It's gonna be tight.
Be prepared for close contact.

495
00:49:37,681 --> 00:49:39,516
-Go. Upham.
-Yes, sir.

496
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,726
-You stay with Sergeant Horvath.
-Stay right here.

497
00:49:41,811 --> 00:49:45,438
I'll wear him like underwear, Captain!
Stay with me.

498
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:55,031
All right, past the end
of the block to the left.

499
00:49:55,116 --> 00:49:56,241
Those are the gates to the square.

500
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:57,617
Good.

501
00:50:05,626 --> 00:50:07,418
Reiben, where's the captain from?

502
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:09,671
You figure that one out,
you got yourself a nice prize.

503
00:50:09,755 --> 00:50:11,381
300 bucks, last I heard.

504
00:50:11,465 --> 00:50:14,717
Company's got a pool.
5 bucks gets you in.

505
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,473
Easy.

506
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:25,937
It's around this corner.
Defilade right up to those gates.

507
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:29,524
Somebody must know where he's from,
what he did for a living.

508
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:31,442
I've been with him
since Kasserine Pass,

509
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:32,694
but I don't have a clue.

510
00:50:32,778 --> 00:50:34,571
My ankles are killing me.

511
00:50:34,655 --> 00:50:37,615
I'll need a wheelchair
before this war is over.

512
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,160
Oh, that's it. Oh, my God.

513
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:43,496
Got ankles like an old woman.
Like an old...

514
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,290
Oh, God.

515
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:50,211
Reiben, so, you don't even know
where he went to school?

516
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:51,504
Captain didn't go to school.

517
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:54,757
They assembled him at OCS
out of spare body parts of dead Gls.

518
00:50:54,842 --> 00:50:56,217
You gotta pay attention to detail.

519
00:50:56,302 --> 00:50:58,219
I know exactly where he's from
and exactly what he did

520
00:50:58,304 --> 00:51:00,555
'cause I pay attention to detail.

521
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,100
Hey, Upham,
careful you don't step in the bullshit.

522
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,816
-Do it.
-Thunder!

523
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:15,028
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

524
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:27,832
Upham, tell them to show themselves.

525
00:51:39,136 --> 00:51:42,180
Ask them if they know
where the Germans are.

526
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,187
-What's he saying?
-Something about the children.

527
00:51:50,231 --> 00:51:52,732
-They want us to take the children.
-No, no, no. We can't take the kids.

528
00:51:52,816 --> 00:51:54,484
We can't take the kids. We can't!

529
00:51:54,568 --> 00:51:57,820
We can't take the kids! No!

530
00:52:00,699 --> 00:52:01,866
They think they'll be safe with us.

531
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:04,118
It's not gonna be
safe when they're with us!

532
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:08,248
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!

533
00:52:08,332 --> 00:52:12,126
-Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!
-They think they'll be safe with us, sir.

534
00:52:12,419 --> 00:52:15,713
Caparzo! Put that kid back!

535
00:52:16,173 --> 00:52:17,465
It's okay.

536
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:20,802
-Caparzo! Put that little girl back!
-It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

537
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:23,930
Caparzo, give that kid back now!

538
00:52:24,014 --> 00:52:28,059
Upham, how do you say, "It's okay"?
I can't. She reminds me of my niece, sir.

539
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:30,103
Caparzo, get the kid back up there!

540
00:52:30,187 --> 00:52:31,521
Captain, the decent thing to do

541
00:52:31,605 --> 00:52:33,815
is to at least take her down
the road to the next town.

542
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:37,151
We're not here to do the decent thing!
We're here to follow fucking orders!

543
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:39,612
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

544
00:52:40,364 --> 00:52:42,532
Cover! Cover!

545
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:54,752
God damn it! Where'd that come from?

546
00:52:56,547 --> 00:53:00,008
He was on the ground
before we heard the shot.

547
00:53:04,763 --> 00:53:06,681
That's where I'd be.

548
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,767
I didn't see it.

549
00:53:09,852 --> 00:53:12,687
Four hundred fifty yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

550
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:17,025
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas!
This sniper's got talent!

551
00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:24,949
Please don't cry. I'm gonna take you
back to your mama and papa.

552
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:27,243
Please don't cry. Come on.

553
00:53:30,497 --> 00:53:31,914
Carpy.

554
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,345
-Captain.
-Hold on, Caparzo.

555
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:48,931
Help me up. I can walk. I can walk.

556
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:51,184
Caparzo, stay still!

557
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:04,906
Two clicks, left wind.

558
00:54:08,577 --> 00:54:09,911
Fish!

559
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,713
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

560
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:22,757
Wade, you stay put.

561
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:25,051
Where's he shot, Captain?

562
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:29,430
-Captain, can you see him from there?
-You stay there!

563
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:33,184
Damn it, stay down!
What's the matter with you?

564
00:54:33,268 --> 00:54:37,021
Am I gonna take care of you
if you get hit? Huh?

565
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:40,358
-Fish, come over here.
-Carpy, put your head down.

566
00:54:40,442 --> 00:54:43,611
Why can't you put your head down?

567
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:54,122
O my God, I trust in thee.

568
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:56,249
Let me not be ashamed.

569
00:54:57,126 --> 00:54:59,961
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

570
00:55:09,763 --> 00:55:11,431
Copy it.

571
00:55:11,515 --> 00:55:13,850
Copy it and send it for me.

572
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:16,394
Carpy, you're gonna send it yourself.
Put it down!

573
00:55:16,478 --> 00:55:19,772
-It's got blood!
-I see it. Carpy, I see it.

574
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:28,448
It's to my dad. It's got blood on it, Fish.

575
00:55:56,477 --> 00:55:59,020
We got him. Stay down.

576
00:56:07,738 --> 00:56:11,949
-How bad is it?
-Chest, maybe lung shot.

577
00:56:27,382 --> 00:56:29,926
Get that 30 up the street!

578
00:56:34,723 --> 00:56:35,973
Detail!

579
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:38,142
-Clear up!
-Clear down!

580
00:56:53,784 --> 00:56:56,702
That's why we can't take children.

581
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:06,337
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

582
00:57:06,421 --> 00:57:10,091
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

583
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:12,468
-Sergeant Hill.
-Yes, sir.

584
00:57:12,553 --> 00:57:16,931
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the northwest corner of the square.

585
00:57:17,015 --> 00:57:18,683
-Jackson!
-Sir.

586
00:57:18,767 --> 00:57:23,563
Mellish, check the tower,
hustle back here. Right now. Go!

587
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:37,034
Fuck Ryan.

588
00:57:47,546 --> 00:57:49,964
-Thunder!
-Flash!

589
00:57:50,048 --> 00:57:51,591
Come on in.

590
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:58,639
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

591
00:57:58,724 --> 00:58:00,474
Somewhere down there
across the square.

592
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:01,851
Across the square.

593
00:58:01,935 --> 00:58:04,520
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

594
00:58:05,105 --> 00:58:06,856
Sit down.

595
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:26,000
Jimmy T, go find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

596
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:27,418
What? Up there?

597
00:58:27,502 --> 00:58:30,254
How the hell should I know?
Would you go look, please?

598
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:32,298
Thank you, you moron.

599
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:35,259
All right.

600
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:38,804
You guys just flake out here for a while.

601
00:58:40,766 --> 00:58:44,226
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

602
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:56,030
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

603
00:58:56,114 --> 00:58:59,325
-Drop them now!
-Drop the fucking weapons!

604
00:59:02,162 --> 00:59:06,207
-I'll shoot you! I'll shoot you!
-Drop! Drop! Drop them!

605
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,045
Now! Put them down!

606
00:59:26,144 --> 00:59:27,561
Clear up!

607
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:36,570
-Shit. Shit!
-Clear up!

608
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:39,573
Clear down!

609
00:59:51,545 --> 00:59:55,297
-Enough to make you old.
-Let's hope so.

610
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:07,768
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders, 101 st.

611
01:00:07,853 --> 01:00:10,813
John Miller, 2nd Rangers. Thank you.

612
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:14,358
We're here looking
for a Private James Ryan.

613
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:17,445
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance at all you policed him up?

614
01:00:18,155 --> 01:00:20,698
-How was the road in?
-Scenic.

615
01:00:21,241 --> 01:00:24,952
-We lost most of our ammo.
-Not to mention one of our men.

616
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:28,706
Lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka
to the right side of the road.

617
01:00:28,957 --> 01:00:31,751
-Yes, sir!
-And get Ryan up here.

618
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:37,006
Ryan! Ryan, front and centre!

619
01:00:37,507 --> 01:00:38,799
Ryan!

620
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:44,472
Here comes our boy.

621
01:00:52,272 --> 01:00:54,982
Told you he was an asshole.

622
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:58,611
-Sir, Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
-At ease.

623
01:00:59,154 --> 01:01:02,531
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

624
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:05,659
This way.

625
01:01:06,495 --> 01:01:09,288
All right. Take a knee.

626
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,176
Private, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

627
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:33,562
Well, there isn't any real
easy way to say this, so...

628
01:01:35,941 --> 01:01:39,193
So I'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

629
01:01:40,612 --> 01:01:44,365
We have orders to come get you

630
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:47,535
because you're going home.

631
01:02:01,466 --> 01:02:04,093
Oh, my God. My brothers are dead.

632
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,187
I was supposed to take them fishing
when we got home.

633
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:32,079
I'm so sorry, James.
I can't tell you how much.

634
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:37,751
-How... How did they die?
-They were killed in action.

635
01:02:40,255 --> 01:02:43,173
That can't be. They're...

636
01:02:43,925 --> 01:02:47,887
That... That can't be.
My brothers are still in grammar school.

637
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:54,226
-You're James Ryan?
-Yeah.

638
01:02:55,353 --> 01:02:58,105
James Francis Ryan from Iowa?

639
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:01,150
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

640
01:03:08,074 --> 01:03:10,326
What? Does that mean
my brothers are okay?

641
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:12,119
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

642
01:03:12,203 --> 01:03:13,996
Are you sure they're okay, though?

643
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,497
We're looking
for a different Private Ryan.

644
01:03:15,582 --> 01:03:17,583
This is just a big foul-up.

645
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:19,543
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

646
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:23,756
How do you know the foul-up isn't
that his brothers are okay and that...

647
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,008
Lieutenant, I'm sorry for the trouble.

648
01:03:26,092 --> 01:03:30,262
I just wrote them a letter right
before I left. I got to get home.

649
01:03:31,556 --> 01:03:33,515
I got to get home right now.

650
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,101
-I wanna go home.
-Easy, now.

651
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,562
-So, where in the hell is our Ryan?
-I don't know.

652
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:40,731
Are you in touch with your CO?

653
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:42,691
-That figures.
-What unit's your Ryan in?

654
01:03:42,776 --> 01:03:44,985
Baker Company, 506th.

655
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:46,612
The guy with the broken foot,
he's 506, right?

656
01:03:46,696 --> 01:03:48,364
Yeah. Charlie, I think.

657
01:03:48,448 --> 01:03:50,115
-You think?
-Yeah.

658
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,452
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

659
01:03:53,536 --> 01:03:56,121
-Where was your drop zone?
-Just inside of Vierville.

660
01:03:56,206 --> 01:03:59,083
Vierville? How the hell did you
end up way up here?

661
01:03:59,167 --> 01:04:02,419
You got me, sir. C-47 took heavy fire.

662
01:04:02,504 --> 01:04:05,255
Pilot went crazy trying to get out
of there, turning every which way.

663
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:09,301
Took more fire on the drop.
Got messy. I ended up here.

664
01:04:09,386 --> 01:04:11,428
I haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

665
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:12,930
God knows where they are.

666
01:04:13,014 --> 01:04:14,723
Anybody from Baker Company
have, like, a big mouth?

667
01:04:14,808 --> 01:04:16,600
Talk about where the drop zone
might've been?

668
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:20,187
No, sir, but I know Baker Company
had the same rally point as us.

669
01:04:20,271 --> 01:04:21,522
Show me.

670
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:23,941
My men are beat.

671
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:25,985
We're gonna hold up here
for about three hours.

672
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:28,612
We'll pull out after dark.

673
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:31,615
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

674
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,910
Something with clean sheets
and soft pillows and room service?

675
01:04:34,995 --> 01:04:38,455
-How about a nice, comfy church?
-We'll take that.

676
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:41,375
What have you heard?
How's it all falling together?

677
01:04:41,459 --> 01:04:43,085
Well, we got the beachhead secure.

678
01:04:43,169 --> 01:04:45,796
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

679
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,132
We can't pull out till he's ready, so...

680
01:04:48,216 --> 01:04:50,843
-That guy's overrated.
-No argument here.

681
01:04:50,927 --> 01:04:53,721
You gotta take Caen,
so you can take Saint-Lô.

682
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:55,723
You got to take Saint-Lô
to take Valognes.

683
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,474
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

684
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:00,894
-Cherbourg, you got Paris.
-Paris, you get Berlin.

685
01:05:01,354 --> 01:05:03,731
And then that big boat home.

686
01:05:07,068 --> 01:05:08,610
We sure as hell
could use you around here,

687
01:05:08,695 --> 01:05:10,904
but I understand what you're doing.

688
01:05:10,989 --> 01:05:12,614
-You do?
-Yeah.

689
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:15,325
I got a couple of brothers myself.

690
01:05:15,869 --> 01:05:18,412
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

691
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:22,750
No, I mean it. Find him. Get him home.

692
01:05:31,176 --> 01:05:33,177
What's with your hand?

693
01:05:34,637 --> 01:05:36,472
I don't know.

694
01:05:38,183 --> 01:05:39,516
It started in Portsmouth

695
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:41,268
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

696
01:05:41,394 --> 01:05:42,853
It comes and goes.

697
01:05:42,937 --> 01:05:45,856
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

698
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,318
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.

699
01:05:54,616 --> 01:05:55,949
What?

700
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,164
-What?
-Nothing.

701
01:06:02,957 --> 01:06:05,709
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

702
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:08,295
The one that was always walking
around on his hands, you know?

703
01:06:08,421 --> 01:06:12,007
And he was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze.

704
01:06:12,092 --> 01:06:13,801
-Vecchio.
-Vecchio.

705
01:06:20,391 --> 01:06:21,725
Yeah, Vecchio.

706
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,685
He was a goofy kid.

707
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,440
Remember, he used to pee
a "V" on everybody's jacket

708
01:06:28,525 --> 01:06:31,819
for Vecchio, for victory.

709
01:06:36,449 --> 01:06:40,202
He was so short.
He was a midget, wasn't he?

710
01:06:40,286 --> 01:06:43,038
"How did you get to be a Ranger?"

711
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:46,625
He got shot in the foot once, didn't he,
when he was walking on his hands?

712
01:06:46,709 --> 01:06:49,670
Yeah. He could walk
faster on his hands.

713
01:06:50,797 --> 01:06:53,841
He could run faster on his hands than...

714
01:06:56,761 --> 01:06:58,137
Vecchio.

715
01:06:59,264 --> 01:07:00,514
Yeah.

716
01:07:02,183 --> 01:07:03,517
Caparzo.

717
01:07:10,024 --> 01:07:14,945
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men,

718
01:07:15,822 --> 01:07:18,949
you tell yourself it happened

719
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:24,663
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

720
01:07:26,332 --> 01:07:28,375
Maybe 100 others.

721
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:35,549
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

722
01:07:35,633 --> 01:07:37,885
-How many?
-Ninety-four.

723
01:07:39,262 --> 01:07:45,058
But that means I've saved the lives
of 10 times that many, doesn't it?

724
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:49,438
Maybe even 20, right?
Twenty times as many?

725
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,905
And that's how simple it is.

726
01:07:58,823 --> 01:08:00,532
That's how you...

727
01:08:01,868 --> 01:08:04,536
That's how you rationalise
making the choice

728
01:08:04,621 --> 01:08:07,122
between the mission and the men.

729
01:08:07,582 --> 01:08:10,667
Except this time, the mission is a man.

730
01:08:13,963 --> 01:08:16,423
This Ryan better be worth it.

731
01:08:19,427 --> 01:08:22,221
He'd better go home,
cure some disease,

732
01:08:22,305 --> 01:08:25,807
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

733
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:28,310
'Cause the truth is
I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans

734
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:31,188
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

735
01:08:31,272 --> 01:08:32,606
Amen.

736
01:08:34,984 --> 01:08:37,110
Look. There it goes again.

737
01:08:38,154 --> 01:08:41,114
Sir, are you all right?

738
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:49,665
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

739
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:52,042
Why don't you get some sleep?

740
01:08:52,126 --> 01:08:55,170
-I don't know how he does it.
-What's that?

741
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:57,923
Falls asleep like that.
I mean, look at him.

742
01:08:58,007 --> 01:09:01,051
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

743
01:09:01,135 --> 01:09:02,719
Clear conscience.

744
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:04,388
Yeah. What's that saying?

745
01:09:04,472 --> 01:09:07,641
"If God's on our side,
who the hell could be on theirs?"

746
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:10,310
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

747
01:09:10,395 --> 01:09:12,521
Yeah, what did I say?

748
01:09:12,605 --> 01:09:16,858
Well, actually, the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

749
01:09:16,943 --> 01:09:18,735
How is that, Wade?

750
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:23,782
Well, when my mother was an intern,
she used to work late through the night,

751
01:09:23,866 --> 01:09:26,410
sleep through the day.

752
01:09:26,494 --> 01:09:28,328
So the only time that we ever got
to talk about anything

753
01:09:28,413 --> 01:09:29,871
was when she'd get home.

754
01:09:29,956 --> 01:09:32,499
So what I used to do,
I used to lie in my bed

755
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:34,084
and try to stay awake as long as I could,

756
01:09:34,168 --> 01:09:37,921
but it never worked
'cause the harder I tried,

757
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:40,215
the faster I'd fall asleep.

758
01:09:41,592 --> 01:09:43,427
Yeah. Well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.

759
01:09:43,511 --> 01:09:45,804
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

760
01:09:45,888 --> 01:09:47,723
chatted me up till dawn.

761
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:50,350
I swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

762
01:09:50,435 --> 01:09:54,438
Yeah. That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

763
01:09:58,484 --> 01:10:02,029
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

764
01:10:02,113 --> 01:10:04,781
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

765
01:10:04,866 --> 01:10:08,493
-Who? Your mum?
-Yeah.

766
01:10:11,205 --> 01:10:14,207
She'd stand in the doorway,
looking at me.

767
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,085
And I'd just keep my eyes shut.

768
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:23,467
And I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

769
01:10:24,052 --> 01:10:26,511
that she came home early

770
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:29,890
just to talk to me.

771
01:10:33,102 --> 01:10:37,314
And I still wouldn't move.
I'd still pretend to just be asleep.

772
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,823
I don't know why I did that.

773
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:03,965
We only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

774
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:15,602
Captain? Sir?

775
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:19,106
Corporal?

776
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,406
How you doing there? Are you all right?

777
01:11:27,573 --> 01:11:30,575
Yeah, I think this is all good for me, sir.

778
01:11:31,994 --> 01:11:33,453
Really?

779
01:11:34,205 --> 01:11:35,705
How is that?

780
01:11:39,627 --> 01:11:42,170
"War educates the senses,

781
01:11:42,255 --> 01:11:44,214
"calls into action the will,

782
01:11:44,298 --> 01:11:47,008
"perfects the physical constitution,

783
01:11:47,385 --> 01:11:50,262
"brings men into such swift
and close collision

784
01:11:50,346 --> 01:11:53,473
"in critical moments
that man measures man."

785
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:56,643
Yeah. Well, I guess
that's Emerson's way

786
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:58,895
of finding the bright side.

787
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,649
-You know Emerson, sir?
-I know some.

788
01:12:07,113 --> 01:12:11,158
So, where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

789
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:15,495
What's the pool up to?

790
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:21,668
You know, I think it's around 300, sir.

791
01:12:22,503 --> 01:12:25,172
Well, when it gets up to 500,

792
01:12:25,256 --> 01:12:27,507
I'll give you the answers,
and we'll split the money.

793
01:12:27,592 --> 01:12:29,593
How about that?

794
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:33,263
Well, if that's the way you feel, sir.
I feel it's my duty under your command

795
01:12:33,347 --> 01:12:37,601
to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1 ,000, sir.

796
01:12:39,312 --> 01:12:41,813
What if we don't live that long?

797
01:12:44,984 --> 01:12:48,069
-500?
-500 would be good, yeah.

798
01:12:48,154 --> 01:12:50,113
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

799
01:12:52,742 --> 01:12:55,494
-Get some sleep, Corporal.
-Yes, sir.

800
01:14:02,103 --> 01:14:04,312
Who's got sulfa powder?

801
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:10,860
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet!

802
01:14:10,945 --> 01:14:12,445
-Wade.
-Yes, sir?

803
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,489
-See what you can do.
-Yes, sir.

804
01:14:14,574 --> 01:14:17,909
Hold on, fellas. It won't be much longer.

805
01:14:18,077 --> 01:14:19,953
How we doing here?

806
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,871
All right.

807
01:14:21,956 --> 01:14:24,499
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

808
01:14:24,584 --> 01:14:26,334
Doc's in town.

809
01:14:26,794 --> 01:14:27,877
It's all right. It's all right.

810
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:29,462
Don't worry, fellas.

811
01:14:29,547 --> 01:14:32,090
The 29th Infantry's breaking through,
they'll be here soon.

812
01:14:32,174 --> 01:14:34,551
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

813
01:14:34,635 --> 01:14:38,471
-Captain. Hey, Captain.
-Soldier, you want to fill me in?

814
01:14:38,556 --> 01:14:40,515
Yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

815
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:44,227
99th Troop Carrier Squadron,
carrying in 327th Glider Infantry.

816
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:45,895
This one was mine, sir.

817
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,397
-I was the pilot.
-Private?

818
01:14:47,481 --> 01:14:48,982
-Twenty-two men dead.
-Private, take care of...

819
01:14:49,066 --> 01:14:51,901
I ended up over there without a scratch.
It took my co-pilot's head right off.

820
01:14:51,986 --> 01:14:53,612
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

821
01:14:53,696 --> 01:14:56,698
Well, the guys we came in with, sir,
they headed off first night.

822
01:14:56,782 --> 01:14:58,074
Haven't seen them since.

823
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:02,203
Meantime, other guys keep showing up,
one, two, half-dozen at a time.

824
01:15:02,288 --> 01:15:05,081
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

825
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:07,626
-head off to make trouble, sir.
-Water. I need a canteen over here.

826
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,711
We're looking for a Private James Ryan.

827
01:15:09,795 --> 01:15:12,047
He's in Baker Company,
the 506 of the 101 st.

828
01:15:12,131 --> 01:15:14,466
No, you got me, sir.
A lot of guys come in and out of here.

829
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:16,009
-Upham.
-Yes, sir.

830
01:15:16,093 --> 01:15:17,927
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

831
01:15:18,012 --> 01:15:19,679
Yes, sir.

832
01:15:21,057 --> 01:15:22,515
Reiben.

833
01:15:23,017 --> 01:15:27,062
Smell that leg right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

834
01:15:32,693 --> 01:15:34,027
What?

835
01:15:39,492 --> 01:15:40,867
Keep moving.

836
01:15:40,951 --> 01:15:42,827
Keep moving!

837
01:15:43,746 --> 01:15:46,122
I'm Juden, you know?

838
01:15:48,376 --> 01:15:50,960
Yeah, I couldn't pry him out of there,
hard as I tried.

839
01:15:51,045 --> 01:15:53,254
-I'd need a winch.
-Yeah.

840
01:15:57,385 --> 01:15:58,677
Stars.

841
01:15:59,053 --> 01:16:03,598
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,
Deputy Commander, 101 st.

842
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:06,976
Some fucking genius had the great idea

843
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:08,603
of welding a couple of steel plates

844
01:16:08,688 --> 01:16:11,981
onto our deck to keep
the general safe from ground fire.

845
01:16:12,066 --> 01:16:13,650
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me about it

846
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:16,152
until we were just getting airborne.

847
01:16:16,237 --> 01:16:19,239
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train. Okay.

848
01:16:19,865 --> 01:16:23,243
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

849
01:16:23,619 --> 01:16:26,621
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

850
01:16:26,706 --> 01:16:28,832
And when we released,

851
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:31,209
you know, I cut as hard as I could,

852
01:16:31,293 --> 01:16:34,796
tried to gain some altitude
and still keep her from stalling.

853
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,050
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

854
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:44,514
And the others, they stopped easy
enough okay though, you know?

855
01:16:44,598 --> 01:16:48,351
We were just... We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

856
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:50,270
The grass was wet.

857
01:16:51,105 --> 01:16:53,231
Downward slope and all.

858
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:55,859
Twenty-two guys dead.

859
01:16:58,654 --> 01:17:02,157
-All that for a general?
-One man.

860
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:07,704
-A lot of that going around.
-FUBAR.

861
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:10,290
-FUBAR.
-FUBAR.

862
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:12,459
FUBAR.

863
01:17:12,543 --> 01:17:14,669
You all got that right.

864
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:17,088
Hey, I looked up "FUBAR"
in the German dictionary.

865
01:17:17,173 --> 01:17:18,214
There's no "FUBAR" in there.

866
01:17:18,299 --> 01:17:19,549
-Upham.
-Yes, sir?

867
01:17:19,633 --> 01:17:22,218
There's more paratroops out there.
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

868
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,720
Yes, sir.

869
01:17:23,804 --> 01:17:26,473
Oh, you might want
to check these out, sir.

870
01:17:26,557 --> 01:17:28,099
Dog tags.

871
01:17:28,184 --> 01:17:31,102
More than I really want to count, sir.

872
01:17:32,313 --> 01:17:35,148
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

873
01:17:35,316 --> 01:17:36,691
Jackson.

874
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:40,153
-Start going through those.
-Yes, sir.

875
01:17:41,405 --> 01:17:42,989
I'll help.

876
01:17:45,201 --> 01:17:47,744
What do you think, Jackson?
Do you think that little prick's in there?

877
01:17:47,828 --> 01:17:50,830
Well, if he is, I'm gonna find him.
I bet that son of a bitch is here.

878
01:17:50,915 --> 01:17:52,832
I got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

879
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:55,043
10 bucks says I nail him first.

880
01:17:55,127 --> 01:17:57,754
-Let's see who we got in here.
-You mugs don't stand a chance.

881
01:17:57,838 --> 01:17:59,714
All right, you think this little
shit bird is in here or what?

882
01:17:59,799 --> 01:18:01,508
Just keep looking.

883
01:18:01,967 --> 01:18:04,135
All right. Gary Ianico.

884
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,012
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

885
01:18:06,096 --> 01:18:07,889
I swear.
All the guineas are buying it, huh?

886
01:18:07,973 --> 01:18:09,766
Oh, come on, not the right name.

887
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:12,852
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.

888
01:18:13,103 --> 01:18:15,480
We gotta find this prick.

889
01:18:19,819 --> 01:18:21,653
Where is this son of a bitch?

890
01:18:21,737 --> 01:18:24,280
Don't mix them up, Jackson, all right?
Keep them in your own fucking pile.

891
01:18:24,365 --> 01:18:26,699
How am I supposed to know
who we got?

892
01:18:26,784 --> 01:18:29,452
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben? All right.

893
01:18:29,537 --> 01:18:33,039
-Everybody be friends.
-Cranky there, huh?

894
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:36,960
-I think I got a winner.
-What you talking about?

895
01:18:37,044 --> 01:18:38,503
Ryan.

896
01:18:38,712 --> 01:18:41,297
-Ryan.
-Take a look at that, Mellish.

897
01:18:41,841 --> 01:18:43,132
You know what?
You're a genius. You really are.

898
01:18:43,217 --> 01:18:45,051
R-I-E-N-N-E.

899
01:18:45,135 --> 01:18:47,095
That's Rienne and that's French.
All right.

900
01:18:47,179 --> 01:18:49,264
-You know what that means?
-It means nothing.

901
01:18:49,348 --> 01:18:51,307
-What beats three of a kind?
-I got shit here.

902
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:55,103
-I got all guys from New York.
-I got a full house.

903
01:18:55,187 --> 01:18:57,313
-Do you need a hand with that?
-I got a full house.

904
01:18:57,398 --> 01:18:59,983
-I got you beat. I got the straight flush.
-Full house, he's got.

905
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:03,444
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

906
01:19:03,529 --> 01:19:05,655
-Ryan.
-Fucking unreal, this guy.

907
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:08,324
Do you need a hand with that?
Can you read that shit?

908
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:10,994
Jesus Christ. Look at this poor bastard.

909
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:14,163
-I guess they're not bullet-proof, huh?
-Guess not. All right?

910
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:15,665
I don't like
what he's got between his ears.

911
01:19:15,749 --> 01:19:18,668
Sort of like what you fellas got
between your legs.

912
01:19:18,752 --> 01:19:20,837
-We got to give him that.
-That's not bad.

913
01:19:20,921 --> 01:19:22,422
Not bad with you, Jackson.

914
01:19:22,506 --> 01:19:24,507
All right, I got three of a kind. All right.

915
01:19:24,592 --> 01:19:25,758
-Full house.
-What the hell are you doing?

916
01:19:25,843 --> 01:19:28,344
The whole goddamn
Airborne's watching.

917
01:19:28,429 --> 01:19:29,888
These aren't poker chips.

918
01:19:29,972 --> 01:19:33,808
-All right, all right, all right.
-Put them back in there!

919
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:59,000
He's not here.

920
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:05,840
Maybe we should bust up
into a couple of different groups, huh?

921
01:20:05,966 --> 01:20:07,175
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

922
01:20:07,301 --> 01:20:08,343
calling his name.

923
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:11,596
He's bound to hear us sooner
or later. Ryan!

924
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,849
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

925
01:20:15,559 --> 01:20:18,811
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Hey, you know...

926
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:24,651
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101 st Airborne?

927
01:20:24,735 --> 01:20:28,529
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?
Private James Ryan from Iowa?

928
01:20:28,656 --> 01:20:30,657
Anybody know a Ryan?

929
01:20:31,158 --> 01:20:33,076
James Ryan!

930
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:39,123
Hey, Joe, doesn't Mandelsohn pal
around with a Ryan from C Company?

931
01:20:39,208 --> 01:20:42,502
-Yeah. I think so.
-Bring him up here, would you?

932
01:20:51,845 --> 01:20:54,389
-Do you know Private Ryan?
-You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

933
01:20:54,515 --> 01:20:55,682
You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

934
01:20:55,766 --> 01:20:57,433
-My hearing is not good!
-It comes and goes!

935
01:20:57,518 --> 01:20:58,726
-It comes and goes!
-A German grenade went off

936
01:20:58,852 --> 01:21:00,645
-next to his ear.
-A grenade went off right by my head!

937
01:21:00,729 --> 01:21:03,773
Got it, got it. Do you know Private Ryan?

938
01:21:03,857 --> 01:21:05,316
Who?

939
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:07,860
Private Ryan! James Ryan!

940
01:21:07,945 --> 01:21:12,156
-Jimmy Ryan?
-James! James Francis Ryan!

941
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:16,077
-No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.
-All right. Get me a pencil.

942
01:21:16,203 --> 01:21:18,496
Something to write on.
Something to write on.

943
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:21,082
Quick! Quick! Come on, a pencil!

944
01:21:22,876 --> 01:21:24,627
A small one, sir.

945
01:21:25,254 --> 01:21:26,379
Write this down.

946
01:21:26,463 --> 01:21:28,423
James Francis Ryan, question mark.

947
01:21:28,549 --> 01:21:30,299
Iowa, question mark.

948
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:32,885
Do you know him? Does he know him?

949
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:35,054
Read the message. Look.

950
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:40,893
-Yeah. Of course I know him, sir.
-Does he know where he is?

951
01:21:44,732 --> 01:21:48,109
Yeah, yeah. We missed
our drop zone by about 20 miles,

952
01:21:48,235 --> 01:21:51,529
ended up way over
by Bumville or some damn place.

953
01:21:51,613 --> 01:21:54,741
Him, me and a couple of other guys
were coming here to the rally point,

954
01:21:54,825 --> 01:21:59,996
ran into a Colonel who was gathering
up men to go to Ramelle.

955
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:01,414
Ramelle.

956
01:22:01,498 --> 01:22:03,958
To baby-sit a bridge.
That's the last I've seen of him, sir.

957
01:22:04,084 --> 01:22:05,960
Great! Great! Thank you.

958
01:22:06,086 --> 01:22:08,337
Write thank... Read, and thank you.

959
01:22:08,422 --> 01:22:10,923
-You're welcome!
-Assemble on me.

960
01:22:13,093 --> 01:22:15,094
Thank you, Lieutenant.

961
01:22:17,681 --> 01:22:19,098
Ramelle.

962
01:22:20,642 --> 01:22:22,810
We're here. There.

963
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:28,524
Ramelle is on the Merderet River,
right here, just to the southwest of us.

964
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:30,985
You know anything about this bridge
he was talking about, Captain?

965
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:34,947
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

966
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:39,202
We can't push on Paris
until we take a deep water port.

967
01:22:39,286 --> 01:22:41,079
And Rommel knows that,

968
01:22:41,163 --> 01:22:42,747
so he's gonna try to get his armour

969
01:22:42,831 --> 01:22:46,209
across the Merderet river
anywhere he can.

970
01:22:46,293 --> 01:22:48,294
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

971
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:51,047
when we make
the big right turn to Cherbourg.

972
01:22:51,131 --> 01:22:52,840
That makes any village on that river

973
01:22:52,966 --> 01:22:56,219
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

974
01:23:16,907 --> 01:23:18,324
Let's go.

975
01:23:27,835 --> 01:23:29,168
Captain.

976
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:09,500
What the hell is that?

977
01:24:10,711 --> 01:24:13,838
A radar site. It's gotta be out of action.

978
01:24:13,922 --> 01:24:18,718
Looks like we got something in that.
Sandbag bunker right under the station.

979
01:24:19,887 --> 01:24:22,763
-See it?
-Yeah. That's my guess, too.

980
01:24:24,183 --> 01:24:25,933
What is it?

981
01:24:26,602 --> 01:24:28,895
Machine gun. Probably MG42.

982
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:31,272
Jesus. Is that what got those guys?

983
01:24:31,356 --> 01:24:33,274
Maybe one of them's our boy.

984
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,777
No, their patches are 82nd,
so your luck's not that good.

985
01:24:36,862 --> 01:24:38,946
Yeah, well, I don't know how fast
the rest of you betties are,

986
01:24:39,031 --> 01:24:41,532
but I'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

987
01:24:41,617 --> 01:24:44,660
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

988
01:24:44,745 --> 01:24:48,331
So, Captain, what I'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

989
01:24:48,415 --> 01:24:51,834
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

990
01:24:53,462 --> 01:24:55,338
I'm with Reiben on this one, sir.

991
01:24:55,422 --> 01:24:59,550
-I mean, we left them 88s.
-For the Air Force.

992
01:24:59,635 --> 01:25:03,721
The Air Force isn't gonna spend
ordnance on one machine gun.

993
01:25:04,181 --> 01:25:05,640
Captain...

994
01:25:06,683 --> 01:25:08,517
We can still skip it
and accomplish our mission.

995
01:25:08,602 --> 01:25:11,604
I mean, this isn't our mission, right, sir?

996
01:25:11,688 --> 01:25:13,898
Oh. That's what
you want to do, Mellish?

997
01:25:13,982 --> 01:25:15,441
You just want to leave it here,
so they can ambush

998
01:25:15,525 --> 01:25:16,817
the next company that comes along?

999
01:25:16,902 --> 01:25:18,277
No, sir. That's not what I'm saying.

1000
01:25:18,362 --> 01:25:21,155
I'm simply saying
it seems like an unnecessary risk,

1001
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,698
given our objective, sir.

1002
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:25,534
Our objective is to win the war.

1003
01:25:28,747 --> 01:25:32,750
Sir, I just... I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1004
01:25:35,254 --> 01:25:38,965
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1005
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:03,030
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1006
01:26:03,156 --> 01:26:06,325
Mellish, you hook to the right.
I'll go up the middle.

1007
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:16,419
Who's going left?

1008
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:22,258
I'll do it.

1009
01:26:23,218 --> 01:26:25,803
-I'll go left.
-All right.

1010
01:26:25,887 --> 01:26:28,681
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1011
01:26:28,765 --> 01:26:30,224
Yes, sir.

1012
01:26:30,934 --> 01:26:35,771
We advance and keep pressure on him
till he has to change out his barrels.

1013
01:26:36,606 --> 01:26:38,566
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1014
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:42,945
-Maybe I should go up the middle, sir.
-The way you run? I don't think so.

1015
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:46,782
-Maybe I should go left, sir.
-Maybe you should shut up.

1016
01:26:47,576 --> 01:26:49,952
Reiben, base of fire.

1017
01:26:58,337 --> 01:27:01,255
Mags and clips where
you can reach them, and...

1018
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:04,300
And extra grenades
for the base runners.

1019
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:30,886
Hill's clear! Four down and dead!

1020
01:28:30,971 --> 01:28:35,975
Upham, grab the gear. Get up here!
We need water and extra dressing now!

1021
01:28:36,059 --> 01:28:41,772
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1022
01:28:50,574 --> 01:28:51,615
God.

1023
01:28:52,284 --> 01:28:53,492
Son of a bitch!

1024
01:28:53,577 --> 01:28:54,827
All right. The sulfa.

1025
01:28:54,953 --> 01:28:56,579
-Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
-I got him.

1026
01:28:56,663 --> 01:28:58,247
-More sulfa, Mellish.
-I got him. I got him, Wade.

1027
01:28:58,331 --> 01:28:59,748
-You're gonna be all right.
-Listen to my voice.

1028
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:01,083
You're gonna be all right, Doc.

1029
01:29:01,168 --> 01:29:02,751
How's it look? How's it look?

1030
01:29:02,836 --> 01:29:04,753
Wade, you're fine.
You're going on a hospital ship.

1031
01:29:04,838 --> 01:29:06,755
-More sulfa! More sulfa!
-Put my legs up.

1032
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,091
-Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
-He's gonna be all right.

1033
01:29:09,176 --> 01:29:11,594
-I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em.
-You're gonna be okay, Wade.

1034
01:29:11,678 --> 01:29:13,012
I got 'em.

1035
01:29:13,138 --> 01:29:15,848
Upham, give me your canteen!

1036
01:29:15,974 --> 01:29:17,766
-Come on. Come on.
-...we're gonna get you out of here.

1037
01:29:17,851 --> 01:29:18,934
Put some pressure on it.

1038
01:29:19,019 --> 01:29:21,896
-You're gonna be okay.
-How's it look?

1039
01:29:22,022 --> 01:29:23,772
-I'm getting some morphine.
-How's it look?

1040
01:29:23,857 --> 01:29:26,317
-It's all right. You're gonna be okay.
-How's it look?

1041
01:29:26,401 --> 01:29:28,110
You're gonna be okay.

1042
01:29:28,195 --> 01:29:30,070
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

1043
01:29:30,197 --> 01:29:33,199
Am I shot in the spine?

1044
01:29:33,325 --> 01:29:35,868
-You're okay, Wade.
-Am I shot in the spine?

1045
01:29:35,994 --> 01:29:38,037
-Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.
-All right. Flip him over.

1046
01:29:38,163 --> 01:29:39,330
-Easy, easy, easy.
-Put some pressure.

1047
01:29:39,414 --> 01:29:41,999
-Easy, easy.
-Lift him up. Lift him up.

1048
01:29:44,544 --> 01:29:47,546
It's okay, doc. It's all right.

1049
01:29:47,672 --> 01:29:50,174
Wade, you got an exit wound.

1050
01:29:50,258 --> 01:29:52,009
It's in the small of your back.

1051
01:29:52,093 --> 01:29:54,428
How big's the hole in the...

1052
01:29:54,554 --> 01:29:56,472
-About the size of an acorn.
-It's fine.

1053
01:29:56,556 --> 01:29:58,599
You're fine. You're fine.

1054
01:30:00,227 --> 01:30:04,104
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

1055
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:08,400
-Put some pressure on it.
-It's all right.

1056
01:30:08,527 --> 01:30:11,237
Put some more pressure on it!

1057
01:30:11,738 --> 01:30:14,114
Is there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

1058
01:30:14,241 --> 01:30:15,991
Yeah, right here, right here.
Do you know what it is?

1059
01:30:16,076 --> 01:30:17,493
-No.
-Right here. Yeah. Right here.

1060
01:30:17,577 --> 01:30:19,203
I'm gonna put your hand on it.

1061
01:30:19,287 --> 01:30:21,080
-We got some pressure on there.
-Right there.

1062
01:30:21,206 --> 01:30:23,332
-That's good.
-Okay. That's the one.

1063
01:30:23,416 --> 01:30:25,209
Oh, my God, my liver!

1064
01:30:25,293 --> 01:30:28,212
-Oh, my God! It's my liver!
-Something wrong, Wade.

1065
01:30:28,296 --> 01:30:29,672
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

1066
01:30:29,756 --> 01:30:31,632
What do you need? What do you need?
What can we do, Wade?

1067
01:30:31,758 --> 01:30:33,968
Tell us what to do.

1068
01:30:34,094 --> 01:30:35,344
Oh, shit.

1069
01:30:35,428 --> 01:30:39,932
I could use... I could use
a little more morphine.

1070
01:30:40,642 --> 01:30:42,434
More morphine, sir?

1071
01:30:43,436 --> 01:30:45,896
Okay. Okay.

1072
01:30:49,568 --> 01:30:55,114
Give it to him.

1073
01:30:59,452 --> 01:31:02,162
-I don't wanna die.
-Here you go. Wade, here you go.

1074
01:31:02,289 --> 01:31:05,708
-Here it comes.
-There you go. There you...

1075
01:31:09,004 --> 01:31:10,963
Give him another one.

1076
01:31:18,054 --> 01:31:23,309
Mama?

1077
01:31:24,144 --> 01:31:27,062
I want to go home. I want to go home.

1078
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:31,692
Mama. Mama.

1079
01:31:31,818 --> 01:31:34,653
Mama, Mama, Mama...

1080
01:32:17,447 --> 01:32:19,198
Reiben, hold him!

1081
01:32:39,928 --> 01:32:41,303
Not yet.

1082
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:47,893
First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail.

1083
01:32:48,395 --> 01:32:51,397
Same thing
for those paratroopers down there.

1084
01:32:51,815 --> 01:32:54,274
Strip that stuff off
and check him for intelligence.

1085
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:58,570
Ask this piece of shit
if he's the one who shot Wade. Ask him!

1086
01:32:58,655 --> 01:33:01,365
-It doesn't matter.
-It does matter!

1087
01:33:03,785 --> 01:33:06,370
Shut up with that filthy pig latin.

1088
01:33:08,456 --> 01:33:10,374
Jackson, you're hit.

1089
01:33:12,544 --> 01:33:13,794
Shit.

1090
01:33:14,379 --> 01:33:17,715
-I guess it just skinned the arm, sir.
-Get it cleaned and dressed.

1091
01:33:17,799 --> 01:33:20,342
You and Sarge, watch the perimeter.

1092
01:33:23,388 --> 01:33:27,933
-Sir, he says, "Please don't shoot."
-I don't care what he says, Upham.

1093
01:33:28,685 --> 01:33:31,729
Sir? Sir, you're gonna let them kill him?

1094
01:33:32,731 --> 01:33:36,984
-This is not right, sir.
-You can help him with the bodies.

1095
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,155
What is happening?

1096
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:33,016
American.

1097
01:35:34,936 --> 01:35:36,687
I like American.

1098
01:35:44,237 --> 01:35:48,156
Steamboat Willie.

1099
01:35:48,241 --> 01:35:50,909
Yeah, Steamboat Willie. American.

1100
01:36:02,422 --> 01:36:04,798
-He's says he's not finished.
-Yeah. That's what you think.

1101
01:36:04,883 --> 01:36:06,633
Come on. Yeah.

1102
01:36:16,561 --> 01:36:19,938
Please... I like America.

1103
01:36:21,274 --> 01:36:23,483
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

1104
01:36:23,568 --> 01:36:27,237
Go fly a kite!
Cat got your tongue? Cool beans!

1105
01:36:30,950 --> 01:36:33,118
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1106
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,914
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1107
01:36:43,588 --> 01:36:48,800
I say can you see
I say can you see

1108
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,386
I say...

1109
01:36:58,394 --> 01:37:03,690
Fuck Hitler.

1110
01:37:12,533 --> 01:37:15,118
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade.

1111
01:37:15,203 --> 01:37:17,245
He says he's sorry about Wade, sir.

1112
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:18,997
Captain.

1113
01:37:19,123 --> 01:37:20,999
Captain, this isn't right.

1114
01:37:21,084 --> 01:37:24,628
You know this. He's a prisoner.
He surrendered.

1115
01:37:25,338 --> 01:37:27,297
He surrendered, sir!

1116
01:37:37,976 --> 01:37:39,685
Tell him

1117
01:37:41,688 --> 01:37:45,023
to march 1 ,000 paces in that direction,

1118
01:37:45,149 --> 01:37:46,358
then he can take off the blindfold.

1119
01:37:46,484 --> 01:37:47,526
We'll be gone, and he turns himself in

1120
01:37:47,652 --> 01:37:49,444
to the first Allied patrol
he comes across.

1121
01:37:49,529 --> 01:37:50,529
-Thank you, sir.
-You gotta be kidding me.

1122
01:37:50,655 --> 01:37:53,448
-We're letting him go?
-He's a POW, Reiben.

1123
01:37:53,533 --> 01:37:57,869
Can't take him with us.
Our guys'll pick him up sooner or later.

1124
01:38:08,548 --> 01:38:10,799
Only if he doesn't get picked up
by his own Wehrmacht first,

1125
01:38:10,883 --> 01:38:13,552
then thrown back into circulation.

1126
01:38:15,722 --> 01:38:18,140
Captain, you just let the enemy go.

1127
01:38:18,224 --> 01:38:21,143
-This is such bullshit.
-Y'all got that right.

1128
01:38:21,227 --> 01:38:23,228
Bullshit? Right. This is bullshit?

1129
01:38:23,354 --> 01:38:25,397
-Shooting a prisoner, that'd be okay?
-Upham, shut your mouth.

1130
01:38:25,523 --> 01:38:26,565
It's against the goddamn rules!

1131
01:38:26,691 --> 01:38:30,736
Yeah. The goddamn rules
just walked off with your new friend.

1132
01:38:32,655 --> 01:38:36,908
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do, huh, Captain?

1133
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:46,043
Get your gear. Let's go.

1134
01:38:48,504 --> 01:38:50,589
You heard him. Gear up.

1135
01:38:51,924 --> 01:38:53,759
The Captain just gave you an order.

1136
01:38:53,843 --> 01:38:57,679
Yeah. Like the one he gave
to take this machine gun.

1137
01:38:57,764 --> 01:39:00,891
-That was a real doozy, wasn't it, Sarge.
-Soldier, you are way out of line.

1138
01:39:00,975 --> 01:39:04,227
Yes, sir. That was one hell of a call,
coming to take this nest,

1139
01:39:04,312 --> 01:39:07,064
but what the hell? We only lost
one of our guys, going for it.

1140
01:39:07,148 --> 01:39:09,483
I swear, I hope Mama Ryan's
real fucking happy,

1141
01:39:09,609 --> 01:39:13,153
knowing that little Jimmy's life is a little
bit more important than two of our guys!

1142
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:16,239
But then again, we haven't
found him yet, have we? Huh?

1143
01:39:18,284 --> 01:39:19,659
-Here you go.
-Get the hell off me!

1144
01:39:19,786 --> 01:39:21,495
Reiben, get up.

1145
01:39:23,289 --> 01:39:26,416
Gear up. Fall in.

1146
01:39:31,464 --> 01:39:33,673
I'm done with this mission.

1147
01:39:38,638 --> 01:39:40,305
Hey! Hey!

1148
01:39:42,266 --> 01:39:44,309
-Sir.
-Don't walk away from your Captain.

1149
01:39:44,435 --> 01:39:46,686
-Reiben, get back in line.
-No, sir.

1150
01:39:46,813 --> 01:39:48,146
I'll spend the rest
of my life in the stockade

1151
01:39:48,272 --> 01:39:49,564
if I have to, but I'm done with this.

1152
01:39:49,649 --> 01:39:51,942
-I'm not gonna ask you again, soldier.
-Captain!

1153
01:39:52,026 --> 01:39:53,360
All right, now. This is bullshit!

1154
01:39:53,486 --> 01:39:55,946
-Fall in!
-You're gonna shoot me over Ryan?

1155
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:57,405
No. I'm gonna shoot you
'cause I don't like you.

1156
01:39:57,490 --> 01:40:00,450
-Sir, listen...
-Sir, if he wants to go, just let him go!

1157
01:40:00,535 --> 01:40:03,870
Are you letting this happen?
Captain! You see this?

1158
01:40:03,996 --> 01:40:07,040
-Captain? Sir? Sir, Ryan's dead.
-Bullshit!

1159
01:40:07,166 --> 01:40:09,584
-Sir, we have a situation you might...
-That is bullshit!

1160
01:40:09,669 --> 01:40:12,170
Captain, I have a sixth sense about
these things. I know it in my bones.

1161
01:40:12,296 --> 01:40:15,173
We don't kill that son-of-a-bitch kraut.
Now you're gonna shoot me?

1162
01:40:15,299 --> 01:40:17,717
-He's better than you.
-Then why don't you just do it, Sarge?

1163
01:40:17,844 --> 01:40:19,511
Do it, man. Put one in my leg
and give me that...

1164
01:40:19,595 --> 01:40:22,264
I'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1165
01:40:22,348 --> 01:40:23,765
Well, put your money
where your mouth is...

1166
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:25,267
-You don't know when to shut up.
-Do it!

1167
01:40:25,351 --> 01:40:26,935
-You don't know how to shut up.
-Pull the trigger, already!

1168
01:40:27,019 --> 01:40:28,353
Captain, please!

1169
01:40:28,479 --> 01:40:31,690
-What's the pool on me up to?
-What?

1170
01:40:31,816 --> 01:40:34,526
-You are a coward son of a bitch!
-I'm waiting, Sarge.

1171
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:38,280
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to right now?

1172
01:40:38,364 --> 01:40:40,157
What's it up to?

1173
01:40:40,783 --> 01:40:45,370
What is it, $300? Is that it? 300?
I'm a schoolteacher.

1174
01:40:49,959 --> 01:40:52,210
I teach English composition

1175
01:40:53,546 --> 01:40:55,714
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1176
01:40:55,798 --> 01:40:57,549
The last 1 1 years,

1177
01:40:58,384 --> 01:41:01,386
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1178
01:41:03,306 --> 01:41:06,975
I was the coach of the baseball team
in the springtime.

1179
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,188
I'll be doggone.

1180
01:41:11,898 --> 01:41:15,150
Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1181
01:41:15,234 --> 01:41:18,153
they'd think, "Well, that figures."

1182
01:41:20,031 --> 01:41:22,240
But over here, it's a...

1183
01:41:23,868 --> 01:41:25,535
A big...

1184
01:41:26,787 --> 01:41:28,455
A big mystery.

1185
01:41:29,498 --> 01:41:32,209
So I guess I've changed some.

1186
01:41:34,921 --> 01:41:38,089
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much

1187
01:41:38,174 --> 01:41:42,719
my wife is even going to recognise me
whenever it is I get back to her.

1188
01:41:44,263 --> 01:41:46,806
And how I'll ever be able to...

1189
01:41:49,352 --> 01:41:51,978
To tell her about days like today.

1190
01:41:55,233 --> 01:41:56,608
Ryan...

1191
01:41:57,693 --> 01:42:00,862
I don't know anything about Ryan.
I don't care.

1192
01:42:01,530 --> 01:42:05,200
The man means nothing to me,
it's just a name. But if...

1193
01:42:07,036 --> 01:42:09,537
You know, if going to Ramelle

1194
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:11,206
and finding him, so he can go home,

1195
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:12,916
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife

1196
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,295
well, then... Then that's my mission.

1197
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:20,924
You want to leave?

1198
01:42:21,008 --> 01:42:24,052
You want to go off and fight the war?

1199
01:42:26,931 --> 01:42:28,390
All right.

1200
01:42:29,725 --> 01:42:32,269
All right, I won't stop you.

1201
01:42:32,353 --> 01:42:34,938
I'll even put in the paperwork.

1202
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:41,278
I just know that every man I kill,
the farther away from home I feel.

1203
01:44:06,489 --> 01:44:08,073
By memories

1204
01:44:09,408 --> 01:44:11,451
Of the days gone by

1205
01:44:13,287 --> 01:44:15,080
In my solitude

1206
01:44:15,998 --> 01:44:18,458
You taunt me

1207
01:44:18,542 --> 01:44:22,087
With memories that never die

1208
01:44:23,297 --> 01:44:25,757
I sit in my chair

1209
01:44:25,841 --> 01:44:28,051
Filled with despair

1210
01:44:28,135 --> 01:44:29,969
There's no one

1211
01:44:30,054 --> 01:44:32,472
Could be so sad

1212
01:44:33,349 --> 01:44:35,392
With gloom everywhere

1213
01:44:35,476 --> 01:44:38,103
I sit and I stare...

1214
01:44:51,992 --> 01:44:54,077
Halftrack! Cover!

1215
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:13,304
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

1216
01:45:34,201 --> 01:45:36,578
Get ready to move on their left flank!
Take their left flank!

1217
01:45:36,662 --> 01:45:39,539
Hold on and make sure they're down!

1218
01:46:00,686 --> 01:46:03,313
101 st! We're coming out!

1219
01:46:10,738 --> 01:46:13,698
That was a recon element, 2nd SS.

1220
01:46:15,034 --> 01:46:18,620
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1221
01:46:20,498 --> 01:46:23,917
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1222
01:46:24,001 --> 01:46:26,085
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501 st.

1223
01:46:26,170 --> 01:46:27,670
Ryan. First of the 506th.

1224
01:46:27,755 --> 01:46:30,131
PFC Toynbe, Third of the 506th.

1225
01:46:30,216 --> 01:46:32,175
James Francis Ryan?

1226
01:46:32,259 --> 01:46:34,761
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1227
01:46:46,524 --> 01:46:49,484
Looks like you guys got hit pretty hard.

1228
01:46:49,568 --> 01:46:53,112
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

1229
01:46:55,533 --> 01:46:59,118
They came in,
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

1230
01:47:05,334 --> 01:47:08,878
Tell you what, sir, if you're our relief,
I'm gonna file a complaint.

1231
01:47:08,963 --> 01:47:10,922
I wouldn't blame you.

1232
01:47:11,674 --> 01:47:13,424
Who's your CO?

1233
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:17,804
It would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1234
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:22,350
I'm afraid the best we can muster up
right now is a corporal.

1235
01:47:22,434 --> 01:47:24,978
So, what are you guys all about?

1236
01:47:25,563 --> 01:47:28,064
We're here for him. Ryan.

1237
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,858
Me, sir?

1238
01:47:40,202 --> 01:47:42,579
James Francis Ryan of Iowa?

1239
01:47:43,414 --> 01:47:46,874
Yes, sir.
Payton, Iowa, that's correct, but...

1240
01:47:46,959 --> 01:47:48,960
What is this about?

1241
01:47:50,796 --> 01:47:53,590
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1242
01:48:00,389 --> 01:48:02,015
Which ones?

1243
01:48:04,935 --> 01:48:06,436
All of them.

1244
01:48:16,322 --> 01:48:17,905
On the level?

1245
01:48:19,325 --> 01:48:21,284
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

1246
01:48:24,038 --> 01:48:25,997
You might want to take
some time with this.

1247
01:48:26,081 --> 01:48:29,125
If there's someplace
you want to go and...

1248
01:48:38,135 --> 01:48:41,054
-What's this all about?
-Ryan lost his brothers.

1249
01:48:41,138 --> 01:48:43,514
-Which one?
-All of them.

1250
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:49,854
You...

1251
01:48:52,483 --> 01:48:55,777
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1252
01:48:57,488 --> 01:48:59,656
Well, you're going home.

1253
01:49:01,158 --> 01:49:03,743
Our orders are to bring you back.

1254
01:49:07,039 --> 01:49:08,665
Bring me back?

1255
01:49:11,043 --> 01:49:14,545
Corporal Henderson, I don't mean
to leave you even more shorthanded,

1256
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:15,963
but orders are orders.

1257
01:49:16,048 --> 01:49:18,883
Any communication about when
you're going to be relieved up here?

1258
01:49:19,009 --> 01:49:20,218
Sir, there's no way to tell. I mean,

1259
01:49:20,344 --> 01:49:21,886
we have no idea
what's happening south of us.

1260
01:49:21,970 --> 01:49:23,304
I have my orders, too, sir.

1261
01:49:23,389 --> 01:49:25,306
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

1262
01:49:25,391 --> 01:49:28,309
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1263
01:49:28,394 --> 01:49:30,728
I don't see that it does, sir.

1264
01:49:32,356 --> 01:49:35,400
The Chief of Staff
for the United States Army says it does.

1265
01:49:35,484 --> 01:49:38,319
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1266
01:49:38,404 --> 01:49:40,905
Now, our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1267
01:49:41,031 --> 01:49:42,990
across the Merderet
with the exception of two.

1268
01:49:43,075 --> 01:49:44,659
One at Valognes and this one here.

1269
01:49:44,743 --> 01:49:45,993
We let the Germans take them,

1270
01:49:46,078 --> 01:49:47,662
we're gonna lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1271
01:49:47,746 --> 01:49:51,249
Private, your outfit wants to stay,
that's one thing.

1272
01:49:51,333 --> 01:49:52,417
But your party's over here.

1273
01:49:52,501 --> 01:49:54,669
Sir, I can't leave
until at least reinforcements...

1274
01:49:54,753 --> 01:49:57,171
You got three minutes
to gather your gear.

1275
01:49:57,256 --> 01:49:59,340
Sir, what about them?
I mean, there's barely hardly enough...

1276
01:49:59,425 --> 01:50:00,925
Hey, asshole!

1277
01:50:01,677 --> 01:50:05,555
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1278
01:50:10,602 --> 01:50:13,271
-Sir?
-That's right.

1279
01:50:23,157 --> 01:50:27,660
-What were their names?
-Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1280
01:50:29,621 --> 01:50:31,164
Wade and...

1281
01:50:32,666 --> 01:50:34,125
Caparzo.

1282
01:50:46,513 --> 01:50:48,931
It doesn't make any sense.

1283
01:50:51,018 --> 01:50:55,271
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Why? Why do I deserve to go?

1284
01:50:55,355 --> 01:50:59,525
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard as me!

1285
01:51:03,155 --> 01:51:06,240
Is that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1286
01:51:06,325 --> 01:51:09,660
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1287
01:51:16,877 --> 01:51:19,295
Tell her that when you found me,

1288
01:51:19,379 --> 01:51:23,049
I was here and I was
with the only brothers that I have left,

1289
01:51:23,175 --> 01:51:26,385
and that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1290
01:51:27,554 --> 01:51:29,722
I think she'll understand that.

1291
01:51:29,848 --> 01:51:32,809
There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1292
01:52:15,811 --> 01:52:17,895
What are your orders?

1293
01:52:19,731 --> 01:52:23,067
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1294
01:52:24,069 --> 01:52:26,654
The world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

1295
01:52:26,738 --> 01:52:29,574
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1296
01:52:30,242 --> 01:52:33,244
I don't know. What do you think?

1297
01:52:34,288 --> 01:52:37,081
You don't want to know what I think.

1298
01:52:38,959 --> 01:52:40,626
No, Mike, I do.

1299
01:52:42,337 --> 01:52:45,631
Well, part of me thinks the kid's right.

1300
01:52:45,757 --> 01:52:48,259
What's he done to deserve this?

1301
01:52:48,343 --> 01:52:52,305
He wants to stay here, fine,
let's leave him and go home.

1302
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:54,849
Yeah.

1303
01:52:55,434 --> 01:53:00,521
But another part of me thinks
what if, by some miracle, we stay

1304
01:53:00,606 --> 01:53:03,274
and actually make it out of here?

1305
01:53:04,151 --> 01:53:07,778
Someday we might look back on this
and decide that

1306
01:53:07,863 --> 01:53:11,282
saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1307
01:53:11,366 --> 01:53:14,285
we were able to pull out of this whole

1308
01:53:14,369 --> 01:53:16,495
God-awful, shitty mess.

1309
01:53:18,165 --> 01:53:20,666
That's what I was thinking, sir.

1310
01:53:21,835 --> 01:53:24,003
Like you said, Captain,

1311
01:53:25,797 --> 01:53:27,506
we do that,

1312
01:53:27,966 --> 01:53:30,801
we all earn the right to go home.

1313
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:35,181
Oh, brother.

1314
01:53:38,644 --> 01:53:40,978
This is everything.

1315
01:53:41,688 --> 01:53:47,318
You got the two 30-calibre machine
guns, 1 7 grenades, 1 1 Hawkins mines.

1316
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:51,405
You got the two bazookas,
but they only got eight rounds left,

1317
01:53:51,490 --> 01:53:53,699
and assorted small arms.

1318
01:53:53,825 --> 01:53:57,286
We had a 60 mortar
but an arty round took it out.

1319
01:53:57,371 --> 01:54:00,039
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1320
01:54:00,165 --> 01:54:03,376
-Which they're sure to do.
-What are you thinking, sir?

1321
01:54:03,502 --> 01:54:08,089
Well, I'm thinking they're going to try
to whip around the flanks.

1322
01:54:12,678 --> 01:54:14,929
Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1323
01:54:15,013 --> 01:54:16,138
in between these buildings

1324
01:54:16,223 --> 01:54:20,184
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1325
01:54:20,268 --> 01:54:22,311
-Disable 'em?
-If we can.

1326
01:54:22,396 --> 01:54:23,980
Make that tank a 60-ton roadblock.

1327
01:54:24,064 --> 01:54:25,898
We do that, we got
a fighting chance at their flanks.

1328
01:54:26,024 --> 01:54:28,401
Yes, sir that's good. Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

1329
01:54:28,527 --> 01:54:31,445
Hit them hard as we can, one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

1330
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:33,739
Machine gun on the move down here,
and number two up high somewhere

1331
01:54:33,865 --> 01:54:35,866
to piss a little bad news down
on their heads.

1332
01:54:35,951 --> 01:54:38,202
That would be the idea.

1333
01:54:38,745 --> 01:54:40,204
Jackson.

1334
01:54:40,872 --> 01:54:43,124
If we can, I'd like to get you up
in that bell tower.

1335
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:46,252
-Yes, sir.
-Give you a little company if you need it.

1336
01:54:46,378 --> 01:54:48,379
Yes, sir. Some company couldn't hurt.

1337
01:54:48,463 --> 01:54:52,508
I'd say a .30 with about
1 ,000 rounds would be okay.

1338
01:54:52,592 --> 01:54:54,635
Parker, job opportunity.

1339
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,721
Yeah. Well, it's not the worst idea
ever, Captain.

1340
01:54:56,805 --> 01:54:58,389
It's just that everything depends
on getting the tank

1341
01:54:58,473 --> 01:55:00,558
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1342
01:55:00,726 --> 01:55:03,728
So how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

1343
01:55:04,229 --> 01:55:07,148
Reiben's right. As our esteemed
colleague from the Airborne pointed out,

1344
01:55:07,232 --> 01:55:09,525
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1345
01:55:09,609 --> 01:55:13,446
so how do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

1346
01:55:13,572 --> 01:55:15,948
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1347
01:55:16,074 --> 01:55:19,201
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1348
01:55:19,286 --> 01:55:21,412
Yeah, but with what?

1349
01:55:23,081 --> 01:55:26,917
-Well, we could try a sticky bomb.
-Sticky bomb, sir?

1350
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:31,964
-Sir, are you making that up?
-No. It's in the field manual.

1351
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,924
You check it out if you want to.

1352
01:55:34,009 --> 01:55:36,093
We seem to be out of field manuals, sir.

1353
01:55:36,178 --> 01:55:38,095
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1354
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:39,638
All right, you have
some demolition, don't you?

1355
01:55:39,765 --> 01:55:41,682
Some TNT or some composition B?

1356
01:55:41,767 --> 01:55:43,476
Yeah, that, sir, is the one thing
we got plenty of.

1357
01:55:43,602 --> 01:55:46,228
I got that bridge wired with enough
composition B to blow it twice.

1358
01:55:46,313 --> 01:55:48,314
All right. You can spare some, then.

1359
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:51,650
You take a standard-issue GI sock,

1360
01:55:51,777 --> 01:55:54,862
cram it with as much
comp B as it can hold,

1361
01:55:54,946 --> 01:55:57,406
rig up a simple fuse,

1362
01:55:57,491 --> 01:56:00,034
then you coat the whole thing
with axle grease.

1363
01:56:00,118 --> 01:56:04,622
That way, when you throw it,
it should stick. It's a bomb that sticks.

1364
01:56:04,706 --> 01:56:06,332
It's a sticky bomb.

1365
01:56:06,458 --> 01:56:08,834
You come up with a better way
to knock the tracks off a tank,

1366
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,544
I'm all ears.

1367
01:56:10,629 --> 01:56:14,173
This is good.
Now we got to surrender our socks.

1368
01:56:28,647 --> 01:56:30,147
Haul away.

1369
01:56:44,162 --> 01:56:48,082
All right, select the field of fire.
Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1370
01:56:48,166 --> 01:56:51,502
All right, I can cover
1 2 to nine from here.

1371
01:56:54,714 --> 01:56:56,841
-Easy!
-I got her!

1372
01:57:31,209 --> 01:57:33,043
Here are the mines.

1373
01:57:43,972 --> 01:57:46,390
For being the best we can do,

1374
01:57:46,474 --> 01:57:50,477
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

1375
01:57:53,148 --> 01:57:55,649
And this position right here,

1376
01:57:57,736 --> 01:57:59,320
this is the Alamo.

1377
01:57:59,905 --> 01:58:03,574
They push us back this far,
last man alive blows the bridge.

1378
01:58:03,658 --> 01:58:05,701
We only got a 30-second delay
on that fuse,

1379
01:58:05,785 --> 01:58:07,828
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man

1380
01:58:07,913 --> 01:58:11,999
you better hurry your ass off,
or you're not going to be alive long.

1381
01:58:12,083 --> 01:58:15,502
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1382
01:58:16,421 --> 01:58:18,380
Never more than
two feet away from me,

1383
01:58:18,465 --> 01:58:20,674
and that's not negotiable.

1384
01:58:21,801 --> 01:58:24,261
I'll get some ammo. Come on.

1385
01:58:27,265 --> 01:58:28,557
-Hey, Upham.
-Yes.

1386
01:58:28,642 --> 01:58:30,517
-Listen to me, all right?
-Yeah.

1387
01:58:30,602 --> 01:58:32,144
-You're listening?
-Yes.

1388
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:34,313
All right, we're gonna be displacing

1389
01:58:34,439 --> 01:58:36,023
and falling back like crazy
sons of bitches.

1390
01:58:36,107 --> 01:58:37,191
Right up there.

1391
01:58:37,275 --> 01:58:40,736
So you got to be Johnny on the spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

1392
01:58:40,820 --> 01:58:42,529
-Right.
-You understand that?

1393
01:58:42,614 --> 01:58:44,907
-Johnny on the spot.
-Yeah.

1394
01:58:44,991 --> 01:58:48,118
-You all right?
-Yeah. Yes.

1395
01:58:48,453 --> 01:58:49,703
You know, when we were
shipping out of England

1396
01:58:49,788 --> 01:58:51,747
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes,

1397
01:58:51,831 --> 01:58:54,959
and I said "No, thank you,
I don't smoke."

1398
01:58:55,961 --> 01:58:57,544
"I don't smoke."

1399
01:58:59,381 --> 01:59:02,341
-Quite a situation, huh?
-Unbelievable.

1400
01:59:03,677 --> 01:59:09,223
Here. Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

1401
01:59:09,683 --> 01:59:11,558
You got that right.

1402
01:59:13,812 --> 01:59:15,187
FUBAR.

1403
01:59:17,524 --> 01:59:18,565
Ouch.

1404
01:59:18,858 --> 01:59:20,484
-Yeah, well...
-FUBAR.

1405
01:59:20,568 --> 01:59:23,070
It's going to be a real show, huh?

1406
01:59:23,154 --> 01:59:25,072
Yeah. Okay.

1407
01:59:31,329 --> 01:59:32,997
Take it easy.

1408
01:59:34,165 --> 01:59:35,624
FUBAR.

1409
02:00:13,538 --> 02:00:17,875
-Who's that singing, sir?
-Edith Piaf.

1410
02:00:20,295 --> 02:00:22,838
What's she so upset about?

1411
02:00:23,673 --> 02:00:25,215
Her lover left her,

1412
02:00:25,342 --> 02:00:28,802
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1413
02:00:29,971 --> 02:00:31,889
That would do it.

1414
02:01:01,169 --> 02:01:04,129
"Even life itself only represents you.

1415
02:01:07,258 --> 02:01:09,843
"Sometimes I dream
that I'm in your arms."

1416
02:01:09,928 --> 02:01:12,346
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1417
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:14,807
-The chorus. It's the chorus.
-The chorus.

1418
02:01:15,558 --> 02:01:18,185
"And you speak softly in my ear

1419
02:01:20,063 --> 02:01:22,481
"and you say things

1420
02:01:22,565 --> 02:01:24,983
"that make my eyes close.

1421
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:29,405
"And I find that marvellous."

1422
02:01:29,489 --> 02:01:32,116
-Again, Upham...
-Yes.

1423
02:01:32,826 --> 02:01:37,454
...to be honest with you,
I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1424
02:01:38,331 --> 02:01:41,834
-Marvellous.
-No, it's really a melancholy song.

1425
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:45,629
At the beginning of the song, she says,
"And then one day, you left.

1426
02:01:45,755 --> 02:01:49,758
"You left me, and I've been
desperate ever since.

1427
02:01:49,843 --> 02:01:53,011
"I see you all over the sky,
I see you all over the Earth."

1428
02:01:53,138 --> 02:01:54,763
Jesus, Upham,
any more songs like this,

1429
02:01:54,848 --> 02:01:56,557
the krauts aren't going
to have to shoot me.

1430
02:01:56,641 --> 02:01:59,476
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1431
02:01:59,602 --> 02:02:02,271
You know,
you're a strange bird, Upham.

1432
02:02:02,355 --> 02:02:04,231
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1433
02:02:04,315 --> 02:02:06,316
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1434
02:02:06,443 --> 02:02:09,111
It reminds me of Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
and what she said to me

1435
02:02:09,195 --> 02:02:10,696
the day I left for basic.

1436
02:02:10,822 --> 02:02:13,323
What, "Don't touch me"?

1437
02:02:13,450 --> 02:02:15,993
No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1438
02:02:16,119 --> 02:02:18,912
She comes into my mom's shop
to try on a few things, all right?

1439
02:02:18,997 --> 02:02:22,791
And she's easily, like, a 44 double E.

1440
02:02:22,876 --> 02:02:24,501
-Double E?
-These things are massive.

1441
02:02:24,627 --> 02:02:25,836
Those are big.

1442
02:02:25,962 --> 02:02:29,298
No. And I've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42 D, all right?

1443
02:02:29,382 --> 02:02:31,091
So we're in the dressing room,
she's trying to squeeze

1444
02:02:31,176 --> 02:02:34,678
into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle

1445
02:02:34,804 --> 02:02:36,972
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1446
02:02:37,056 --> 02:02:39,641
And it's beautiful 'cause she's just
pouring out of this thing, you know?

1447
02:02:39,726 --> 02:02:41,477
-Is it really tight?
-No, no. It's beautiful.

1448
02:02:41,561 --> 02:02:43,020
And she sees me, and she can tell

1449
02:02:43,146 --> 02:02:45,731
I got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty, all right?

1450
02:02:45,857 --> 02:02:47,858
And she says to me,
"Richard, calm down."

1451
02:02:47,984 --> 02:02:50,444
And she says, "When you're over there,

1452
02:02:50,528 --> 02:02:52,404
"if you see anything that upsets you,

1453
02:02:52,530 --> 02:02:55,574
"or if you're ever scared,
I want you to close your eyes

1454
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:58,702
"and think of these. You understand?"

1455
02:03:00,205 --> 02:03:02,331
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1456
02:03:15,512 --> 02:03:17,554
Are you all right, sir?

1457
02:03:18,556 --> 02:03:21,350
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1458
02:03:26,231 --> 02:03:29,191
Is it true you were
a teacher back home?

1459
02:03:30,235 --> 02:03:31,693
Yes.

1460
02:03:31,778 --> 02:03:34,112
See, that's something I could never do,
you know.

1461
02:03:34,239 --> 02:03:38,700
Not after the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers. No, sir.

1462
02:03:41,037 --> 02:03:43,455
I had 1 ,000 kids like you.

1463
02:03:49,712 --> 02:03:52,422
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1464
02:03:53,758 --> 02:03:56,426
I've been trying,
and I can't see their faces at all.

1465
02:03:56,553 --> 02:03:58,720
Has that ever happened to you?

1466
02:03:58,805 --> 02:04:01,223
You gotta think of a context.

1467
02:04:03,434 --> 02:04:05,519
What does that mean?

1468
02:04:05,603 --> 02:04:07,145
Well, you don't just think
about their faces.

1469
02:04:07,272 --> 02:04:11,900
You think about something specific,
something you've done together.

1470
02:04:15,613 --> 02:04:18,574
Well, when I think of home,
I think of something specific.

1471
02:04:18,658 --> 02:04:21,785
I think of my hammock in the backyard,

1472
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:26,957
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1473
02:04:31,254 --> 02:04:34,548
This one night, two of my brothers came

1474
02:04:34,632 --> 02:04:37,634
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1475
02:04:38,469 --> 02:04:41,513
and they said
they had a surprise for me.

1476
02:04:42,098 --> 02:04:45,225
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft,

1477
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:48,312
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1478
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:52,482
with Alice. Alice Jardine.

1479
02:04:55,486 --> 02:04:59,656
I mean, picture a girl who just took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1480
02:04:59,782 --> 02:05:02,367
and hit every branch coming down.

1481
02:05:04,329 --> 02:05:06,955
And Dan's got her shirt off.

1482
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:09,833
So he's working on this bra
and he's trying to get it off

1483
02:05:09,959 --> 02:05:13,170
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out,

1484
02:05:14,005 --> 02:05:17,341
"Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!"

1485
02:05:20,011 --> 02:05:23,513
And so Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams, and she jumps up,

1486
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:25,265
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

1487
02:05:25,350 --> 02:05:26,558
but she's still got this shirt
over her head.

1488
02:05:26,684 --> 02:05:30,854
She goes running right into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1489
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:35,150
So now Dan is just so mad at us,
he starts coming after us,

1490
02:05:35,234 --> 02:05:37,611
but at the same time,
Alice is over there unconscious.

1491
02:05:37,695 --> 02:05:39,196
He's got to wake her up.

1492
02:05:39,322 --> 02:05:42,574
So he grabs her by a leg
and he's dragging her.

1493
02:05:42,700 --> 02:05:45,869
At the same time, he picks up a shovel
and he's going after Sean.

1494
02:05:45,995 --> 02:05:48,121
And Sean said,
"What are you trying to hit me for?

1495
02:05:48,206 --> 02:05:50,332
"I just did you a favour."

1496
02:05:52,168 --> 02:05:54,044
And so this makes Dan more angry.

1497
02:05:54,170 --> 02:05:57,089
He tries to swing this thing.
He loses the shovel.

1498
02:05:57,215 --> 02:05:59,883
It goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1499
02:06:00,009 --> 02:06:02,594
The thing explodes,
the whole barn almost goes up

1500
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:04,888
because of this thing.

1501
02:06:19,737 --> 02:06:21,613
That was it. That was the last...
That was...

1502
02:06:21,739 --> 02:06:23,281
Dan went off to basic next day.

1503
02:06:23,408 --> 02:06:26,993
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1504
02:06:27,078 --> 02:06:29,204
That was two years ago.

1505
02:06:31,082 --> 02:06:32,457
Oh, my.

1506
02:06:34,419 --> 02:06:37,963
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1507
02:06:39,215 --> 02:06:40,590
No.

1508
02:06:41,759 --> 02:06:44,469
No. That one I save just for me.

1509
02:07:49,786 --> 02:07:51,661
Enemy from the east.

1510
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:55,749
He sees Tiger tanks, two of them.

1511
02:07:55,833 --> 02:07:57,834
Panzer tanks, two of them.

1512
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,753
Infantry.

1513
02:07:59,837 --> 02:08:01,713
Fifty plus change.

1514
02:08:10,681 --> 02:08:12,432
Disperse! You know what to do!

1515
02:08:12,517 --> 02:08:14,059
-Reiben, get on the rabbit.
-Yes, sir.

1516
02:08:14,185 --> 02:08:17,521
-Upham, get some cover.
-Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1517
02:08:17,647 --> 02:08:20,565
-This is it.
-Everybody check your ammo!

1518
02:08:21,234 --> 02:08:22,526
Good luck, Reiben.

1519
02:08:22,652 --> 02:08:25,987
I don't need any luck, Sarge,
I was born lucky.

1520
02:08:38,751 --> 02:08:40,043
One in five tracer?

1521
02:08:40,127 --> 02:08:42,128
Yep, and tracers point both ways.

1522
02:08:42,213 --> 02:08:46,258
Yeah? Why don't you check
the head space and she should run.

1523
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:56,309
Upham! Hustle up!

1524
02:09:46,652 --> 02:09:48,320
-Corporal Upham?
-Yes, sir.

1525
02:09:48,446 --> 02:09:50,697
We don't have a 30-calibre
machine gun in this position.

1526
02:09:50,781 --> 02:09:54,159
Either Mr Mellish or Mr Jackson
in the bell tower needs that.

1527
02:09:54,285 --> 02:09:55,619
Yes, sir.

1528
02:09:56,454 --> 02:09:59,706
Upham! Jackson's fine.
Turn around to Mellish.

1529
02:10:21,145 --> 02:10:26,107
There's a ton of infantry, Captain.
I don't know if they took the bait though.

1530
02:10:48,881 --> 02:10:51,007
You got any more of that?

1531
02:11:37,179 --> 02:11:39,514
Panzers didn't take the bait.

1532
02:11:44,437 --> 02:11:47,272
Infantry's moving to the left.

1533
02:11:47,356 --> 02:11:50,734
Halftrack just went by
with about 20 troops, sir.

1534
02:13:29,416 --> 02:13:32,752
Mellish! Henderson! Displace!

1535
02:13:54,316 --> 02:13:56,109
Do it, now! Light it up!

1536
02:13:56,193 --> 02:13:57,986
You! Light it!

1537
02:14:09,165 --> 02:14:11,291
Thirty infantry on the right flank!

1538
02:14:11,375 --> 02:14:13,877
Get over there,
find a hole, and stop them!

1539
02:14:13,961 --> 02:14:15,628
Displace!

1540
02:14:27,224 --> 02:14:28,516
Upham!

1541
02:14:43,908 --> 02:14:45,366
Clear!

1542
02:14:47,161 --> 02:14:48,411
Krauts!

1543
02:14:50,414 --> 02:14:51,915
Right flank!

1544
02:15:28,369 --> 02:15:30,536
Get down! Get down!

1545
02:15:37,586 --> 02:15:40,713
Upham! Upham! 30-cal! Hurry!

1546
02:15:40,798 --> 02:15:44,300
And find the captain!
This flank's going to fold!

1547
02:16:39,189 --> 02:16:41,983
Reversing! He's still in this fight!

1548
02:16:42,985 --> 02:16:45,528
No, no, Ryan, get down! Get down!

1549
02:16:58,459 --> 02:17:20,313
Ryan!

1550
02:17:22,649 --> 02:17:24,233
-Ryan!
-Get off me!

1551
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:26,819
-Are you all right?
-Get off me!

1552
02:17:26,904 --> 02:17:29,072
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, too, Captain. Thanks.

1553
02:17:29,907 --> 02:17:34,577
Okay, both sides!
Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

1554
02:17:37,539 --> 02:17:39,040
Grenade!

1555
02:17:40,876 --> 02:17:42,543
20-mill!

1556
02:17:44,004 --> 02:17:46,714
Flak gun, 20 millimetre. Take it out!

1557
02:17:59,061 --> 02:18:02,605
Heavy weapon in defilade below!
I ain't got a shot!

1558
02:18:07,111 --> 02:18:08,820
Pincer move, Parker!

1559
02:18:08,946 --> 02:18:11,406
-Targets 8 o'clock low!
-Shit!

1560
02:18:11,490 --> 02:18:13,741
God grant me strength.

1561
02:18:27,631 --> 02:18:29,173
Displace!

1562
02:18:29,299 --> 02:18:30,675
Come on!

1563
02:18:46,483 --> 02:18:49,235
Cover, Upham! Cover! Cover!

1564
02:19:06,003 --> 02:19:08,004
I'm out of 30-calibre.

1565
02:19:11,383 --> 02:19:14,260
Blessed be the Lord, my strength,
which teaches my hands to war

1566
02:19:14,344 --> 02:19:16,679
and my fingers to fight.

1567
02:19:25,189 --> 02:19:27,690
My goodness and my fortress,

1568
02:19:27,774 --> 02:19:30,443
my high tower and my deliverer,

1569
02:19:33,030 --> 02:19:36,240
my shield and he in whom I trust.

1570
02:19:39,286 --> 02:19:41,370
Come here, baby.

1571
02:20:03,977 --> 02:20:05,770
Parker, get down!

1572
02:20:27,459 --> 02:20:29,877
Captain, that 20-millimetre's killing us.

1573
02:20:29,962 --> 02:20:32,255
We gotta try to flank it somehow.

1574
02:20:32,381 --> 02:20:35,258
Well, let me get over for the top shot.

1575
02:20:59,741 --> 02:21:01,158
Upham!

1576
02:21:20,012 --> 02:21:24,473
Upham! Upham!
Upham, ammo, God damn it!

1577
02:22:07,684 --> 02:22:10,102
I'm jammed! I'm jammed!
You got any 30-cal?

1578
02:22:10,187 --> 02:22:11,854
-I'm out.
-Shit.

1579
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:26,202
Upham! Upham!

1580
02:23:24,344 --> 02:23:25,803
Reiben!

1581
02:23:52,289 --> 02:23:56,459
I'm out! I need another bandoleer!
Anybody got a bandoleer?

1582
02:24:21,485 --> 02:24:23,652
God! God!

1583
02:24:27,949 --> 02:24:30,868
You stupid son of a bitch!

1584
02:25:14,538 --> 02:25:17,081
Let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop.
Listen to me! Listen to me! Stop!

1585
02:25:17,165 --> 02:25:18,916
Stop! Don't...

1586
02:25:55,954 --> 02:26:00,791
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1587
02:26:00,876 --> 02:26:02,668
Son of a bitch!

1588
02:26:04,129 --> 02:26:05,170
Bitch!

1589
02:27:24,209 --> 02:27:27,336
-I'm out.
-Those 60 rounds.

1590
02:27:28,713 --> 02:27:31,882
-We can use them without the tube.
-How?

1591
02:27:31,967 --> 02:27:34,927
Fuse-arming wire, set back, heave it!

1592
02:27:50,652 --> 02:27:52,319
Panzerschreck!

1593
02:28:26,396 --> 02:28:28,605
We're going to the Alamo.

1594
02:28:38,867 --> 02:28:40,701
Alamo! Alamo!

1595
02:29:00,263 --> 02:29:02,556
We'll take it! You fall back!

1596
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:06,268
-You be right behind us!
-Soon as we're in business!

1597
02:29:10,231 --> 02:29:12,316
Displace. Reiben.

1598
02:29:14,819 --> 02:29:16,278
Reload.

1599
02:30:05,078 --> 02:30:06,620
All right, go.

1600
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:08,956
We're blowing the bridge!

1601
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:11,959
-Get off! Clear the bridge!
-Displace...

1602
02:30:34,816 --> 02:30:37,818
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

1603
02:30:37,902 --> 02:30:40,445
-I just got the wind knocked out of me.
-Well, get out of here!

1604
02:30:40,530 --> 02:30:43,907
Take cover!
We're going to blow this bridge!

1605
02:30:45,368 --> 02:30:47,119
Come on, come on!

1606
02:30:51,916 --> 02:30:54,751
Tiger coming!
Coming across the bridge!

1607
02:31:26,826 --> 02:31:30,120
Captain, get behind something!

1608
02:31:30,205 --> 02:31:32,873
Come on, Captain, move it!

1609
02:31:55,813 --> 02:31:57,022
Mike.

1610
02:32:02,237 --> 02:32:03,570
Mike!

1611
02:32:42,568 --> 02:32:43,860
Captain.

1612
02:32:46,656 --> 02:32:50,742
Captain, where the hell are you going?
Captain, get back here!

1613
02:34:43,815 --> 02:34:45,148
Upham.

1614
02:35:16,139 --> 02:35:18,348
Hang in there, Captain.

1615
02:36:02,477 --> 02:36:04,186
Medic!

1616
02:36:06,981 --> 02:36:09,524
Medic! We got a medic?

1617
02:36:16,324 --> 02:36:19,201
They're tank-busters, sir. P-51 s.

1618
02:36:20,161 --> 02:36:22,370
Angels on our shoulders.

1619
02:36:28,336 --> 02:36:30,045
What, sir?

1620
02:36:34,509 --> 02:36:35,884
James...

1621
02:36:37,678 --> 02:36:39,179
Earn this.

1622
02:36:43,434 --> 02:36:44,893
Earn it.

1623
02:37:14,340 --> 02:37:16,508
"My dear Mrs Ryan,

They wanted to come with me.

To be honest with you,

1657

I wasn't sure how I'd feel
coming back here.

Every day I think about

I hope that was enough.
