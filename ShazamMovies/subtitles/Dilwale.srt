You are correct.

We do not bring your son back.

539
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:41,266
The reason also ..

540
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:43,266
We're building a new home.

541
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:46,566

543
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:52,666

..kerana Perbalahan and this hostility,

549
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:08,666
We can not bring Veer
stay with us.

550
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:11,966
Because this will endanger the life of him.

551
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,366
And she was a child.

552
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:16,966

- Dad does not know where the boy's face all kinds ni.
- Not the father.

554
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:21,466

555
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,766
Sometimes father flavor ..

556
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:27,566
Father does not do justice to you.

557

But at that time you dah go away.

01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:01,393
You betrayed my trust dah Kaali.

1044
01:23:02,343 --> 01:23:05,193
Today because Ishita,
I would forget about it and let you get away.

1045
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:06,293
But if you come again,

1046
01:23:06,293 --> 01:23:08,593
I will kill you.

1047
01:23:15,193 --> 01:23:17,193

But what kind of father are you?
Uncle so he knew ..

1050
01:23:24,593 --> 01:23:27,593
He will not have the blessing of your relationship.

1051
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:31,243
I will try Pujuk him.

1052
01:23:42,493 --> 01:23:46,893
All right! Dah dad willing to meet them both.

1053
01:23:48,343 --> 01:23:50,593
Thank you, father.

1054
01:23:50,593 --> 01:23:55,893
Other objects is not the story of my father,
but the father could not look you sad.

1055
01:23:59,593 --> 01:24:00,693
Mr. Malik!

1056
01:24:00,893 --> 01:24:05,693
What master do?
Mr. nak enter the master's son to the enemy?

1057
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:07,793
You do not understand Raghav.

1058
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:10,793
For a Meera, I will make just about anything.

1059
01:24:11,693 --> 01:24:14,793
But I can not see the defeat itself.

1060
01:24:14,893 --> 01:24:19,793
It seems that now we are in contact with Finish this hostility.

1061
01:24:37,543 --> 01:24:40,793
Always we hear and see,
friendship ..

1062
01:24:40,793 --> 01:24:43,293
..berubah Into family relationships.

1063
01:24:43,893 --> 01:24:46,893
But Malik, who is probably the first time we hear
,

1064
01:24:46,893 --> 01:24:50,893
Hostility so long,
exchange into a family.

1065
01:24:50,893 --> 01:24:54,493
There is only one way
Finish son Randhir hostility.

1066
01:24:55,493 --> 01:24:57,693
"Finish" your enemy.

1067
01:24:59,193 --> 01:25:00,193
Meera where?

1068
01:25:00,393 --> 01:25:04,593
You know Kaali?
Meera very cintakan you.

1069
01:25:04,693 --> 01:25:09,893
But perhaps he will not appear
you and your father died.

1070
01:25:56,093 --> 01:26:00,093
Meera. Kaali and father
dah toy with us.

1071
01:26:00,593 --> 01:26:02,893
They attacked us first.

1072
01:29:12,693 --> 01:29:14,693
Meera just try understand the present situation.

1073
01:29:14,993 --> 01:29:19,193
By what applies to Randhir Bakshi,
they all will not sit still.

1074
01:29:19,293 --> 01:29:21,793
If not yourself, please fikirkan
Ishita article.

1075
01:29:21,793 --> 01:29:25,843
If he knew about this case,
what will be on him later.

1076
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:29,893
I dah assume you kind my brother.
Listen to my advice.

1077
01:29:30,693 --> 01:29:32,893
Take Ishita and go away from here.

1078
01:29:32,893 --> 01:29:35,493
And mulakan new life.

1079
01:29:35,693 --> 01:29:38,693
We will was always on your side
like a shadow.

1080
01:29:40,593 --> 01:29:44,193
Meera dah go away from here.

1081
01:29:46,593 --> 01:29:49,093
No one knows
where he is going.

1082
01:29:50,493 --> 01:29:53,493
But I need to see him ..

1083
01:29:53,493 --> 01:29:56,093
It's important for him to know what exactly happened
.

1084
01:29:56,293 --> 01:29:59,293
Kaali. I am not a wise

1085
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:02,793
But one case I studied
off this bloodshed,

1086
01:30:02,893 --> 01:30:05,193
This life only once.

1087
01:30:05,293 --> 01:30:07,193
Well you forget everything.

1088
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:09,393
And fikirlah about yourself Veer.

1089
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:13,693
We are always together right.
We are both beginning a new life.

1090
01:30:40,693 --> 01:30:42,793
Believe it or not,

1091
01:30:42,793 --> 01:30:45,793
But the prevailing story 15 years ago,

1092
01:30:45,893 --> 01:30:48,393
Now repeated.

1093
01:30:49,893 --> 01:30:53,093
Far  wherever we try to run,
met also our back.

1094
01:30:53,293 --> 01:30:57,793
True Raj, punyalah many other countries besides India and Bulgaria
..

1095
01:30:57,793 --> 01:31:00,793
Who knows, here too they live.

1096
01:31:01,993 --> 01:31:05,493
For a long time I tried to hide everything than Veer.

1097
01:31:06,993 --> 01:31:09,493
Veer nak  I do not know the truth until
when-when.

1098
01:31:10,093 --> 01:31:12,493
Whatever we try to stop contact with Veer.

1099
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:15,693
Lagipun Meera ..

1100
01:31:17,293 --> 01:31:18,893
Takkan blessing of their relationship.

1101
01:31:18,993 --> 01:31:22,543
But this is about my life kak.
What is the problem?

1102
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:26,393
The problem is too big.
Sister no longer talk about ni nak.

1103
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:27,193
Forget him.

1104
01:31:27,393 --> 01:31:28,293
But why?

1105
01:31:28,293 --> 01:31:32,493
What is so between brother and sister Ishita?
Until he does not agree?

1106
01:31:32,693 --> 01:31:34,893
Kan brother dah conversation, do not ask any questions.

Just look at eh Sid.
Abang and Meera should know each other.

1112
01:31:52,343 --> 01:31:55,193
If you do not, why they do not agree?

1113
01:31:55,193 --> 01:31:57,593
- Who knows the story of your brother last?

Apologize Raj.

Where knew Ramlal and liquid
Pogo hearts and change minds.

1248
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:20,315
They are not allowed to liquid-liquid aiskrim.

1249
01:38:21,325 --> 01:38:23,493
Nice work, you kahwin run.

Because they still save more memories ..

1373
01:45:33,757 --> 01:45:36,693
But my obvious state of my brother ..

Even with what dah so,

1375

But the far corner of the heart...

1376

He may not be able to forget his first love.

1377
01:45:49,693 --> 01:45:52,493
Hantarkan this train Veer.

1689
02:06:54,027 --> 02:06:56,127
Sorry Ishita.

1695
02:07:25,877 --> 02:07:29,027
Your father quotes him on the street.

1696
02:07:29,277 --> 02:07:31,277
Ishita...

1697

02:07:33,377 --> 02:07:35,027

1708
02:08:38,627 --> 02:08:41,427
There's nothing to hide brother.

1709
02:08:41,627 --> 02:08:46,127
Abang not my biological brother, right?

1710

Who told you?

1711
02:08:54,077 --> 02:08:56,127
Sister Ishita.

1712
02:08:59,427 --> 02:09:01,227
Why silent brother?

1713
02:09:01,227 --> 02:09:02,577

Sister Ishita layout requirements before kahwin son.

1722
02:09:42,427 --> 02:09:45,427
In order for me to leave my brother.

02:09:53,509 --> 02:09:55,427
What do you say?

1724
02:09:55,433 --> 02:09:57,077
I leave him.

1725
02:09:57,227 --> 02:10:00,227
I left Ishita. Leave...

1726
02:10:02,527 --> 02:10:04,527
Brother, I'll meet someone else.

1727
02:10:04,627 --> 02:10:06,127
But I would first check ..

Make sure you check out.

1730
02:10:18,227 --> 02:10:23,227
Perhaps there is a problem with the brother sister
all the pretty girls.

1731
