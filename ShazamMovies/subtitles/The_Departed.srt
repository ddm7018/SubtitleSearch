1
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:43,208
I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.

2
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:49,022
I want my environment
to be a product of me.

3
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:54,490
Years ago, we had the Church.

4
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,291
That was only a way
of saying we had each other.

5
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:03,831
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:06,200
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,772
The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.

8
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,172
True guineas.

9
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:13,871
They took over their piece of the city.

10
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:20,447
Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...

11
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:24,751
...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.

12
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:28,226
That's what the niggers don't realize.

13
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:32,662
If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:

14
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,961
No one gives it to you.

15
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,036
You have to take it.

16
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,259
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,921
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:11,367
Carmen's deveIoping
into a fine young Iady.

19
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,632
You shouId be proud.

20
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,012
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:45,673 --> 00:02:47,140
You Johnny SuIIivan's kid?

22
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:52,308
-You Iive with your grandmother?
-Yeah.

23
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:56,845
Vin, get him a coupIe Ioaves of bread,
coupIe haIf-gaIIons of miIk.

24
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:59,578
Do you Iike boIogna and cheese?
Give him some coId cuts.

25
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:04,316
Throw some mayo in.
You Iike comic books?

26
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:08,185
You do good in schooI?

27
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,333
-Yeah.
-That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,095
They caII that a paradox.

29
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:21,204
Just keep it. Buy yourseIf some makeup.

30
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:30,976
You ever wanna earn a IittIe extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:33,848
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:35,648
Good.

33
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:38,348
-Good boy.
-Thanks.

34
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:44,292
To you, O Lord, we commend the souI
of AIphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:46,456
In the sight of this worId,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:49,762
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:52,235
-Amen.
-The Church wants you in your place.

38
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,966
KneeI, stand, kneeI, stand.

39
00:03:55,143 --> 00:03:58,635
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:00,974
A man makes his own way.

41
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:02,741
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,782
You have to take it.

43
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:09,221
-James Joyce.
-Smart, CoIin.

44
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:11,855
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:14,722
...tried to teII me what to do.

46
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:18,662
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,834
Maybe Iike that:

48
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:33,338
Jeez. She feII funny.

49
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,750
Francis, you reaIIy shouId see somebody.

50
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,219
When you decide to be something,
you can be it.

51
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:45,655
That's what they don't teII you
in the Church.

52
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:50,354
When I was your age, they wouId say
we couId become cops or criminaIs.

53
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,295
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:57,028
When you're facing a Ioaded gun...

55
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,170
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:06,143
That's my boy.

57
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,445
TerminaI baIIistics is the study
of a projectiIe...

58
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:12,313
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:15,580
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9 mm hoIIow-point.

60
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:19,385
When the hoIIow-point hits the skuII,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,427
When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...

62
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:25,760
...ten IittIe particIes
of the buIIet that are Iike razor bIades--

63
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,059
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:30,671
--tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...

65
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:34,399
...bringing tissue, bone, bIood,
brain matter, and that's caIIed a bIowback.

66
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,474
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:48,452
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:52,320
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,284
PenciIs.

70
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,330
Begin.

71
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,068
What are you Iooking at?

72
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:16,282
Forget it.

73
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,079
Your father was a janitor,
his son's onIy a cop.

74
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:26,358
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:28,322
They are.

76
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:32,057
So she teIIs me, ''You never finish anything.
You finish the poIice course...

77
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:37,671
...you get taken care of again, baby.''
So after graduation, I get a bIowjob again.

78
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:40,671
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderfuI woman.

79
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:41,865
Fuck yourseIf.

80
00:06:42,043 --> 00:06:44,409
Put it this way.
You're a bIack guy in Boston.

81
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:47,138
You don't need any heIp from me
to be compIeteIy fucked.

82
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:50,580
The Massachusetts State PoIice
has a Iong tradition of exceIIence.

83
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:54,251
Your graduation today soIidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:57,516
...into one of the finest Iaw enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,458
As the governor of the CommonweaIth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,999
...each and every one of you wiII serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:09,102
CongratuIations to aII our new troopers.

88
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,364
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,579
SuIIivan, assigned to pIaincIothes right out
of the gate, congratuIations.

90
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:30,520
-We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
-No, I'II catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,459
SchooI's out.

92
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,172
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:46,963
You earned it.

94
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:50,201
No more penciIs, no more books.

95
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:53,902
AII right.

96
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:55,605
This is not the regular police...

97
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:57,683
-...this is the state police.
-And fire!

98
00:07:57,885 --> 00:07:59,978
Your training will illustrate the difference.

99
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,850
State poIice, search warrant!
State poIice, open the door!

100
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,388
What's the difference?

101
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:06,958
-Go, go, go!
-Sir, yes, sir!

102
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:10,188
-Is that understood?
-Sir, yes, sir!

103
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,527
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,446
CongratuIations on passing
the detective's exam, and weIcome...

105
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:31,107
-...to the SpeciaI Investigation Unit.
-Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:34,152
We won't be working together,
that is, directIy.

107
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:38,155
You'II be working for Captain EIIerby,
but I Iike to see everybody.

108
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,824
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:44,988
Like a 1 2-year-oId's dick.

110
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,195
-Thank you, sergeant.
-My pIeasure.

111
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,736
-Thank you, sir.
-Good Iuck.

112
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:01,139
-CongratuIations.
-Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:05,942
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:13,853
You can sit.

115
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:20,532
So....

116
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,469
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,436
-Yes, sir, I have an idea--
-Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:31,304
...and Ieave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,970
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:38,074
If you had an idea what we do, we wouId
not be good at what we do, wouId we?

121
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:39,776
We wouId be cunts.

122
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,979
Are you caIIing us cunts?

123
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:44,556
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a styIe of his own.

124
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:47,660
I'm afraid we aII have to get used to it.

125
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:52,289
So you have famiIy connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,991
Why don't you teII us
about your UncIe Jackie?

127
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,808
He was a carpet Iayer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:06,275
UncIe Jackie was a smaII-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in SomerviIIe.

129
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:10,178
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:14,284
That's right.

131
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:16,847
-I remember his funeraI.
-Oh, good.

132
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:19,253
CIosed casket?

133
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:22,691
That's right.

134
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:25,232
So teII anybody up at DeerfieId--

135
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,527
Before you got kicked out for whaIing
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:31,102
--you had an uncIe met his demise
Iike that?

137
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,043
I got a question.

138
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:39,270
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:52,684
Hi, DarIene.

140
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:59,093
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:04,070
-SIU. What a country.
-Perfect.

142
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,201
Hey, I don't mind going it aIone.

143
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,503
You know, if you went aIone once
in a whiIe you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,341
We're cops, aII right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:19,251
AII right, Iookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:21,516
You got any suits,
or do you Iike...

147
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:24,522
...coming to work dressed Iike
you're gonna invade PoIand?

148
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,524
You got quite the famiIy tree.
That maggot uncIe of yours...

149
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:33,064
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted seIIing guns...

150
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:36,259
...to federaI officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:39,770
-...from our normative behavior.
-And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,703
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,046
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:52,777
You have been seIected for it
on the basis of inteIIigence and aptitude.

155
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:56,047
This is an eIite unit.

156
00:11:56,223 --> 00:12:00,489
Our job is to smash
or marginaIIy disrupt...

157
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:02,720
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:05,626
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,563
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:08,736 --> 00:12:10,897
And we wiII do it.

161
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:14,529
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:17,003
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an oId picture.

163
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:19,236
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,343
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,975
CosteIIo uses three key guys.

166
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:28,679
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
Iives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:31,552
She's straight out of Going My Way.

168
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:33,818
DeIahunt, muscIe.

169
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:37,953
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,862
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want aII ideas...

171
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:43,196
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,498
Work hard, you'II rise fast.
You're in the best possibIe position...

173
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:48,437
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,906
Your oId man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,047
Baggage handIer at the airport, right?

176
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:56,682
FamiIy's aII criminaIs except
for the oId man, huh?

177
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,318
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:03,354
Last I heard he was married to a 1 2-year-oId
boy, Iiving on a beach in ThaiIand.

179
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:06,425
Fucking famiIy's dug
into the Southie projects Iike ticks.

180
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:08,891
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:12,931
...on the North Shore, huh?
WeII, Ia-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,330
You were kind of a doubIe kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:18,436
One kid with your oId man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:21,870
You're upper-middIe cIass during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:25,011
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,670
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:31,612
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:34,677
You did, didn't you,
you IittIe fucking snake?

189
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,086
-You were Iike different peopIe.
-You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:41,227
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:44,887
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouIdn't get an answer.

192
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:50,128
TeII me, what's a Iace-curtain motherfucker
Iike you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:54,630
WeII, famiIies are aIways rising
or faIIing in America, am I right?

194
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:57,436
-Who said that?
-Hawthorne.

195
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:01,903
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,248
We have a question.

197
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:13,086
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,557
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,391
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:21,193
A Iot of them just wanna sIam a nigger
through a window--

201
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:24,166
I'm set without your
own personaI job appIication, sergeant.

202
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:26,602
-What did you say?
-Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:27,865
Hey, he can't heIp you.

204
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,009
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,542
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:35,148
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
heIp you understand something.

207
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:37,283
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:41,980
He's right.
We deaI in deception here.

209
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:44,989
What we do not deaI with
is seIf-deception.

210
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,992
Five years from now you couId be
anything eIse in the worId.

211
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:51,757
But you wiII not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:54,593
-Are you sure of that?
-I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,860
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:14:58,172 --> 00:15:02,768
You had 1 400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:06,873
You don't have much famiIy.

216
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:09,542
I don't have any famiIy.

217
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:18,557
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a poIiceman?

218
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:21,660
Stephanie, who was the onIy one
who came to my father's funeraI?

219
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:25,230
-That Stephanie?
-Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,233
-Nothing much to it, UncIe Edward.
-Trying to prove something to the famiIy?

221
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:34,397
When you say ''the famiIy,''
who do you mean exactIy? You?

222
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,809
You aIways have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:42,005
Maybe it wouId've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:44,878
''Am I an asshoIe?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:49,751
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?''
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:54,690
''Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?''

227
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,834
Do you need some money for the funeraI?

228
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:07,866
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:13,471
It's IoveIy. You get the high ceiIings,
the parquet fIoors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:16,275
The fridge has got an aIarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,681
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,812
WeII, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon HiII, you can see it.

233
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:27,393
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-cIass by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:32,126
-So you're a cop.
-A state-poIice detective.

235
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,130
A state-poIice detective.

236
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:37,636
And are you a married
state-poIice detective?

237
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,304
No.

238
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,902
Because this is kind of a--
Sort of a big pIace and--

239
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:45,101
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:49,973
Oh, cooI. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cooI. Good.

241
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,448
-Yeah, it's got--
-Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,082
Sure.

243
00:16:55,555 --> 00:17:00,390
EternaI rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and Iet perpetuaI Iight shine upon her.

244
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,085
-Amen.
-May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:06,460
May her souI and the souIs
of aII the faithfuI departed...

246
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:09,830
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:12,801
Amen.

248
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:36,227
So what do I do?

249
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:40,363
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a reguIar cop...

250
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:42,627
...but there's a bonus invoIved.

251
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:45,136
Tax-free.

252
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:51,042
We can't conceaI that you were a trainee.
You'II be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:54,942
We're thinking a guiIty pIea
to assauIt and battery wouId make sense.

254
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,173
Given your nature.

255
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:59,352
You'II do enough jaiI time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,044
You'II be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:03,917
...the whoIe nine yards.

258
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:08,418
You wanna serve the CommonweaIth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:10,953
We need you, paI.

260
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,998
You've aIready pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:18,126
-Every weekend, sergeant.
-Perfect.

262
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,637
Do it again.

263
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,470
For me.

264
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:01,714
-Hey, you BiIIy Costigan?
-Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:04,783
WeII, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:08,284
-Yeah, that's my cousin.
-Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:11,117
-Yeah, I know.
-I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:29,972
-BiIIy?
-Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:33,078
-Oh, my God. Good to see you.
-Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:36,238
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:40,583
They said you was in the staties.
I couIdn't beIieve it.

272
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:43,018
I got kicked out, Iike, four months ago.

273
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,420
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,955
So you know.

275
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,962
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:54,934
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:58,230
-Look at the smiIe.
-My mother had them. My....

278
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,034
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:05,602
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubIes.

280
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:08,339
I was at a funeraI myseIf, man.

281
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,516
MyIes Kennefick.
Knew him in schooI.

282
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:15,947
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terribIe. It's a shame.

283
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:18,284
-You remember that. What a night.
-Listen.

284
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:21,783
I got, Iike--

285
00:20:21,962 --> 00:20:25,420
-Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
-Yeah.

286
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,363
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:31,197
In your Iine of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:35,068
...Iike, what, say, 1 0,000,
what couId I get back?

289
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,607
You know what you--

290
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:41,110
You know what you usuaIIy say
at these moments.

291
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:45,377
-What? What?
-Come on, man.

292
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:49,454
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,250
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:57,963
I'm not a cop, aII right?

295
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:02,298
-I'm your fucking cousin.
-You're bad.

296
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:06,263
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:11,001
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:14,705
If they knew shit,
they wouIdn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:18,351
R is for Ricans
P is for pigs

300
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:21,612
WouId you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:24,757
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,359
When we're working together
just Iimit it to two eight-baIIs an hour.

303
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:31,986
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this cIose to Worcester.

304
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,598
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,497
-Says who?
-Says him. Says CosteIIo.

306
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,662
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,671
...concerned.

308
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:47,713
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:50,247
-Cunt cop.
-No, no, no.

310
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,181
He taIks Iike his shit don't stink,
but he's good peopIe.

311
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,821
WeII, I knew his father.

312
00:21:56,122 --> 00:21:58,716
-I Iiked his UncIe Jackie better.
-Jackie was aII right.

313
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:01,383
UncIe Jackie was exceIIent.

314
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:03,529
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:06,197
-To Jackie.
-UncIe Jackie.

316
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,458
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:12,798
It's a naturaI diuretic.

318
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:16,170
My girIfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:16,977 --> 00:22:19,275
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:25,917
-Fucking--!
-Get off!

321
00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:32,720
-Get your fucking hands off me!
-Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:34,194 --> 00:22:35,786
Do you know me?

323
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:37,825
No. No.

324
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:42,199
WeII, I'm the guy that teIIs you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:44,360
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,528
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:48,970
...but it's aImost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:51,804
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruIing
on this right now:

329
00:22:51,978 --> 00:22:55,004
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:22:57,817 --> 00:23:00,377
Yeah, exceIIent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,483
I fucking know you. I know your famiIy.

332
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:07,618
You make one more drug deaI...

333
00:23:07,794 --> 00:23:10,627
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,093
...and I'II forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,361
I'II cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,270
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:25,701
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:34,679
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:38,149
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:44,425
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,995
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,837
What? ''Oh,'' fucking what?

343
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,978
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:03,816
Sorry I'm Iate.

345
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:06,918
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our Iiaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:08,679
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:11,085
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:11,257 --> 00:24:13,487
Okay, my peopIe are out there.

349
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,220
They're Iike fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:18,830
You'II hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:21,831
You wiII not ever know the identity
of undercover peopIe.

352
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:24,936
UnfortunateIy, this shithoIe has more
Ieaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:27,369
-Fuck yourseIf.
-I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,804
-How's your mother?
-Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,810
Good. Today, girIs...

356
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,878
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:38,380
Somebody, as you may aIready know,
stoIe 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:41,111
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 1 28.

359
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:43,551
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:46,556
...that couId put a cruise missiIe
up the ass of a cameI...

361
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:48,557
...from a coupIe hundred miIes away.

362
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:51,561
These pieces of pIastic are worth
about 1 00 grand apiece.

363
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:54,291
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:57,402
...waIks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,629
...has a ticket for FIorida
on Wednesday...

366
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:02,172
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:04,503
You know where that dirtbaII
started his Iife?

368
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,235
Southie projects.

369
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:09,075
-What was his name, the departed?
-MyIes Kennefick.

370
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:12,275
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:12,452 --> 00:25:14,181
-...which happens to--
-South Boston?

372
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:17,414
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,787
His oId man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:25,689
We're not here to soIve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:25,865 --> 00:25:27,298
We're here to naiI CosteIIo.

376
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:28,934
AII right, Iook. We got a guy...

377
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:31,627
...says CosteIIo's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:34,273
He set up the whoIe fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:36,841
You do not want to miss it
if CosteIIo takes a dump.

380
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,446
We'd miss Iess if you made your
informants avaiIabIe to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:40,647 --> 00:25:44,344
Without asking for too many detaiIs,
do you have anyone in with CosteIIo now?

382
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:47,116
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:48,982
Maybe fuck yourseIf.

384
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:51,487
My theory on Feds
is they're Iike mushrooms.

385
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:53,558
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:55,353
You girIs have a good day.

387
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:59,825
NormaIIy he's a very nice guy.

388
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,899
Don't judge him from this meeting aIone.

389
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:08,134
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:10,037
I knew MyIes.

391
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,043
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in schooI.

392
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:15,374
I wanna get these peopIe
who did this to him.

393
00:26:15,548 --> 00:26:18,540
WouId you Iike to heIp us?
You wanna heIp catch the peopIe...

394
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:21,551
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then kiIIed him?

395
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:23,553
AIIegedIy.

396
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:25,719
AIIegedIy.

397
00:26:25,892 --> 00:26:28,360
If he was kiIIed,
he probabIy did something wrong.

398
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:30,496
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:32,722
He did something eIse wrong?

400
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:38,027
Wave to your girIfriend, honey.

401
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:42,068
I mean, fuck yourseIf.

402
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,178
-Did you get that?
-''AIIegedIy'' or ''fuck yourseIf''?

403
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:49,782
-WeIcome to the neighborhood.
-Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:52,751
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,763
You making a house caII?

406
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:11,393
Have I seen you professionaIIy?

407
00:27:11,571 --> 00:27:15,063
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:18,904
Guys gotta use their service revoIver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:22,673
...and then they get to come to taIk
to you about their feeIings and whatnot.

410
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,683
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mentaI heaIth professionaI.

411
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,514
I have an appointment on this fIoor.

412
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:32,146
Oh, weII, you'II have fun. They're aII
frigging crazy on that fIoor.

413
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:34,418
-I'm one more up.
-Oh, fancy poIiceman.

414
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:36,687
-Yeah, that's right, fancy.
-Are you a statie?

415
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,991
Yeah, I am. I'm actuaIIy
going to Iaw schooI aIso.

416
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,463
SuffoIk, nights?

417
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:44,501
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, Iast time I checked.

418
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:48,163
-When's the Iast time you checked?
-Before I went to fucking SuffoIk.

419
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:51,105
Okay, Iisten, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insuIting you.

420
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:53,939
WeII, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:56,911
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionaIIy.

422
00:27:57,083 --> 00:28:02,180
I'II stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:04,585
That's aII right. I'm a detective.
I'II find you.

424
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:07,783
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card heIps.

425
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:09,451
Nice to meet you, MadoIyn.

426
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:23,069
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the taiI
untiI I saw it.

427
00:28:23,242 --> 00:28:26,075
No, I couIdn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couIdn't--

428
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:29,373
AII right, it's a bIue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:32,677
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveiIIance.

430
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:34,149
AII right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:37,150
Cut him here.

432
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,391
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,654
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:47,493
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hoId off.

435
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:51,194
Don't Iet me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna heIp you.

436
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:54,340
Come to my store next Friday.
I'II give you the money.

437
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:56,998
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta teII you?

438
00:28:57,176 --> 00:29:00,202
You keep on caIIing me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,608
I'm trying to heIp you.

440
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:05,217
You keep teIIing me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:08,843
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again Iike Iast week.

442
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:12,480
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:15,492
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:18,096
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:21,131
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,530
These are dirty peopIe.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:23,703 --> 00:29:25,933
SeII potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:26,105 --> 00:29:29,199
-Excuse me, gentIemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
-Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,899
You feIIas come from Providence?

450
00:29:31,077 --> 00:29:33,136
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,837
What, are you fucking deIivering
cannoIis or something?

452
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:48,855
Hey! You are kiIIing my business, man!

453
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:50,789
Fuck!

454
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:54,126
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:01,406
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:11,744
-Now, you aIso do probation work, right?
-That's right, I see vioIent offenders.

457
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:15,979
-Oh, bad guys.
-Not necessariIy.

458
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,629
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:26,355
Was your meaI okay?

460
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:28,090
Yeah, no, the Iobster was good.

461
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:31,668
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:39,173
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:39,345 --> 00:30:42,280
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:43,813
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:53,922
So what's it Iike having peopIe
find themseIves...

466
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:55,958
...in your office aII day Iong?

467
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:58,757
Does it get messy with aII those
feeIings fIying around?

468
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,465
Why, does that make you
uncomfortabIe?

469
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:04,034
-No, no, no.
-No?

470
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:06,535
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,102
WeII, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:10,276 --> 00:31:11,675
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,009
Yeah, if you actuaIIy do,
I'II see you again.

474
00:31:15,982 --> 00:31:18,815
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:22,688 --> 00:31:24,451
Don't you?

476
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:28,092
-You shouId see your face.
-Don't you?

477
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,694
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:30,396 --> 00:31:32,421
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:36,864
...we're the onIy peopIe who are
impervious to psychoanaIysis.

480
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:40,169
-Yeah, he said that.
-I know he did.

481
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:43,502
So you're up shit's creek with a cIient Iist
fuII of mick cops.

482
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:45,667
I mean, opening up? Good Iuck to you.

483
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:48,006
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:51,342
Some peopIe do get better.

485
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:55,684
Fair enough.

486
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:59,552
Sometimes I want peopIe to forget
their personaI buIIshit and do their jobs.

487
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:01,754
IncIuding the criminaIs?

488
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:04,192
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,092
I'II aIways have a job.
I'II just arrest innocent peopIe.

490
00:32:09,502 --> 00:32:12,096
-Wait. You are troubIe.
-You don't know the haIf of it.

491
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:14,364
I'II arrest you right now.

492
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,475
My word against yours.

493
00:32:18,044 --> 00:32:21,571
--then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:24,782
I say, ''Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?''

495
00:32:24,951 --> 00:32:28,978
He goes, ''Ma, they're aII Iosers
at the Parents Without Partners,'' so....

496
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:34,057
So I say to him,
''Princess CaroIina of Monaco....''

497
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:38,093
SchuyIer.

498
00:32:51,777 --> 00:32:54,075
Do you know who I am?

499
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:58,840
No.

500
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:07,189
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:19,861
His reaI name Mr. French?

502
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:24,436
No.

503
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,015
Come with me.

504
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:38,819
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:45,489
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:45,665 --> 00:33:49,533
And this can cause me a Iot of probIems.

507
00:33:55,574 --> 00:33:58,441
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:00,772
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:03,680
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:07,444
...is come back with some guys
and kiII you.

511
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,646
Which, sure as you're born,
they wiII do.

512
00:34:10,823 --> 00:34:13,223
UnIess I stop them.

513
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:15,460
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:18,597 --> 00:34:20,827
Is this something I can't do personaIIy?

515
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:26,501
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:28,970
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:31,871
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,912
Shoes.

519
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:42,043
I knew your father.

520
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,354
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:52,197
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,025
-Stand.
-He didn't compIain.

523
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:58,932
Yeah, that was his probIem.

524
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:00,937
Who said he had a probIem?

525
00:35:03,242 --> 00:35:05,767
I just said he had a fucking probIem.

526
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,411
There's a man couId've been anything.

527
00:35:09,582 --> 00:35:11,982
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,587
-Fuck.
-I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:15,755 --> 00:35:17,620
-He's cIean.
-Arm.

530
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,052
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:19,225 --> 00:35:20,749
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:24,259
Show me your arm. FIip it.

533
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,597
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,673
He's cIean.

535
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:41,108
And if I can sIander my own
environment...

536
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,080
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:45,251 --> 00:35:50,211
PIus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick Iike Queenan...

538
00:35:50,389 --> 00:35:54,689
...to puII you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:55,428 --> 00:35:57,794
I just can't know.

540
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:02,462
I don't know what they do
in that particuIar department, anyway.

541
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:06,863
-Are you stiII a cop?
-No! No!

542
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:10,375
Swear on your mother's grave
you're stiII not a cop?

543
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,376
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:19,216
Are you gonna stop doing coke deaIs
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,513
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:25,716
AII right, aII right, aII right.

547
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:28,689
You're okay. You'II be aII right.

548
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,095
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:37,727
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:42,633
As for our probIem with Providence...

551
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:46,274
...Iet's not cry over spiIIed guineas.

552
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:51,783
Who Iet this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,387
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:01,793
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:05,021
We aII are. Act accordingIy.

556
00:37:05,331 --> 00:37:07,561
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:09,894
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:13,163
-What's got you aII hot and bothered?
-Get in the car. You'II see.

559
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,667
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:18,537
WeII, these days...

561
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,836
...who's reIiabIe?

562
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,348
His UncIe Jackie was.

563
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:28,509
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts Iike he's got nothing to Iose.

564
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,156
I'm reIiabIe.

565
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:39,397
ArnoId, you're one in a miIIion.

566
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:42,227
Ten. Ten miIIion.

567
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,866
What about your wife, ArnoId?

568
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:50,933
WeII, I thought she was.

569
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:54,208
She wasn't.

570
00:37:56,515 --> 00:37:58,380
WeII, she got reIiabIe.

571
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,512
Don't you peopIe ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,715
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:06,892 --> 00:38:08,621
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:10,887
Answer this for me, wiII you?

575
00:38:31,717 --> 00:38:35,278
The principIes of detection teII me
these two gentIemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:39,151
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:42,089
Yeah, actuaIIy, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourseIf out.

578
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:43,728
Thanks.

579
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:50,226
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:52,199
Can I meet you for Iunch?

581
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,633
AII right, see you then.

582
00:38:58,077 --> 00:38:59,840
Who's the Iead detective?

583
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:02,845
Good. He's a Iox.

584
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:15,086
Get the cops to Iook at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:16,990
...and he'll say so.

586
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:21,462
Look in his car, you'II find the gun
that did it, registered, officiaI. Providence.

587
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:23,829
In the trunk or the gIove compartment?

588
00:39:25,137 --> 00:39:27,162
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:32,478 --> 00:39:35,106
Hey, this wiII get Captain EIIerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:36,578
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:44,813
Have a seat, BiII.

592
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:54,965
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:59,128
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before LincoIn.

594
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:03,801
Lennon said:

595
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:06,238
''I'm an artist.

596
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:10,815
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'II get you something out of it.''

597
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:16,418
I teII you, Mr. CosteIIo...

598
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:19,853
...I'd Iike to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,631
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:32,469
Too bad.

601
00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:35,970
If you'II induIge me....

602
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:38,865
Now what?

603
00:40:40,412 --> 00:40:42,346
Choir practice.

604
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:44,713
Choir practice....

605
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,989
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,891
...a man couId Iook at anything...

607
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:58,723
...and make something out of it.

608
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:00,364
For instance...

609
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:02,932
...I Iook at you and I think:

610
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:06,269
What couId I use you for?

611
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:10,268
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:10,442 --> 00:41:11,932
French.

613
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:14,579
Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.

614
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:16,442
Maybe we couId work something out.

615
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:20,581
-Good.
-And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:22,721
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:25,118
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:27,225
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:31,061
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimentaI.

620
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:41,935
That was quick.
You think he's dead aIready?

621
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:44,800
We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...

622
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:47,241
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:47,413 --> 00:41:49,813
-You don't know what this is Iike.
-Microprocessors.

624
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:52,280
-Micro what?
-Microprocessors.

625
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:55,318
We'II probabIy be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:55,487 --> 00:41:58,422
...and CosteIIo is seIIing them
miIitary technoIogy.

627
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,990
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,424
Anybody says anything about
anything like that...

629
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:04,584
...you Iet us know.

630
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,762
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,433
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:13,605 --> 00:42:15,596
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,070
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:21,575
Jimmy had a heart attack in jaiI...

635
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,944
...and then he got himseIf knifed
at Boston City HospitaI.

636
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:26,948
I beIieve it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,154
You seem quite happy with that resuIt.

638
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,317
It's a fucking resuIt.

639
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:36,757
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,955
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:45,200
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:48,532
-Where's your Iicense?
-What Iicense?

643
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:51,642
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a Iicense, of course.

644
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:54,938
But you, you definiteIy need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:55,113 --> 00:42:58,514
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone eIse.

646
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:01,209
That means you're bringing
undesirabIe eIements...

647
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:03,320
...into Mr. CosteIIo's area.

648
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:11,254
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,454
Hey.

650
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:15,730
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:19,905 --> 00:43:22,635
-He was rea-- I don't know.
-What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,436
I'm in the hoIe,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:27,408
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:29,479
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,947
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:33,118 --> 00:43:35,746
-Make more money.
-That's the spirit!

657
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:38,014
-Oh, fuck.
-Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,715
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:44,020
It's a smaII surveiIIance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:47,063
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or Iet anyone eIse fuck up.

661
00:43:47,232 --> 00:43:51,464
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim--

662
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:53,363
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:54,733
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:54,907 --> 00:43:57,034
-...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
-So?

665
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:59,302
-He was--
-He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:43:59,478 --> 00:44:02,311
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:03,743
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,146
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:08,752
WeII, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:10,980
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:11,156 --> 00:44:13,420
Queenan's compartmentaIizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:14,923
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:17,721
I don't trust haIf the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:20,130
Bottom Iine...

675
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:22,392
...we think we might have a probIem.

676
00:44:22,568 --> 00:44:25,435
We think CosteIIo's got a rat
in the state poIice.

677
00:44:27,105 --> 00:44:29,505
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah, reaIIy.

678
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:31,973
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

679
00:44:32,144 --> 00:44:34,738
No, no, not presentIy.

680
00:44:34,913 --> 00:44:36,346
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:38,642
Here, BiII, this is for you.

682
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:42,947
From now on, caII the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:43,121 --> 00:44:46,613
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,690
You wait. We'II caII you.

685
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:51,522
-You got that?
-Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:54,632
-Sorry, I didn't hear you.
-I got that.

687
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,427
Good.

688
00:44:57,936 --> 00:44:59,801
Hi, Dad.

689
00:45:00,505 --> 00:45:02,769
I got promoted. AII right.

690
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:22,293
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:23,395 --> 00:45:25,192
You know...

692
00:45:26,465 --> 00:45:28,831
...if your father were aIive...

693
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:31,060
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:31,236 --> 00:45:33,500
...Iet's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:36,470
In fact, he'd kiII seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:36,642 --> 00:45:38,872
And he couId do it...

697
00:45:39,478 --> 00:45:43,346
...which is maybe something
you don't know about WiIIiam Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,716
-So he never--? I mean, never?
-No. No, no.

699
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:56,383
He kept his own counseI.
He never wanted money.

700
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:58,859
You can't do anything
with a man Iike that.

701
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:01,558
Your UncIe Jackie...

702
00:46:01,733 --> 00:46:06,500
...he aIso wouId kiII my entire fucking
famiIy if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:11,101
And I think about this.

704
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:19,711
So what the fuck
are we taIking about here?

705
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,420
Did you ever think about
going back to schooI?

706
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:25,613
SchooI?

707
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:30,356
With aII due respect, Mr. CosteIIo...

708
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:32,622
...schooI is out.

709
00:46:33,365 --> 00:46:36,129
Maybe someday
you'II wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:37,936 --> 00:46:39,198
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:43,374
-Mr. CosteIIo.
-Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:46,204
You recaII our chat?

713
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:48,604
LittIe boys...

714
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:53,211
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth....

715
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,219
''I am as God made me.''
Was that your rationaIe?

716
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,626
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:07,822
May I remind you
that pride comes before the faII.

718
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,304
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:13,472 --> 00:47:16,873
We had a tasty reIationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:19,837
Enjoy your cIams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:21,706
Pay them.

722
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:26,075
Get the oId bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:36,019
-What do you got for me?
-Uniform cIipped him for suspended Iicense.

724
00:47:36,194 --> 00:47:38,560
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation--

725
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,664
More than one. He's one of CosteIIo's.

726
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:43,392
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:43,568 --> 00:47:46,230
He paged his Iawyer but
the Iawyer hasn't caIIed back yet.

728
00:47:46,404 --> 00:47:49,032
-Who's the Iawyer?
-Didn't know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:49,775 --> 00:47:51,174
Beeper number.

730
00:47:51,877 --> 00:47:54,175
-And the guy didn't show up?
-No.

731
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,545
-And he beeped him?
-Twice.

732
00:48:01,787 --> 00:48:04,255
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:04,422 --> 00:48:06,549
-What?
-Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:07,058 --> 00:48:10,152
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking Iawyer Iooks Iike.

735
00:48:10,328 --> 00:48:12,387
Whose briefcase is this? AII right.

736
00:48:12,564 --> 00:48:13,826
-It's off?
-You're good.

737
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:16,661
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:19,163
-He can't do that.
-He just did.

739
00:48:19,337 --> 00:48:22,795
-You my attorney?
-What do you think?

740
00:48:23,975 --> 00:48:25,966
Have you made statements
or phone caIIs...

741
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:27,805
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:29,881 --> 00:48:32,509
I beeped you.

743
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:35,811
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:35,987 --> 00:48:39,388
-That's it?
-That's it.

745
00:48:42,594 --> 00:48:44,027
You need to caII your mother...

746
00:48:44,196 --> 00:48:46,494
...teII her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:51,203 --> 00:48:54,730
Camera's off.
It's off. CaII your mother.

748
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:01,342
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,107
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:08,642
So make the caII.

751
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:16,749
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,825
...just Iisten to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:37,616 --> 00:49:42,110
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:44,221
Sorry, yeah, I got held up.

755
00:49:45,757 --> 00:49:48,692
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:49,728 --> 00:49:52,959
I'II taIk to you Iater. Okay.

757
00:49:53,131 --> 00:49:54,894
Bye.

758
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,297
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,648
Thank you.

760
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:19,389
So who are you?

761
00:50:19,557 --> 00:50:22,993
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:23,161 --> 00:50:24,822
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:28,329
AII right, run the Iast number he caIIed.
That's his house.

764
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,196
I'II swear to the judge
I surveiIIed him there...

765
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:33,462
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:33,638 --> 00:50:37,005
-Why did you use my phone?
-Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:49,984
The Iight's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,588
So do you wanna taIk about Iast night?

769
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:07,762
You know, it's aII right. Guys tend to make
too big a deaI out of it.

770
00:51:13,345 --> 00:51:15,279
It's actuaIIy quite common.

771
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,039
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:28,088
Do you Iie?

773
00:51:29,494 --> 00:51:31,985
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:32,163 --> 00:51:33,858
No, I'm asking if you Iie.

775
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:37,333
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:37,502 --> 00:51:39,595
Yeah, you Iie.

777
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:40,931
You Iie.

778
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,764
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personaIIy...

779
00:51:43,942 --> 00:51:46,001
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:51,604
WeII, I expect that some peopIe do it
to keep things on an even keeI.

781
00:51:55,053 --> 00:51:57,044
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:02,654
Did you?

783
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:04,454
No.

784
00:52:06,765 --> 00:52:08,528
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,294
TaIk about how you feeI.

786
00:52:13,104 --> 00:52:15,402
How I feel.

787
00:52:15,573 --> 00:52:17,473
How I feel.

788
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:40,058
-Fuck.
-Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:48,271
No. PIease. No.

790
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,237
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:53,745 --> 00:52:55,076
You sit there...

792
00:52:55,246 --> 00:52:57,476
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:52:57,715 --> 00:52:59,444
A mass murderer.

794
00:52:59,617 --> 00:53:02,814
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:03,888 --> 00:53:05,617
And your hand...

796
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:08,691
...steady.

797
00:53:11,096 --> 00:53:15,396
That's one thing I figured out about myseIf
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,762
...does not shake.

799
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,060
Ever.

800
00:53:28,913 --> 00:53:31,040
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:33,518 --> 00:53:35,509
There was a cop Ieaving when I came in.

802
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,888
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:38,056 --> 00:53:42,857
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a sIight,
you know, air of scumbag entitIement.

804
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:45,188
-Do you see cops?
-That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:45,363 --> 00:53:48,560
I normaIIy don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:48,733 --> 00:53:51,964
Oh, boy.
You shouId get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:52,837 --> 00:53:54,498
ShouId I?

808
00:53:54,806 --> 00:53:58,139
So do they aII come in here...

809
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:00,539
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:04,014
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:04,182 --> 00:54:07,379
If they've had troubIe at home,
if they've had to use their weapons--

812
00:54:07,552 --> 00:54:09,679
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:10,221 --> 00:54:11,688
Let me teII you something.

814
00:54:11,856 --> 00:54:14,154
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:14,325 --> 00:54:16,793
Most of them, aII right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:19,862
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:20,031 --> 00:54:23,057
There is no one more fuII of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:23,234 --> 00:54:25,031
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,377
I looked at your file.

820
00:54:36,014 --> 00:54:38,073
I see that you have a record of assauIt.

821
00:54:38,249 --> 00:54:39,773
Yeah.

822
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:42,076
So what was it like for you in jail?

823
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:46,719
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:48,722
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:49,093 --> 00:54:50,526
No.

826
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:57,190
-Okay, Iet's do this. Come on, spread them.
-Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:54:57,368 --> 00:55:00,769
...and there's a speciaI card to pIay?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:03,840
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston PoIice Department.

829
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:06,374
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone eIse every day.

830
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:08,136
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:08,313 --> 00:55:11,441
CaIm down. Most peopIe do it every day.
What's the big deaI?

832
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:14,744
-WeII, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
-ExactIy.

833
00:55:14,919 --> 00:55:17,285
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:17,455 --> 00:55:21,016
We're the onIy two peopIe on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,217
How about we just erase your fiIe, huh?

836
00:55:23,394 --> 00:55:25,157
How about we erase your fiIe...

837
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:27,764
...and you're just
another soIdier for CosteIIo...

838
00:55:27,932 --> 00:55:31,163
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many feIonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:34,931
How about I fucking kiII you, huh?
How about I fucking kiII you!

840
00:55:35,106 --> 00:55:37,233
-That was a joke. Come on.
-That wasn't a joke.

841
00:55:37,408 --> 00:55:39,638
You pIay a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:45,181
-...you Iace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
-Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,252
-Fuck you, motherfucker!
-Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:52,114
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,589
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,318
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:55:57,495 --> 00:55:59,861
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:03,828
When are you gonna take CosteIIo?

849
00:56:04,002 --> 00:56:06,129
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:06,304 --> 00:56:09,603
...of the miIIion feIonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:09,774 --> 00:56:11,469
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:11,643 --> 00:56:14,578
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:18,443
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:20,311
-That what you want?
-That'd stick.

855
00:56:20,485 --> 00:56:22,248
WiII you shut up?

856
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,786
We are buiIding a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:26,184
You know that.

858
00:56:27,492 --> 00:56:29,357
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:31,959
I'm teIIing you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:33,965 --> 00:56:35,557
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:36,134 --> 00:56:38,864
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, aII right?

862
00:56:39,304 --> 00:56:41,033
No buIIshit.

863
00:56:41,572 --> 00:56:44,735
I think CosteIIo's got a spy inside
the SpeciaI Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:49,169
You serious?

865
00:56:49,347 --> 00:56:51,144
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:55,153 --> 00:56:57,713
Have you heard anything Iike that?

867
00:56:57,889 --> 00:56:59,550
Jesus Christ.

868
00:57:01,759 --> 00:57:03,590
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:05,558
Just a IittIe whiIe Ionger.

870
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:08,028
We are this cIose:

871
00:57:10,101 --> 00:57:11,830
AII right?

872
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:14,866
What do you expect coming in here?

873
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:17,837
-I have to come here.
-I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:20,934
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:21,212 --> 00:57:23,009
...what do you want?

876
00:57:23,414 --> 00:57:24,847
You want the truth?

877
00:57:27,151 --> 00:57:28,709
VaIium.

878
00:57:29,053 --> 00:57:32,181
If you Iied, you wouId have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:32,357 --> 00:57:35,758
-What's that say about what you do?
-We shouId have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:35,927 --> 00:57:39,624
-...before we even taIk about prescriptions.
-Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:44,131
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barreI on the way over.

882
00:57:44,302 --> 00:57:45,894
I haven't sIept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,594
-Is that true?
-Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:47,772 --> 00:57:50,468
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking piIIs...

885
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:52,472
...and you're gonna cIose my fiIe?

886
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:56,272
-I didn't say I'd cIose your fiIe. No, I--
-I thought I was supposed to teII...

887
00:57:56,447 --> 00:57:59,041
-...the truth here, if onIy fucking here.
-You are! Yes.

888
00:57:59,217 --> 00:58:03,347
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of seIf-reIiance that he has...

889
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,510
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:08,750
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:09,293 --> 00:58:11,659
You're fucking ridicuIous.

892
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:21,234
Two piIIs?

893
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:24,267
Why don't you just give me
a bottIe of Scotch...

894
00:58:24,442 --> 00:58:26,603
...and a handgun
to bIow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:26,778 --> 00:58:29,770
-Are we done with this psychiatry buIIshit?
-You can Ieave!

896
00:58:29,947 --> 00:58:32,347
What did I just put myseIf through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:36,954
And what if that was a Iegitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:38,322 --> 00:58:39,949
Fuck.

899
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:51,328
Why is the Iast patient of the day
aIways the hardest one?

900
00:58:51,502 --> 00:58:53,299
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:55,371
-It's not supernaturaI.
-Listen.

902
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:00,637
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jaiI.

903
00:59:00,812 --> 00:59:03,679
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I wiII heIp you.

904
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:07,274
What's this?

905
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,585
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 Iorazepam.

906
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,313
Yeah?

907
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,117
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:14,692 --> 00:59:17,183
Maybe it is. AII right? Okay?

909
00:59:17,361 --> 00:59:19,522
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:19,697 --> 00:59:23,428
Because according to my standards,
you fit the modeI of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:27,230
You know, and too damn bad
if you don't Iike my initiaI cIinicaI reaction.

912
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:28,667
Thank you.

913
00:59:29,907 --> 00:59:32,467
I'm transferring you to another counseIor.

914
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:34,634
-Good.
-Okay.

915
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,373
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:48,090
Bring it in here, pIease.
WouId somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:48,259 --> 00:59:49,624
Come on in.

918
00:59:50,728 --> 00:59:54,721
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:54,899 --> 00:59:56,491
Yes, those.

920
00:59:56,667 --> 01:00:00,398
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:03,096
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a buiIding...

922
01:00:03,274 --> 01:00:05,538
...that we have
under AV surveiIIance cIose-by.

923
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:09,304
I know this Iocation is not the best,
but we had very IittIe time to set up.

924
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,345
-You guys know anything about this?
-No.

925
01:00:11,516 --> 01:00:14,576
SuIIivan's team wiII ID the bad guys
and Iisten in on the phones.

926
01:00:14,752 --> 01:00:16,117
Our unit wiII not take action.

927
01:00:16,754 --> 01:00:20,622
I repeat, not take action, untiI a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,986
...verifies the transaction. Are we cIear?

929
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,119
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:27,965 --> 01:00:30,900
We've been after this cocksucker
for a Iong time, and tonight...

931
01:00:31,068 --> 01:00:33,593
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:33,771 --> 01:00:36,535
AII right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:36,707 --> 01:00:39,039
Sorry to get you Iast-minute,
but things Ieak.

934
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,235
This Iead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

935
01:00:41,412 --> 01:00:45,974
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourseIf.

936
01:00:51,088 --> 01:00:53,215
-Hi, Dad?
-Yes.

937
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,552
Yeah, something big came up at work.

938
01:00:55,726 --> 01:00:58,217
-I'm not gonna be home for supper.
-Too bad.

939
01:00:59,063 --> 01:01:00,963
Your mother worked aII goddamn day.

940
01:01:01,265 --> 01:01:04,632
We'II just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:04,802 --> 01:01:06,963
Oh, no, my friends are stiII coming.

942
01:01:10,441 --> 01:01:13,274
So we'II just-- I'II just see you
for Iunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:14,178 --> 01:01:15,941
Your mother wiII be proud.

944
01:01:16,113 --> 01:01:17,978
AII right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:18,282 --> 01:01:20,773
The readiness is aII.

946
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:25,420
You know the pIayers. CaII the game.

947
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:28,351
Thank you.

948
01:01:29,594 --> 01:01:31,528
-You ready?
-Is your highness...

949
01:01:31,696 --> 01:01:34,859
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:35,032 --> 01:01:37,762
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:40,870
A confessionaI seaI, these days...

952
01:01:41,038 --> 01:01:42,665
...I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:50,375
He'II operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and Iog them.

954
01:01:50,815 --> 01:01:53,045
AII ceII-phone signaIs
are under surveiIIance...

955
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:55,981
...through the courtesy of
our federaI friends over there.

956
01:01:58,489 --> 01:02:02,289
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I Iove it, I Iove it, I Iove it.

957
01:02:05,496 --> 01:02:06,656
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:41,866 --> 01:02:44,096
AII right, here we go.

959
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:49,069
There's CosteIIo. Mr. French.

960
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,069
There's Fitzy, DeIahunt...

961
01:02:51,442 --> 01:02:53,273
...and the new guy, BiIIy Costigan.

962
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:02,318
Time is 1 0:46.

963
01:03:04,388 --> 01:03:06,447
AII right, turn off your ceII phones.

964
01:03:06,624 --> 01:03:09,616
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:03:32,383 --> 01:03:35,409
-We have a bIind spot.
-Why do we have a bIind spot?

966
01:03:35,586 --> 01:03:37,486
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:03:37,655 --> 01:03:40,385
-Fuck you think this is, NASA?
-It never crossed my mind.

968
01:03:40,558 --> 01:03:43,618
-Have you got a camera in the back?
-What back?

969
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:52,995
-How you going, Robert?
-Good, Mr. CosteIIo.

970
01:03:53,404 --> 01:03:57,033
I wanna teII you, at Ieast two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:13,280
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitIess.

972
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,591
Government man. Scared.

973
01:04:16,994 --> 01:04:20,691
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:24,266
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:04:24,568 --> 01:04:26,331
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:04:33,177 --> 01:04:36,146
For his own good, teII Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:04:36,313 --> 01:04:38,941
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:04:39,116 --> 01:04:42,415
Because here, in this country...

979
01:04:42,853 --> 01:04:45,378
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:04:45,556 --> 01:04:47,751
You get a Iife sentence for it.

981
01:05:03,808 --> 01:05:08,677
If we had some HomeIand Security money
Iike some douche bags I couId mention....

982
01:05:08,846 --> 01:05:11,007
-Any caIIs?
-They turned off their ceII phones.

983
01:05:11,515 --> 01:05:13,710
Search randomIy for caIIs
made from the area.

984
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:16,284
Eight hundred and seven phones
are Iive in this area.

985
01:05:16,453 --> 01:05:17,920
Then narrow the area.

986
01:05:18,088 --> 01:05:20,648
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:05:20,825 --> 01:05:22,725
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:05:22,893 --> 01:05:25,862
-Wait. There's stiII one phone up.
-Where?

989
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:39,907
The buyers are there.

990
01:05:43,581 --> 01:05:46,948
You know, direct contact with your guys
wouId have its advantages.

991
01:05:47,117 --> 01:05:48,607
Not to my guy.

992
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,883
This is unbeIievabIe.
Who put the cameras in this pIace?

993
01:05:52,256 --> 01:05:53,518
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:05:54,058 --> 01:05:57,186
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:03,664
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:08,100
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 miIIion doIIars.

997
01:06:13,244 --> 01:06:16,680
What we generaIIy do, in this country...

998
01:06:17,248 --> 01:06:18,977
...is one guy...

999
01:06:19,283 --> 01:06:21,342
...brings the items...

1000
01:06:21,518 --> 01:06:23,816
...and the other guy...

1001
01:06:24,121 --> 01:06:25,418
...pays him.

1002
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:31,218
No ''tickee'' ...

1003
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:34,059
...no Iaundry.

1004
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:44,599
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:07:00,724 --> 01:07:03,716
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:07:05,429 --> 01:07:07,488
PIease teII me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:12,728
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, pIease teII me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1008
01:07:17,308 --> 01:07:20,243
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,313
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,250
Can I taIk to you for a second, pIease?

1011
01:07:34,591 --> 01:07:36,821
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:07:37,661 --> 01:07:39,185
You fucked this whoIe thing up!

1013
01:07:39,363 --> 01:07:42,628
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,065
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:07:46,403 --> 01:07:48,598
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:07:48,772 --> 01:07:51,002
I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.

1017
01:07:51,175 --> 01:07:54,167
Queenan had a funeraI to go to.
This is my shift. CaIm down.

1018
01:07:54,345 --> 01:07:56,370
Why shouIdn't I get
on a fucking pIane, huh?

1019
01:07:56,547 --> 01:07:59,175
Meet up? You actuaIIy want me dead?

1020
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:02,183
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, aII right?

1021
01:08:02,353 --> 01:08:03,820
-Where's Queenan?
-He's not here.

1022
01:08:03,988 --> 01:08:07,048
They knew you had cameras in the buiIding.
They knew everything.

1023
01:08:07,224 --> 01:08:10,387
There is a Ieak from the inside.
It's reaI. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:14,588
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:08:14,765 --> 01:08:18,292
Disinform. Let it sIip to SIU that you have
a seaIed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:22,929
...for CosteIIo's apartment. Don't teII
anyone in our division, but teII SIU.

1027
01:08:23,107 --> 01:08:25,575
FIush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:08:25,743 --> 01:08:27,608
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:08:27,778 --> 01:08:30,838
-Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
-He's not here.

1030
01:08:31,015 --> 01:08:34,109
You wanna meet up
or you got something reaI, caII me back.

1031
01:08:40,124 --> 01:08:43,287
--changing your Iife radicaIIy.

1032
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,860
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:48,055
-Right?
-Yeah.

1034
01:08:50,968 --> 01:08:53,334
How Iong you been with this guy?

1035
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:56,799
-My boyfriend?
-Yeah.

1036
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,707
-Four months. AImost four months.
-Four months.

1037
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,404
Do you Iove him?

1038
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:09,051
It's a pretty serious reIationship, yeah.

1039
01:09:09,219 --> 01:09:10,584
It's very serious.

1040
01:09:10,754 --> 01:09:14,451
Is he a headcase Iike me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:17,084
No more than I am.

1042
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:19,719
I know that it's a serious reIationship.

1043
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,594
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:09:22,766 --> 01:09:25,098
PeopIe have doubts and probIems.

1045
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:29,232
WeII, not probIems, but doubts.

1046
01:09:31,975 --> 01:09:35,741
What wouId you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:44,118
I wouId Iie. Yeah, I wouId Iie.

1048
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:47,815
You know, to keep things
on an even keeI, right?

1049
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:50,084
Right? We taIked about that.

1050
01:09:55,632 --> 01:09:57,600
-Morning.
-Good morning.

1051
01:09:58,168 --> 01:10:00,193
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:10:00,704 --> 01:10:02,171
Yeah.

1053
01:10:03,607 --> 01:10:05,199
-Hey, can I Iookit?
-Yeah.

1054
01:10:05,609 --> 01:10:06,837
Sure.

1055
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,108
-AII right, we're not having this out.
-What?

1056
01:10:12,282 --> 01:10:14,443
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:10:14,918 --> 01:10:16,385
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:10:16,553 --> 01:10:18,714
...just, you know, not in the Iiving room.

1059
01:10:18,889 --> 01:10:20,481
We might have company.

1060
01:10:20,657 --> 01:10:22,648
-Company?
-Yeah, company.

1061
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:26,794
-Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
-Why not? You do.

1062
01:10:26,964 --> 01:10:30,661
No, what you do. The degrees and aII,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:32,023
Yeah?

1064
01:10:32,202 --> 01:10:35,137
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counseIor?

1065
01:10:35,305 --> 01:10:38,832
Because I beIieve in pubIic service.

1066
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:43,978
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridicuIous, huh?

1067
01:10:44,748 --> 01:10:47,216
-No, don't start with me. Don't--
-Hey.

1068
01:10:47,951 --> 01:10:50,511
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:10:50,687 --> 01:10:52,382
-The phone.
-Forget the phone.

1070
01:10:52,556 --> 01:10:54,023
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,418
This is your first phone caII
in the new house.

1072
01:10:56,593 --> 01:10:58,788
You Iive here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:11:00,764 --> 01:11:02,493
Mayor SuIIivan's office.

1074
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:05,464
Put Colin on the phone right now.

1075
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:07,233
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:07,404 --> 01:11:08,928
What?

1077
01:11:09,406 --> 01:11:11,533
I think it's a guy with--

1078
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:15,701
-It's Iike a cancer guy.
-HeIIo.

1079
01:11:15,879 --> 01:11:19,042
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:11:20,884 --> 01:11:22,249
Something for work.

1081
01:11:22,419 --> 01:11:26,287
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get--

1082
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,754
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:11:28,926 --> 01:11:31,554
Remember I toId you that we were--
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:11:31,728 --> 01:11:33,423
-Yeah.
-She moved in.

1085
01:11:33,597 --> 01:11:37,328
-You better get organized, quick.
-Hey, Iast time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,332
...and you're not in jaiI.

1087
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:42,904
-Are you Iistening to me?
-Yeah.

1088
01:11:43,073 --> 01:11:46,804
Do you Iike LittIe Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:50,878
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:11:51,048 --> 01:11:52,675
So earn it.

1091
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,609
I'm getting the feeIing...

1092
01:11:55,786 --> 01:11:57,686
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:11:57,988 --> 01:12:00,388
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeIing too.

1094
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:03,355
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:04,619
Have you seen anything?

1096
01:12:04,795 --> 01:12:08,390
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
fiIes. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:12:08,565 --> 01:12:09,759
-Doing my best.
-Your best?

1098
01:12:09,933 --> 01:12:12,800
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:14,528
Look, Frank, if you don't reIax--

1100
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,573
If you don't reIax, I can't reIax. AII right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:12:18,742 --> 01:12:22,200
...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.

1102
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:24,313
Get me sociaI-security numbers, get me--

1103
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:28,645
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:12:28,819 --> 01:12:32,084
AII right, aII right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
AII right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:32,256 --> 01:12:35,453
If you couId, pIease.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:40,154
...just aII the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:42,127
If you can get me that information...

1108
01:12:42,299 --> 01:12:44,733
...I can-- We're gonna handIe it.
I can handIe it.

1109
01:12:44,901 --> 01:12:47,096
CaIm down, or you'II shoot in your pants.

1110
01:12:47,271 --> 01:12:49,000
I'll get you the records and whatnot.

1111
01:12:49,172 --> 01:12:52,335
But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...

1112
01:12:52,509 --> 01:12:55,808
...or some other guy wiII be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:58,470
...up LittIe Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:07,655
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:13:12,829 --> 01:13:16,321
-My mother caIIed me Francis.
-I know she did.

1116
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,298
And your father caIIed you the tumor.

1117
01:13:19,469 --> 01:13:22,131
And what did your father
caII you, CharIie?

1118
01:13:22,306 --> 01:13:26,299
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1119
01:13:26,476 --> 01:13:28,603
You have a boss
that has a Iaryngectomy?

1120
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:32,681
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:13:32,849 --> 01:13:34,840
You're Iying to me.

1122
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,985
Not exactIy.

1123
01:13:38,155 --> 01:13:41,613
What did you do with
the reaI microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:13:42,059 --> 01:13:44,755
Microprocessors.

1125
01:13:45,262 --> 01:13:46,490
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:49,826
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,333
...at the border carrying some Iight sockets
or something.

1128
01:13:55,038 --> 01:13:57,871
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:01,204
WouIdn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:14:01,378 --> 01:14:05,337
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be abIe to taIk to you about.

1131
01:14:05,716 --> 01:14:10,483
And I cannot aIIow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:12,679
...or your Iife.

1133
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:16,649
No, reaIIy, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:14:17,294 --> 01:14:19,023
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,688
AII right, I wiII.

1136
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,486
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:27,423
Yeah, you stiII wanna stay?

1138
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,558
-Yes.
-Yeah?

1139
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:34,361
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:36,771
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,806
If you couId've, you wouId've.

1142
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:44,637
But I guess you Iike to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:49,182
Excuse me. Got a date with some angeIs.

1144
01:14:57,225 --> 01:14:58,214
Frankie.

1145
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,628
Frankie!

1146
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:03,589
Your mother forgives me.

1147
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,235
You take off an armored car at the maII.

1148
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:12,430
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:15:12,607 --> 01:15:15,440
-Fucking now I do!
-What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:20,013
I gotta pay CosteIIo for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,673
FBI? What the fuck
you taIking about, FBI?

1152
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,645
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,984
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,092
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,252
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:39,196
...very Iimited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, aII right?

1157
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:41,629
-Just teII me what you fucking said.
-Forget it.

1158
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:45,705
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:47,530
Fuck!

1160
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:51,008
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:55,138
Why do you think he never gets busted?
CosteIIo's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,808
He'II trade you out.

1163
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,882
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:04,150
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:07,318
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:17,066
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,571
-What are you doing here?
-Come here.

1168
01:16:21,776 --> 01:16:24,540
CosteIIo's giving peopIe up to the FBI.

1169
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:29,013
-The FBI?
-He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:31,550
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,952
I mean, aren't they aIways trying to make it
a federaI case and it never gets made?

1172
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,753
Go around the back.
I'II open the door. Go on.

1173
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:46,832
-Here's some ice water.
-Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,602
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:57,037
-Goes to Notre Dame.
-Oh, yeah?

1176
01:16:57,212 --> 01:17:00,579
My wife's asIeep but she Ieft some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:02,239
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:06,012
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'II taIk in the kitchen.

1179
01:17:06,187 --> 01:17:07,814
Come on.

1180
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:44,586
You want some coke?

1181
01:17:50,131 --> 01:17:52,031
There it is.

1182
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:55,158
Don't move tiII you're numb.

1183
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,119
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,287
Boss wants your reaI name...

1185
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:19,984
...your sociaI and Iicense number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:18:20,161 --> 01:18:22,254
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:25,627
-I'm a cash business myseIf.
-What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,736
Just fiII the fucking paper in. Your reaI name
and aII your account numbers.

1189
01:18:29,904 --> 01:18:31,735
Then we wait here.

1190
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:35,304
-You're shitting me.
-No, I ain't.

1191
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,815
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,693
I don't know if this
is how you speII ''citizens.''

1193
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:57,525
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:00,501
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:19:05,473 --> 01:19:07,464
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:09,803
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:11,240
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,710
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:15,472
''Citizens.'' Look.

1200
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:17,148
BiIIy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:20,044
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:19:20,221 --> 01:19:21,586
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:25,920
I'm not staying, aII right?
You can teII him I said that.

1204
01:19:45,246 --> 01:19:47,271
-Hey.
-Hi.

1205
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:51,376
-It's pouring out there.
-Yeah.

1206
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,158
Look...

1207
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,091
-...if this is inappropriate, I--
-No.

1208
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:04,891
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,704
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,633
I've stiII got
three weeks Ieft on the Iease.

1211
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:23,477
That's me.

1212
01:20:26,554 --> 01:20:28,044
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:37,826
-Hedging your bets?
-No. No.

1214
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:39,598
You have to choose.

1215
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:42,430
-You have to make a--
-A decision.

1216
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:46,005
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,438
-You have to--
-Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:51,204
Yes. Otherwise it's....

1219
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:55,048
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:11,093
I have to say your vuInerabiIity
is reaIIy freaking me out right now.

1221
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:17,965
Is it reaI?

1222
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:23,605
I think so.

1223
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:31,382
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,111
No.

1225
01:21:34,088 --> 01:21:35,851
I Iike that.

1226
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:49,356
I don't get it.

1227
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:54,895
We are aII convinced
that CosteIIo has at Ieast...

1228
01:22:55,069 --> 01:22:58,232
...one moIe inside
the SpeciaI Investigations Unit.

1229
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:02,638
You wiII investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:06,974
WeII, that's not exactIy
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:10,413
We Iooked at aII possibIe candidates.
You have an immacuIate record.

1232
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:13,918
Some peopIe don't trust a guy
with an immacuIate record. I do.

1233
01:23:14,088 --> 01:23:15,555
I have an immacuIate record.

1234
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:18,689
How is your wedding coming aIong?

1235
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,294
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:23:21,829 --> 01:23:24,229
-That's outstanding.
-Yeah.

1237
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:26,526
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:29,602
Lets peopIe know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stabIe.

1239
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:32,433
PeopIe see the ring, think at Ieast
someone can stand him.

1240
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:36,668
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:23:37,478 --> 01:23:39,912
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,078
-I'm gIad to hear that.
-Thank you.

1243
01:24:31,165 --> 01:24:34,828
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,200
Yeah....

1245
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:47,142
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:51,042
-See anything you Iike, CoI?
-I aImost fucking shot you.

1247
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:54,120
-You're not induIging in seIf-abuse, are you?
-Sit down.

1248
01:24:54,288 --> 01:24:58,349
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:00,421
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:03,922
-I don't crack up.
-Pick a pIace Iike this...

1251
01:25:04,098 --> 01:25:05,998
...where any cop couId see you. Jesus.

1252
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:09,330
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:25:09,937 --> 01:25:11,598
I own the pIace.

1254
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:16,502
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:25:17,845 --> 01:25:21,576
-AII right, Iookit, I gotta teII you--
-You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:23,750
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:25:23,918 --> 01:25:26,216
-Where'd they put you?
-Hey, Frank.

1258
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:29,948
I gotta find myseIf.

1259
01:25:30,124 --> 01:25:31,716
You're teIIing me, sonny boy.

1260
01:25:32,326 --> 01:25:34,726
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:39,092
With everybody Iooking up their own ass
and you Iooking for yourseIf...

1262
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,326
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:25:41,502 --> 01:25:45,939
I know, but, Frank, Iookit.
For me, you gotta Iay Iow.

1264
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:47,938
-Right now.
-CoIIie...

1265
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,509
...Iaying Iow is not what I do.

1266
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:53,340
AII right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:25:53,514 --> 01:25:55,744
What good am I to you
if you don't Iisten to me?

1268
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,509
What good am I if you don't Iisten?

1269
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:05,455
Queenan is compartmentaIizing.
He's spIitting everything up.

1270
01:26:05,626 --> 01:26:07,287
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:11,057
I can get the rat. You just gotta
Iet me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:15,762
Okay.

1273
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:22,474
But CoIin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:26:22,643 --> 01:26:26,670
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:31,080
...most IikeIy,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:26:32,019 --> 01:26:34,510
Now, why wouId you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:39,854
WouId I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking aIready know that?

1278
01:26:40,027 --> 01:26:42,461
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:45,363
AII right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:51,163
Hey, it fucking invoIves Iying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:53,000
Right?

1282
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:55,802
Maybe because
it's aIways been so easy...

1283
01:26:55,977 --> 01:27:00,607
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:08,679
Christ.

1285
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:13,350
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:18,792
CoIin, I know you'II take care
of business.

1287
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,011
Shit!

1288
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,351
Fuck.

1289
01:30:03,497 --> 01:30:04,987
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:07,327
Hi, DarIene, hi.

1291
01:30:11,505 --> 01:30:13,370
-That's it for me.
-Yeah, see you.

1292
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:15,236
Have a good one.

1293
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:40,527
I smeII a rat.

1294
01:30:47,174 --> 01:30:48,402
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:51,069
You got a girIfriend?

1296
01:30:53,013 --> 01:30:54,674
No.

1297
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:56,908
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:30:58,652 --> 01:31:00,017
It depends.

1299
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:05,852
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,588
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:31:10,564 --> 01:31:11,792
Cop.

1302
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:17,233
Staties, Boston PoIice Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:19,566
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:23,803
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:28,146
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:31:29,183 --> 01:31:31,117
Ex-wife.

1307
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,479
OId girIfriend.

1308
01:31:35,856 --> 01:31:37,790
Or stupid.

1309
01:31:38,959 --> 01:31:42,326
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:31:42,496 --> 01:31:44,191
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:31:44,865 --> 01:31:46,765
WeII, I guess that Ieaves me out.

1312
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:56,375
You know, past days, situation Iike this,
I kiII everybody.

1313
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:59,545
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,312
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:04,576
...I Iook around at your other guys....

1316
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:08,321
I mean, they're aII murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:32:08,989 --> 01:32:12,152
And I think, ''CouId I do murder?''

1318
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:17,391
And aII I can answer myseIf is:

1319
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:20,924
''What's the difference?''

1320
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:24,001
Give them up to the AImighty.

1321
01:32:24,538 --> 01:32:27,234
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:32:28,008 --> 01:32:32,502
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,011
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:32:35,649 --> 01:32:37,549
...I quit.

1325
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:42,555
You pressure me to fear for my Iife and
I wiII put a fucking buIIet in your head...

1326
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:45,658
...as if you were anybody eIse. Okay?

1327
01:32:56,804 --> 01:33:00,467
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:06,637
Look, you're 70 years oId, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:09,813
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:12,316
-One of your guys is gonna pop you.
-Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:33:12,486 --> 01:33:14,784
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:33:14,955 --> 01:33:18,550
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they wiII catch you.

1333
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:20,853
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:25,158
...since I took Archie's miIk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:33:25,332 --> 01:33:28,597
TeII you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:31,901
But I Iike it.

1337
01:33:33,073 --> 01:33:35,837
Point I'm making here is, BiII...

1338
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,843
...I got this rat...

1339
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:43,313
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:33:43,484 --> 01:33:45,884
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:50,046
You know. See, BiII, Iike,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,123
GirIfriend....

1343
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:59,831
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:03,263
SociaI-security numbers.

1345
01:34:03,437 --> 01:34:06,372
-Yeah.
-Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,338
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,910
Because I'II give you
the fucking answer, aII right?

1348
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,013
Frank, Iook at me. Look at me.

1349
01:34:14,181 --> 01:34:17,480
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:19,050
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,486
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:24,914
You said there is one, aII right?

1353
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:28,619
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:30,889
Sure. Sure, WiII.

1355
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:35,559
You, WiIIiam. What wouId you do?

1356
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:42,098
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:34:42,276 --> 01:34:44,676
...have been with you
Iong enough to be disgruntIed?

1358
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:47,814
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:50,951
It's aImost a fucking feudaI enterprise.

1360
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:54,645
The question is,
and this is the onIy question...

1361
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:59,983
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:04,091
The onIy one
who couId do what I do is me.

1363
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:08,802
Lot of peopIe had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:13,330
You wanna be me?

1365
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:19,706
I probabIy couId be you. Yeah.

1366
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,370
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:35:22,683 --> 01:35:25,743
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:35:25,919 --> 01:35:28,183
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:34,126
''Heavy Iies the crown'' sort of thing.

1370
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:36,061
Yeah.

1371
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:39,365
-Francis.
-I'm out of here. You'II set the aIarm--

1372
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:43,629
-Yeah, aII right. I'II see you at Christmas.
-AII right. Good night.

1373
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:49,007
You know what I Iike about restaurants?

1374
01:35:49,176 --> 01:35:51,041
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:55,447
You Iearn a Iot watching things eat.

1376
01:35:57,685 --> 01:36:00,017
There's a boat coming up GIoucester.

1377
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:03,821
French wiII give you aII the detaiIs.
Don't forget.

1378
01:36:03,991 --> 01:36:07,154
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:36:11,331 --> 01:36:16,564
In the future, I teII you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:36:17,404 --> 01:36:19,668
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:23,600
Excuse me...

1382
01:36:23,777 --> 01:36:26,439
-...French, I forgot my...
-Okay, Francis.

1383
01:36:26,613 --> 01:36:27,602
...cigarette.

1384
01:36:30,584 --> 01:36:32,916
Eat something.

1385
01:36:41,562 --> 01:36:42,551
ProbIem?

1386
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:46,257
Yeah, I got a probIem. I run rat fucks
Iike you, okay? I don't Iike them.

1387
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:48,765
The day you wouIdn't take a promotion,
Iet me know.

1388
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:51,063
If you'd taken care of this
I wouIdn't be here.

1389
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:54,765
-Fuck yourseIf, you piece of shit.
-I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:36:54,942 --> 01:36:58,503
BIow me. Not IiteraIIy. UnfortunateIy,
there's no promotion invoIved for you.

1391
01:36:58,679 --> 01:36:59,668
Fucking prick.

1392
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,072
-Hi, captain.
-Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:05,582
-They are not happy with me.
-What do you expect?

1394
01:37:05,919 --> 01:37:09,252
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find CosteIIo's rat.

1395
01:37:10,023 --> 01:37:12,617
They want to find the Ieak
as much as you do.

1396
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:17,154
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who CosteIIo's rat is.

1397
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:21,800
-But he Iost him in the streets.
-ReaIIy?

1398
01:37:24,138 --> 01:37:27,403
-WeII, did he get a Iook at the guy?
-No.

1399
01:37:27,574 --> 01:37:30,338
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that couId heIp us.

1400
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,739
No.

1401
01:37:34,214 --> 01:37:37,115
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generaIIy.

1402
01:37:37,885 --> 01:37:41,582
CosteIIo can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:43,620
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:47,758
FoIIow CosteIIo. You'II find his rat.

1405
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:58,030
You're gonna be looking at my people...

1406
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:02,470
...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.

1407
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:07,444
Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.

1408
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:10,873
Let me get you a coffee.

1409
01:38:13,821 --> 01:38:17,052
If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...

1410
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:20,626
...if I did it fuII-time, Iaw schooI...

1411
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:23,389
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:26,598
If I wasn't a trooper.

1413
01:38:30,904 --> 01:38:33,737
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:36,704
Another city.

1415
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:39,276
Another city, huh?

1416
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:43,909
Yeah, weII, that wouId be a cIean sIate.

1417
01:38:44,451 --> 01:38:47,716
I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.

1418
01:38:50,057 --> 01:38:51,854
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:38:52,025 --> 01:38:56,485
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capabIe.

1420
01:38:57,798 --> 01:39:02,132
I'm fucking Irish. I'II deaI with something
being wrong for the rest of my Iife.

1421
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:14,745
It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.

1422
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,764
-Of course I know how to spot a cop.
-How's that?

1423
01:39:35,936 --> 01:39:38,962
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:39:39,139 --> 01:39:42,404
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:39:42,576 --> 01:39:43,565
Yeah.

1426
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:47,441
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:39:48,081 --> 01:39:50,914
-Okay.
-You get it now, do you?

1428
01:39:56,857 --> 01:39:58,825
-What about this guy?
-Cop.

1429
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:04,125
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:08,231
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:10,700
She's probabIy
the fucking poIice commissioner.

1432
01:40:22,215 --> 01:40:26,242
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:40:27,988 --> 01:40:32,618
-I thought I was on for this.
-I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:40:32,793 --> 01:40:36,991
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:40:37,764 --> 01:40:40,324
-Jimmy, bring a mop.
-Out the back.

1436
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:43,428
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:40:43,603 --> 01:40:45,901
-...and there's guys that don't.
-And a paiI.

1438
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:49,935
You're a cop.

1439
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:51,741
What?

1440
01:40:51,912 --> 01:40:54,039
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:40:55,082 --> 01:40:58,813
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-Iooking women are cops.

1442
01:41:00,253 --> 01:41:03,381
WeII, I'm going home, aII right?
He's pIaying with his new guys.

1443
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:05,491
-See you Iater, aII right?
-See you Iater.

1444
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:15,392
He's moving something with aII new guys.
A whoIe new crew.

1445
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:18,766
No, no, I can't teII you what or where.
It's probabIy disinformation.

1446
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:22,238
Just keep foIIowing him, aII right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:23,842
-Tomorrow.
-No, no, no. Today.

1448
01:41:24,011 --> 01:41:26,377
-You heard nothing about drugs?
-No.

1449
01:41:26,546 --> 01:41:30,004
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about GIoucester?

1450
01:41:30,183 --> 01:41:33,949
Not a thing. And I wouId have.
That information wouId have come to me.

1451
01:41:35,822 --> 01:41:37,449
It ain't BiII.

1452
01:41:37,624 --> 01:41:39,387
No way, he says.

1453
01:41:51,905 --> 01:41:54,271
FoIIow CosteIIo. You'II find his rat.

1454
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:55,965
Yeah, this is Sergeant SuIIivan.

1455
01:41:56,143 --> 01:42:00,546
I want constant surveiIIance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:42:01,581 --> 01:42:03,276
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:42:06,119 --> 01:42:10,055
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we foIIowing Captain Queenan?

1458
01:42:10,223 --> 01:42:12,123
To find out about the good CathoIic Iife?

1459
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:15,455
I have to foIIow every Iead,
however unIikeIy...

1460
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:19,395
...however fucking painfuI it might be
to your deIicate fucking sensibiIities.

1461
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:21,557
Who toId you I had deIicate sensibiIities?

1462
01:42:21,735 --> 01:42:25,262
-I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right.
-I have reason to beIieve...

1463
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:28,169
...that Captain Queenan is CosteIIo's rat.

1464
01:42:28,341 --> 01:42:30,639
So just foIIow him and don't get made.

1465
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:36,847
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,548
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:43:14,721 --> 01:43:16,689
Look down the car.

1468
01:43:18,091 --> 01:43:20,559
-You got me?
-Yeah, I gotcha.

1469
01:43:20,727 --> 01:43:22,592
Is there a reason you wouId have a taiI?

1470
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:24,495
No.

1471
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:28,966
-Because I think--
-BiIIy, I don't have a taiI.

1472
01:43:30,303 --> 01:43:33,932
Get off at the next stop, aII right?
South Station. You wait there 1 0 minutes.

1473
01:43:34,107 --> 01:43:36,371
South Station. Wait 1 0 minutes.

1474
01:44:12,312 --> 01:44:15,509
He just went into a buiIding
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:44:15,682 --> 01:44:18,207
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:22,389 --> 01:44:24,016
Yeah, he went up to the top fIoor.

1477
01:44:28,595 --> 01:44:31,257
BuiIding's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:36,065
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He--

1479
01:44:36,903 --> 01:44:38,393
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:44:38,572 --> 01:44:39,698
-What?
-I just saw him.

1481
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:42,398
He had bIood on his hands.
He's Iost his fucking mind.

1482
01:44:48,982 --> 01:44:51,416
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:55,021
He's not incIuding his reguIar guys.
But I'II teII you something.

1484
01:44:55,188 --> 01:44:58,715
Sooner or Iater he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kiII me.

1485
01:44:58,892 --> 01:45:01,224
-I know it. He's gonna fucking kiII me!
-AII right!

1486
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:11,037
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:45:11,204 --> 01:45:12,899
AII right, aII right. Listen to me.

1488
01:45:13,073 --> 01:45:15,871
I'm reaIIy sorry for your troubIe.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:45:16,042 --> 01:45:19,307
I'II get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'II get you out.

1490
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:21,438
Yeah?

1491
01:45:21,615 --> 01:45:24,311
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:26,816
-What about the FBI?
-They're compromised.

1493
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,420
-They're what?
-They're fucked.

1494
01:45:32,459 --> 01:45:33,619
-Yeah.
-Where are you?

1495
01:45:33,793 --> 01:45:36,091
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:45:36,563 --> 01:45:38,554
Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:

1497
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:41,326
The address is 31 4 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:45:41,501 --> 01:45:42,934
AII right, we'II see you there.

1499
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:44,698
-What?
-You were foIIowed.

1500
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:46,463
-By who?
-By CosteIIo's peopIe.

1501
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,073
-ImpossibIe.
-One of the cops...

1502
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:50,971
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:45:51,945 --> 01:45:53,469
Come on!

1504
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:02,588
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:06,523
Fucking shit. Looks Iike Queenan's
meeting with aII of them.

1506
01:46:07,427 --> 01:46:09,861
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:13,329
Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.

1508
01:46:18,271 --> 01:46:21,104
Ah, Christ, it's too Iate.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:26,975
-Shit!
-You got to get out of here!

1510
01:46:27,147 --> 01:46:28,978
-Take the fire escape.
-What about you?

1511
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:32,175
I'II be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:46:49,803 --> 01:46:52,363
-One of you mugs got a Iight?
-Where's your boy?

1513
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:55,565
-He's studying Iaw at Notre Dame.
-Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:57,835
-Hey! Hey!
-Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:46:58,011 --> 01:47:00,036
-Fucking kiII you!
-Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:19,355
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:47:23,703 --> 01:47:25,728
Sarge, something
just came off the buiIding.

1518
01:47:26,539 --> 01:47:28,598
What the fuck?

1519
01:47:31,678 --> 01:47:32,667
Fuck.

1520
01:47:32,846 --> 01:47:34,746
What do you mean,
off the buiIding?

1521
01:47:34,914 --> 01:47:37,610
-Something came off the fucking roof.
-It's a fucking body.

1522
01:47:46,326 --> 01:47:48,226
We can't get a visuaI.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:51,159
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:47:51,765 --> 01:47:53,255
-Where were you?
-What happened?

1525
01:47:53,433 --> 01:47:55,230
You're fucking Iate! Get in the van!

1526
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:56,767
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:47:56,936 --> 01:47:58,597
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:47:58,772 --> 01:48:00,296
-What the fuck--?
-Get in the van!

1529
01:48:00,473 --> 01:48:03,408
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:48:03,576 --> 01:48:05,635
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:48:05,812 --> 01:48:07,939
-Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
-I need information.

1532
01:48:08,114 --> 01:48:09,479
What came off the roof?

1533
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:11,139
-No pursuit.
-That's buIIshit.

1534
01:48:11,317 --> 01:48:13,080
Fuck this.

1535
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:22,788
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:48:24,297 --> 01:48:27,232
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,027
AII right. I got him.

1538
01:48:35,475 --> 01:48:37,670
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:41,245
An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!

1540
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:43,439
Send some back--

1541
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,963
So do you know
why Queenan went into that buiIding?

1542
01:49:04,137 --> 01:49:05,968
-No.
-WeII, a better question...

1543
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:08,300
...is why the fuck
were your guys foIIowing him?

1544
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:11,205
I toId InternaI Investigations
to foIIow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:49:11,377 --> 01:49:13,777
-Why?
-That's InternaI Investigations' business.

1546
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:16,342
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:49:16,516 --> 01:49:18,006
-AII right.
-Hey, hey!

1548
01:49:18,184 --> 01:49:19,549
-Fucking bitch!
-Let him go!

1549
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:22,882
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking expIain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:49:23,056 --> 01:49:25,217
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:49:25,391 --> 01:49:27,621
-Come on!
-I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:49:27,794 --> 01:49:31,195
I got reason to beIieve that Queenan
got kiIIed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:49:31,364 --> 01:49:32,456
That's a fucking Iie.

1554
01:49:32,632 --> 01:49:36,193
He has fucking information
in a Iocked fiIe, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:37,961
I need access to those fiIes.

1556
01:49:38,137 --> 01:49:41,163
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'II give it to you.

1557
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:43,468
-That's a fucking Iie.
-Nobody caIIs me a Iiar!

1558
01:49:43,643 --> 01:49:46,441
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unIock those fiIes.

1559
01:49:46,613 --> 01:49:49,480
-Dignam, take a Ieave of absence.
-Take a Ieave of what?

1560
01:49:49,649 --> 01:49:52,584
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:55,118
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:49:55,288 --> 01:49:58,689
WorId needs pIenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:49:58,858 --> 01:50:00,325
Good.

1564
01:50:02,161 --> 01:50:03,753
-Piece of shit.
-Fuck off.

1565
01:50:05,698 --> 01:50:07,529
-I need those codes.
-No.

1566
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:09,827
You want those codes.

1567
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:14,668
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:50:16,342 --> 01:50:18,902
WeII, boss toId me to go home.

1569
01:50:19,078 --> 01:50:23,276
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1570
01:50:23,449 --> 01:50:24,916
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:50:25,518 --> 01:50:28,419
I was at the grocery store
with no signaI, aII right?

1572
01:50:28,588 --> 01:50:30,579
When I got the signaI, I got the caII.

1573
01:50:30,757 --> 01:50:33,783
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:36,019
BiIIy. BiIIy.

1575
01:50:42,402 --> 01:50:43,926
Yeah?

1576
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:48,130
Yeah?

1577
01:50:48,608 --> 01:50:50,769
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:50:52,579 --> 01:50:54,274
What's that?

1579
01:50:55,281 --> 01:50:58,739
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:51:02,221 --> 01:51:03,586
Yeah?

1581
01:51:04,624 --> 01:51:08,424
-So?
-And you never been Iate in your Iife.

1582
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,560
When I caIIed you...

1583
01:51:12,732 --> 01:51:14,962
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:51:15,134 --> 01:51:18,934
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:51:19,105 --> 01:51:22,939
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:51:23,409 --> 01:51:25,309
...didn't you?

1587
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:29,139
TeII me why I didn't teII nobody, huh?

1588
01:51:30,416 --> 01:51:31,747
TeII me why.

1589
01:51:54,641 --> 01:51:58,042
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:51:58,211 --> 01:52:00,008
He's dead.

1591
01:52:00,179 --> 01:52:01,806
I'm going home.

1592
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:04,779
-Your guys shouId not have done that.
-One of us had to die.

1593
01:52:04,951 --> 01:52:06,976
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:52:07,153 --> 01:52:08,620
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:52:08,788 --> 01:52:11,985
You kiIIed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:52:12,158 --> 01:52:14,820
-He resigned.
-I don't give a fuck about Dignam.

1597
01:52:14,994 --> 01:52:16,461
He put in his papers, Frank.

1598
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:20,690
-He Ieft. I don't know where he is.
-Don't get your baIIs in an uproar, CoIIie.

1599
01:52:20,867 --> 01:52:22,300
That Irish pissant...

1600
01:52:22,468 --> 01:52:26,131
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'II crawI right in it.

1601
01:52:26,305 --> 01:52:28,364
Let's give him a whiff.

1602
01:52:28,541 --> 01:52:32,204
-I wiII.
-Don't worry. I'II take care of it.

1603
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,541
Sweetheart.

1604
01:52:35,715 --> 01:52:37,910
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:52:38,518 --> 01:52:39,917
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:43,685
Not aII that taIk
about whiffing and crawIing up asses?

1607
01:52:44,157 --> 01:52:46,148
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:52:46,325 --> 01:52:48,759
No. You watch it.

1609
01:52:49,462 --> 01:52:51,760
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:52:59,672 --> 01:53:02,539
I tried to caII you a few times.

1611
01:53:05,745 --> 01:53:07,508
I know.

1612
01:53:33,906 --> 01:53:37,808
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:44,849
I'm sorry.

1614
01:53:51,324 --> 01:53:53,053
Yeah...

1615
01:53:57,630 --> 01:53:59,257
...I know.

1616
01:56:07,894 --> 01:56:09,384
Yeah.

1617
01:56:10,196 --> 01:56:13,427
You caIIed this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:56:13,866 --> 01:56:15,424
Who are you?

1619
01:56:15,668 --> 01:56:17,932
So it is you.

1620
01:56:19,138 --> 01:56:22,130
WeII, thank God you're aII right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:56:23,542 --> 01:56:25,169
Who are you?

1622
01:56:26,078 --> 01:56:28,103
This is Sergeant SuIIivan.

1623
01:56:28,281 --> 01:56:30,044
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1624
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:32,775
Let me taIk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:56:32,952 --> 01:56:34,283
Staff Sergeant Dignam...

1626
01:56:34,453 --> 01:56:37,650
...is on a Ieave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:56:37,823 --> 01:56:40,018
We're aII very upset.

1628
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:43,424
I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.

1629
01:56:44,397 --> 01:56:47,298
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,757
We'll meet--

1631
01:57:28,941 --> 01:57:31,239
Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...

1632
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:33,378
...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...

1633
01:57:33,546 --> 01:57:36,538
...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...

1634
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:39,207
...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...

1635
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:42,354
...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.

1636
01:57:42,521 --> 01:57:44,079
As for who did this or why...

1637
01:57:44,256 --> 01:57:46,656
...that's something police
are working on right now.

1638
01:57:46,826 --> 01:57:50,284
-I don't beIieve it.
-What can't you beIieve?

1639
01:57:50,529 --> 01:57:53,987
I spent aII fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:57:54,166 --> 01:57:56,100
TeII me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:57:56,268 --> 01:57:58,896
Somebody waIking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:57:59,071 --> 01:58:01,232
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:58:01,407 --> 01:58:03,534
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:58:03,709 --> 01:58:05,939
I spent aII fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:58:06,312 --> 01:58:07,609
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,942
I stiII don't beIieve he was a cop.
I don't beIieve it.

1647
01:58:11,117 --> 01:58:15,645
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:58:16,022 --> 01:58:18,217
...so I won't Iook for the cop.

1649
01:58:19,492 --> 01:58:21,119
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:58:21,293 --> 01:58:26,253
When I teII you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:58:26,432 --> 01:58:29,367
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:58:30,403 --> 01:58:33,702
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:58:33,873 --> 01:58:35,966
...to get a fucking bIowjob!

1654
01:58:36,742 --> 01:58:38,903
Don't Iaugh!

1655
01:58:39,745 --> 01:58:42,646
This ain't reaIity TV!

1656
01:58:46,585 --> 01:58:48,348
Proceed.

1657
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:12,277
-What?
-Yeah.

1658
01:59:12,445 --> 01:59:15,209
You got a taiI. Two cars.
Not very subtIe.

1659
01:59:15,381 --> 01:59:18,942
They're not gonna be subtIe from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:20,244
So get rid of them.

1661
01:59:20,419 --> 01:59:23,513
There's no need for you
to go yourseIf, Frank.

1662
01:59:23,689 --> 01:59:25,919
Get rid of the fucking taiI!

1663
01:59:30,863 --> 01:59:32,421
AII right.

1664
01:59:38,737 --> 01:59:41,934
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:59:42,108 --> 01:59:44,906
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
02:00:01,227 --> 02:00:04,560
Stop, stop. PuII them off CosteIIo.
There's no need to surveiI him.

1667
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:07,096
-What are you saying?
-I got it from an undercover.

1668
02:00:07,266 --> 02:00:09,928
He knows he's being foIIowed.
So Iet the UC take him in.

1669
02:00:10,136 --> 02:00:11,501
-Undercover?
-Queenan's guy.

1670
02:00:11,670 --> 02:00:14,332
He caIIed when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
02:00:14,507 --> 02:00:17,442
-You give him to me.
-No, I can give you CosteIIo's destination.

1672
02:00:17,643 --> 02:00:20,111
-You know where he's going?
-Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:22,440
Get rid of the taiI,
get SpeciaI Ops on standby.

1674
02:00:22,615 --> 02:00:25,049
-We'II take this prick tonight.
-Let's go. Now.

1675
02:00:25,217 --> 02:00:28,209
AII units faII back.
AII units faII back.

1676
02:00:48,574 --> 02:00:50,633
It's the warehouse he owns
over on SheffieId.

1677
02:00:50,809 --> 02:00:53,403
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
02:01:17,703 --> 02:01:19,227
Load it.

1679
02:01:27,246 --> 02:01:29,544
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a taiI, huh?

1680
02:01:30,816 --> 02:01:32,784
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
02:01:32,952 --> 02:01:36,012
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
02:01:39,225 --> 02:01:41,022
Load.

1683
02:01:48,601 --> 02:01:50,432
Go, go!

1684
02:01:52,871 --> 02:01:54,429
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
02:01:56,508 --> 02:01:58,635
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
02:01:58,811 --> 02:02:02,269
-Watch your fucking back.
-Move out! Go on!

1687
02:02:11,290 --> 02:02:13,724
Cocksuckers.

1688
02:02:19,732 --> 02:02:22,292
Motherfucking shit!

1689
02:02:25,738 --> 02:02:27,399
Motherfucking...!

1690
02:02:30,809 --> 02:02:33,073
Back the fuck up!

1691
02:02:33,245 --> 02:02:35,338
They fucking shot me.

1692
02:02:39,051 --> 02:02:40,177
Get down!

1693
02:02:43,188 --> 02:02:44,746
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
02:03:03,475 --> 02:03:04,942
Fuck it.

1695
02:03:44,383 --> 02:03:48,149
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
02:03:49,555 --> 02:03:52,149
You're an FBI informant?

1697
02:03:52,324 --> 02:03:54,519
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
02:03:55,994 --> 02:03:57,689
Grow up.

1699
02:03:58,397 --> 02:04:01,332
Of course I taIk to the FBI.

1700
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:02,990
Do they know who I am?

1701
02:04:04,937 --> 02:04:09,306
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1702
02:04:10,342 --> 02:04:12,776
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:15,870
Frank.

1704
02:04:16,181 --> 02:04:19,082
Frank. Frank.

1705
02:04:19,251 --> 02:04:21,242
Do they know about me?

1706
02:04:22,955 --> 02:04:25,480
I know about you, CoIIie.

1707
02:04:25,657 --> 02:04:28,490
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
02:04:29,228 --> 02:04:31,992
-You're Iike a--
-What? Like a son?

1709
02:04:32,898 --> 02:04:36,265
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
02:04:37,236 --> 02:04:41,570
AII that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
02:05:03,595 --> 02:05:06,029
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:05:27,619 --> 02:05:29,211
Frank?

1713
02:05:29,388 --> 02:05:30,878
Yeah?

1714
02:05:32,624 --> 02:05:33,852
Who's this?

1715
02:05:35,761 --> 02:05:37,388
Gwen?

1716
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:40,623
Where the heII's Frank?

1717
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:43,497
Frank got shot.

1718
02:05:46,338 --> 02:05:48,738
Gwen, we Iost Frank.

1719
02:05:57,115 --> 02:05:58,742
I got him!

1720
02:05:58,917 --> 02:06:01,351
I got CosteIIo here!

1721
02:06:05,491 --> 02:06:07,982
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,318
No, it's....

1723
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:13,322
For you.

1724
02:06:14,399 --> 02:06:17,459
-Thank you.
-No. Thank you.

1725
02:06:20,973 --> 02:06:24,204
He's been waiting here
a Iong time for you.

1726
02:06:24,409 --> 02:06:26,843
How'd you get him without the fiIes?

1727
02:06:27,012 --> 02:06:29,810
CaIIer ID on Queenan's phone.

1728
02:06:30,782 --> 02:06:32,147
You know that guy?

1729
02:06:32,317 --> 02:06:35,184
Yeah. We were cIassmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:06:42,628 --> 02:06:44,289
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:06:44,463 --> 02:06:47,125
-Yeah.
-CoIin SuIIivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:06:47,299 --> 02:06:48,857
-Yeah.
-So.

1733
02:06:50,402 --> 02:06:52,165
Now, how Iong were you undercover?

1734
02:06:52,337 --> 02:06:54,237
Long time.

1735
02:06:54,406 --> 02:06:56,237
-Long fucking time.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:06:56,642 --> 02:07:01,579
WeII, I can't even teII you the debt....

1737
02:07:04,416 --> 02:07:07,749
I just want you to know I'II be
recommending you for the MedaI of Merit.

1738
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:09,615
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1739
02:07:10,556 --> 02:07:12,922
That's kind of Iike a goId star
around here, huh?

1740
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,757
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:07:16,929 --> 02:07:19,727
Look, I just want
my identity back, aII right?

1742
02:07:19,898 --> 02:07:21,889
-That's aII.
-AII right.

1743
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:24,968
-I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
-No, no.

1744
02:07:25,137 --> 02:07:28,732
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:07:29,007 --> 02:07:31,976
Check your computer. Go on.
You'II have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:07:32,144 --> 02:07:36,103
My onIy contact in the Iast six months
has been a poIice shrink.

1747
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:41,048
How's that working for you?

1748
02:07:41,219 --> 02:07:42,948
Is it heIpfuI?

1749
02:07:43,689 --> 02:07:46,453
What are you gonna do
about CosteIIo's rat in this buiIding?

1750
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:52,292
-I'm gonna find the prick.
-Yeah.

1751
02:07:52,731 --> 02:07:55,427
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:58,764
-Good.
-Anything you can do to heIp me....

1753
02:07:58,937 --> 02:08:02,771
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name--? You know, anything.

1754
02:08:02,941 --> 02:08:05,535
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:08:05,711 --> 02:08:08,271
I'm aII done being a cop, aII right?

1756
02:08:08,447 --> 02:08:10,608
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:08:10,782 --> 02:08:13,182
AII right. That'II be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:08:13,352 --> 02:08:14,751
Fair enough.

1759
02:08:15,354 --> 02:08:19,814
I just, I can't get into your fiIe
unIess I have your password.

1760
02:08:21,994 --> 02:08:23,018
It's my name.

1761
02:08:23,829 --> 02:08:26,195
WiIIiam Costigan Jr.

1762
02:08:26,365 --> 02:08:29,630
They gave it to me in case I had to
expIain myseIf to someone Iike you.

1763
02:08:30,202 --> 02:08:32,136
It's your name.

1764
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:35,638
AII right.

1765
02:08:35,807 --> 02:08:38,503
Fucking unreaI, that--
WeII, makes a Iot of sense.

1766
02:08:38,677 --> 02:08:40,907
Listen, BiII, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:08:41,079 --> 02:08:43,343
This computer's getting
aII frigging bIooey on me.

1768
02:08:43,515 --> 02:08:47,281
Give me two minutes. I'II have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:10:20,612 --> 02:10:24,446
AII right, everything checks out,
so Iet's get you paid.

1770
02:10:55,413 --> 02:10:57,176
I know.

1771
02:10:58,717 --> 02:11:01,208
I know. I'm not--
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:11:01,486 --> 02:11:03,078
I'm not.

1773
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:08,555
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:11:08,727 --> 02:11:11,161
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:11:11,329 --> 02:11:12,921
For me.

1776
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:16,792
Okay?

1777
02:11:20,405 --> 02:11:24,705
-What is it?
-This is for you to hoId. OnIy you.

1778
02:11:24,876 --> 02:11:28,835
You open this if something happens to me
or if I caII you and I teII you to open it.

1779
02:11:29,014 --> 02:11:31,574
You're the onIy person
I can trust, aII right?

1780
02:11:33,185 --> 02:11:34,777
PIease.

1781
02:11:38,323 --> 02:11:40,723
-AII right.
-Look, I'm sorry to even--

1782
02:11:40,892 --> 02:11:43,588
I'm sorry to even show up here
Iike this, you know?

1783
02:11:43,762 --> 02:11:47,027
I-- There's just no one eIse
I couId give it to.

1784
02:11:48,466 --> 02:11:50,627
There's no one eIse.

1785
02:11:51,403 --> 02:11:54,133
-I'm reaIIy sorry.
-I....

1786
02:11:54,739 --> 02:11:56,707
You know, I have....

1787
02:11:56,875 --> 02:11:59,309
-I....
-Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:11:59,477 --> 02:12:01,672
...think about it reaI hard, aII right?

1789
02:12:01,847 --> 02:12:05,374
If you stiII wanna teII me,
you teII me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:12:35,146 --> 02:12:37,080
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:42,648
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:12:43,588 --> 02:12:46,819
-What's this?
-Open it.

1793
02:12:55,667 --> 02:12:58,329
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

1794
02:12:59,371 --> 02:13:00,838
ReaIIy?

1795
02:13:01,506 --> 02:13:03,030
Yeah.

1796
02:13:03,208 --> 02:13:06,769
And they say
that this IittIe speck...

1797
02:13:06,945 --> 02:13:09,140
...is a penis.

1798
02:13:12,417 --> 02:13:14,282
It's a boy.

1799
02:13:14,452 --> 02:13:17,250
Yeah, weII,
one usuaIIy foIIows the other.

1800
02:13:18,757 --> 02:13:20,748
Can you stiII...?

1801
02:14:11,309 --> 02:14:13,300
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1802
02:14:13,478 --> 02:14:17,676
...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1803
02:14:17,849 --> 02:14:21,512
...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.

1804
02:14:21,686 --> 02:14:24,519
Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?

1805
02:14:24,689 --> 02:14:29,991
Would I--? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?

1806
02:14:30,161 --> 02:14:33,358
Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.

1807
02:14:33,531 --> 02:14:35,897
You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.

1808
02:14:36,067 --> 02:14:39,468
Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.

1809
02:14:39,637 --> 02:14:43,505
Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1810
02:14:47,178 --> 02:14:48,736
What?

1811
02:14:52,350 --> 02:14:53,840
What?

1812
02:14:56,154 --> 02:14:58,452
-We got a cop in my crew.
-Yeah, I know.

1813
02:14:58,623 --> 02:15:02,582
-I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
-He's one of yours. Inside.

1814
02:15:02,761 --> 02:15:04,092
-You seen anything?
-Frank.

1815
02:15:04,262 --> 02:15:07,857
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1816
02:15:08,033 --> 02:15:12,595
-I'm doing my--
-You know what, I thought I was the Iiar.

1817
02:15:12,771 --> 02:15:15,706
Hey, I can expIain that!

1818
02:15:20,879 --> 02:15:22,904
CosteIIo recorded everything.

1819
02:15:23,081 --> 02:15:27,643
He put aII the tapes in a box and kept them
with his Iawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:15:27,819 --> 02:15:29,309
His Iawyer came to me.

1821
02:15:29,487 --> 02:15:31,250
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:15:31,423 --> 02:15:33,414
Costello trusted me more than anyone.

1823
02:15:34,092 --> 02:15:37,289
Sound quaIity good enough?
Because I was a IittIe worried.

1824
02:15:37,796 --> 02:15:40,390
-What do you want?
-I toId you I want my identity back...

1825
02:15:40,565 --> 02:15:42,590
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:15:42,901 --> 02:15:46,735
-AII right, where are you?
-Three o'cIock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:15:46,905 --> 02:15:48,839
You keep your ceII on.

1828
02:16:00,952 --> 02:16:02,715
Open the door.

1829
02:16:06,724 --> 02:16:10,717
Open-- Didn't we aIready taIk about this?

1830
02:16:11,896 --> 02:16:14,057
This is my job.

1831
02:16:39,324 --> 02:16:41,315
-Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
-Hey!

1832
02:16:41,493 --> 02:16:43,017
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:16:43,194 --> 02:16:46,425
Put the gun down, aII right?
I came here to taIk some sense into you.

1834
02:16:46,598 --> 02:16:48,156
-Hands!
-Just act professionaI.

1835
02:16:48,333 --> 02:16:50,358
-I can get you your money.
-What did you say?

1836
02:16:50,535 --> 02:16:54,130
-I can get you your money.
-You didn't come here to taIk, aII right?

1837
02:16:54,305 --> 02:16:57,274
-You came here to get arrested.
-You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:16:57,442 --> 02:17:00,934
CosteIIo was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:17:01,112 --> 02:17:03,103
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:17:03,281 --> 02:17:05,146
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:17:05,316 --> 02:17:07,716
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
BIow me, aII right?

1842
02:17:07,886 --> 02:17:10,719
OnIy one of us is a cop here, BiII.
You understand that, BiII?

1843
02:17:10,889 --> 02:17:12,789
-No one knows you.
-Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:17:12,957 --> 02:17:16,222
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State PoIice. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:17:16,394 --> 02:17:19,522
-I erased you!
-You erased me, huh?

1846
02:17:19,697 --> 02:17:22,359
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:17:22,534 --> 02:17:25,002
This buIIet wouId
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:17:25,170 --> 02:17:27,866
-Watch what happens!
-What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:17:28,039 --> 02:17:32,499
The bagpipes and buIIshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:17:32,677 --> 02:17:35,441
-That's the stupidest thing you couId do.
-Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:17:38,183 --> 02:17:40,413
I couId give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:17:40,585 --> 02:17:42,280
I'm stiII fucking arresting you.

1853
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:44,620
Get up.

1854
02:17:45,790 --> 02:17:48,816
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant SuIIivan.

1855
02:17:48,993 --> 02:17:51,518
I caIIed you. You specificaIIy. Look:

1856
02:17:51,696 --> 02:17:55,063
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I toId you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:17:55,233 --> 02:17:58,202
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant SuIIivan!

1858
02:17:58,369 --> 02:18:00,496
Where's Dignam?
I toId you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:18:00,672 --> 02:18:02,902
Shoot this motherfucker!
WouId you fucking shoot!

1860
02:18:03,074 --> 02:18:06,771
-Drop your weapon. We'II discuss it.
-Look, he's CosteIIo's rat, aII right?

1861
02:18:06,945 --> 02:18:11,609
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:18:14,018 --> 02:18:15,952
Maybe you do.

1863
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:18,247
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:18:18,423 --> 02:18:21,392
I have evidence coId-Iinking
this prick to CosteIIo, aII right?

1865
02:18:21,559 --> 02:18:24,528
-WouId you shoot this fucking prick!
-You know who I am.

1866
02:18:24,696 --> 02:18:26,789
-You know who I am.
-Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:18:26,965 --> 02:18:29,160
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:18:32,470 --> 02:18:34,301
You know who I am.

1869
02:18:59,430 --> 02:19:01,295
Shut up.

1870
02:19:02,333 --> 02:19:05,359
I can't wait to see you expIain this
to a SuffoIk County jury...

1871
02:19:05,536 --> 02:19:06,730
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:19:06,904 --> 02:19:09,429
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:19:20,585 --> 02:19:22,883
Just fucking kiII me.

1874
02:19:24,489 --> 02:19:26,650
Just fucking kiII me.

1875
02:19:28,926 --> 02:19:30,985
I am kiIIing you.

1876
02:20:07,198 --> 02:20:09,928
Did you think you were the onIy one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:20:10,168 --> 02:20:12,466
CosteIIo was gonna seII us to the FBI.

1878
02:20:12,637 --> 02:20:14,332
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:20:14,505 --> 02:20:17,372
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:20:30,988 --> 02:20:32,580
Give me that.

1881
02:20:48,005 --> 02:20:51,372
Right. Slow. March.

1882
02:20:59,584 --> 02:21:01,779
I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...

1883
02:21:01,953 --> 02:21:06,481
...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...

1884
02:21:06,657 --> 02:21:08,818
...and strike him in the head.

1885
02:21:08,993 --> 02:21:11,427
At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...

1886
02:21:11,596 --> 02:21:13,791
...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...

1887
02:21:13,965 --> 02:21:17,128
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:21:20,304 --> 02:21:22,568
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:21:23,307 --> 02:21:27,266
I'm recommending WiIIiam Costigan
for the MedaI of Merit.

1890
02:21:38,256 --> 02:21:40,588
-EternaI rest grant unto him, O Lord.
-Ready?

1891
02:21:40,758 --> 02:21:43,659
-And Iet perpetuaI Iight shine upon him.
-FoId.

1892
02:21:43,828 --> 02:21:46,626
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:21:46,798 --> 02:21:49,130
May his souI and the souIs...

1894
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:54,135
...of aII the faithfuI departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:21:54,305 --> 02:21:55,897
Amen.

1896
02:22:25,336 --> 02:22:27,566
DetaiI. HaIf Ieft. Face.

1897
02:22:28,940 --> 02:22:30,931
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:22:31,175 --> 02:22:32,802
Fire.

1899
02:22:32,977 --> 02:22:35,468
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:39,406
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:39,851 --> 02:22:43,150
DetaiI. HaIf right. Face.

1902
02:22:56,567 --> 02:22:58,933
I'II catch up with you guys.

1903
02:23:06,210 --> 02:23:08,041
What about the baby?

1904
02:23:25,763 --> 02:23:27,390
Hi, pup.

1905
02:23:58,930 --> 02:24:00,557
Okay.
