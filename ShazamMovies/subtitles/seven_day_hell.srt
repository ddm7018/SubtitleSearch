<i>And here we go.</i>

4
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:20,417
<i>Aaron Williams, one point away from
ending this outrageous seven-day match.</i>

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,403
<i>On this, his 67th match point.</i>

6
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:26,727
<i>He can end it all with one serve.</i>

7
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:32,936
<i>Oh.
A weak 30-mph serve into the net.</i>

8
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:36,847
<i>Seven days of play really taking
its toll on everyone here.</i>

9
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:40,218
<i>Please end it.
Please end it.</i>

10
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:44,204
Fuck, no.

11
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,420
- Jesus.
- Oh, this is killing me.

12
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:49,868
The Williams-Poole match.

13
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:53,018
It wasn't even a match. It was...
It was something else.

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,167
It was two men stuck in eternal flames.

15
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,402
<i>- Deuce.</i>
- Yeah, I know it's deuce.

16
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:02,173
We all know it's deuce, man.

17
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,602
It was...
seven days in hell.

<i>It was the most spectacular
match in tennis history.</i>

20
00:01:16,847 --> 00:01:19,781
<i>But to fully understand
how these two men got here,</i>

21
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,448
<i>we must first know where they came from.</i>

22
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:29,951
Aaron Williams, thank you
for sitting down with us.

23
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:32,754
- My pleasure.
- You're known as the "bad boy" of tennis.

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,746
No. You know what?
Fuck this and fuck you.

25
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:40,603
<i>Aaron Williams does not play "country club"
tennis because he's from the streets.</i>

26
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,639
I mean, literally.
He was left on a street by his mother

27
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:46,051
and then was adopted by Richard Williams,

28
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:47,728
<i>father of Serena and Venus.</i>

29
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:51,019
Well, with Aaron
it was a reverse "Blind Side."

30
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:55,135
You know, a rich white family gets a
black kid and makes him play football.

31
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,486
Well, we flipped it.

32
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:59,533
<i>My dad, he took a white kid
and made him play tennis.</i>

33
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:03,182
<i>Like his sisters, Aaron quickly
rose to the top of the game.</i>

34
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,768
<i>But the number-one ranking eluded him.</i>

35
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,706
<i>His personal life, however,</i>

36
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:10,013
<i>has shined bright since his arrival to fame.</i>

37
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,907
<i>We could go months without talking to him.</i>

38
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:16,579
He'd hang around a lot in Vegas, spending a lot
of time with Rod Stewart and some magician.

39
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:21,841
Well, it was me, Aaron Williams and Rod Stewart
going out every night for about 10 years,

40
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:23,992
crushing pussy and making money.

41
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:27,295
_

42
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:30,513
<i>Aaron's chance to become the
top-ranked player in the world</i>

43
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:33,313
<i>finally came at the '96 Wimbledon finals.</i>

44
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:35,516
<i>What happened at Wimbledon '96</i>

45
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:38,663
completely changed the trajectory
of Aaron Williams' life.

46
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,741
<i>Will he do it? At 25 years old
finally win Wimbledon and grab</i>

47
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:45,474
<i>that number-one ranking he so desires?</i>

48
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:48,914
<i>Can he do it?
Can he beat the Belgian, Jens Goossens?</i>

49
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:52,936
<i>Ace.</i>

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,599
<i>- Three points away now.
- Here comes the guitar.</i>

51
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:59,025
<i>He is gunning for that title.</i>

52
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:01,116
<i>- 30-love.
- Another ace.</i>

53
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,364
<i>Are you kidding me?
148 miles per hour.</i>

54
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,567
<i>He's like, on another planet right now.</i>

55
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:12,518
After those three aces,
there wasn't one person

56
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:14,635
who didn't think that
a four-bagger was coming.

57
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,269
And with it, a new tennis champion.

58
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:21,078
<i>But what came next was
something quite different.</i>

59
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,627
<i>Here we go.
Championship point.</i>

60
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,995
<i>It appears he just whispered to himself,</i>

61
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,650
<i>"This is how we do it."</i>

62
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:34,534
<i>The hit Montell Jordan song that Aaron
sung backup vocals on this year.</i>

63
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:39,512
<i>Oh!
Oh, jeez.</i>

64
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:42,718
<i>This is not good.</i>

65
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:45,099
<i>We just hope he's all right.</i>

66
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:47,865
You knew right away he was dead.

67
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,723
<i>My Lord, I've never seen anything like this.</i>

68
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:55,159
<i>It was one of the great
tragedies of all time</i>

69
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:57,935
and, technically,
it wasn't the impact that killed him.

70
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:01,175
But the impact gave him a heart
attack and that killed him.

71
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:03,477
<i>So if you ask me, did Aaron kill him?</i>

72
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,044
I'd say kinda.

73
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,383
The silver lining to that man's death

74
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:12,118
is that Aaron had set a...
a new speed record <i>for a serve.</i>

75
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,569
<i>If the pressure of winning
Wimbledon wasn't enough,</i>

76
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,889
<i>now he's got a dead body on his hands.</i>

77
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:21,286
<i>Aaron probably should have
forfeited after killing a guy.</i>

78
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:23,709
But he didn't because he's an asshole.

79
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,696
<i>Second serve now, after killing a man.</i>

80
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,588
_

81
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:33,382
<i>Not a good sign for Williams.</i>

82
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,543
<i>Aaron lost, but remarkably,</i>

83
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:44,566
<i>killing a man and losing his
greatest shot at Wimbledon</i>

84
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,637
<i>and the number-one ranking still wasn't
as low as he would sink that day.</i>

85
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:52,369
<i>Let us start with a moment of silence</i>

86
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:56,007
for Chauncey Kensington,

87
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:59,163
who gave his life for the game of tennis.

88
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,379
And now let's hear it for the runner-up,

89
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:10,266
Aaron Williams.

90
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,487
Thanks.

91
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:18,980
Man, sorry I couldn't win today.
I thought I was gonna, but...

92
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,259
_

93
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:22,478
I didn't murder him.
He had a heart attack.

94
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,370
Great. Well, you know what?
I hate all of you too.

95
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,230
I hate this stupid-ass country.

96
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,879
The food's terrible.
There's no hot chicks.

97
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:34,949
I've seen maybe two, max,
and they were, like, "sixes" at best.

98
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:36,932
Even then, they'd be way lower

99
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:38,644
if you put them in an L.A. or Miami

100
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:41,175
or even a San Francisco!
<i>- This is an outrage...</i>

101
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,637
Get out of my fucking way!

102
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:44,058
He pushed the duke.

103
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:48,432
You don't shove a member of the royal family
unless your brain is made of toddings.

104
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,367
Sorry for my language.

105
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,485
<i>It was the push heard round the world.</i>

106
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:03,480
The Duke of Kent has been pushed.

107
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,406
_

108
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,521
_

109
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:10,663
Later, tennis.

110
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:12,733
<i>I mean, no one actually thought</i>

111
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:15,093
he was saying goodbye to tennis for good,
because

112
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:17,497
that's a crazy thing to say when retiring.

113
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,252
"Later, tennis"?

114
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:21,889
<i>After this dramatic exit, he vanished.</i>

115
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:26,098
<i>And it seemed that would be the last
anyone would hear from Aaron Williams.</i>

116
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:29,786
<i>No one could know that he would return</i>

117
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:33,497
<i>to compete in the longest and arguably
greatest game in tennis history.</i>

118
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:36,105
<i>Fuck, no!</i>

119
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:40,293
<i>His competitor in the
match was Charles Poole.</i>

120
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,216
<i>When you're a child prodigy,
the cameras start filming early.</i>

121
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,038
<i>His name is Charles Lloyd Poole,</i>

122
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,185
<i>and at three years of age, he's
only got the entire tennis world talking.</i>

123
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:55,014
You've got to be the best, Charles.
The best.

124
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:57,865
Mummy won't love you if you're second best.

125
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,497
<i>He's clearly one to watch.</i>
-

126
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,689
<i>If you like tennis,</i>

127
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:06,081
you will certainly like my next guest.

128
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:11,783
It is the<i> wunderkind,</i> Charles Lloyd Poole.

129
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:19,603
Welcome to "Good Sport."

130
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:23,951
The rooftops of London have been a-flutter

131
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:27,047
with talk that you may be turning pro

132
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:30,793
- before turning 16.
- Indubitably.

133
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,632
It would make you
the youngest pro in history.

134
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,490
Oh, yeah, indubitably.

135
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:38,773
<i>It was pretty obvious
someone had taught this kid</i>

136
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:40,576
the word, "indubitably,"

137
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:43,113
<i>thinking that mixed with his English accent,</i>

138
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,846
<i>it'd make him sound smart.</i>

139
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:49,014
Charles was by far the
thickest person I ever met.

140
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:52,675
<i>It was like talking to a
child with brain damage.</i>

141
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:57,187
His mother wanted him to turn pro so badly
that she found a shortcut for schooling.

142
00:07:57,324 --> 00:08:01,543
<i>She sent him to a vocation school that
taught him to be a bloody lorry driver.</i>

143
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,473
I must say, you are looking extremely fit.

144
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:08,380
Would you mind lifting...
Lifting your shirt so...

145
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,336
So we can inspect the abdominal muscles?

146
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,939
Oh, yeah, indubitably.

147
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:18,120
It was also obvious the host of "Good Sport"
was interested in him sexually.

148
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:30,689
I'm not entirely sure that camera

149
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,644
<i>got that.</i>

150
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,655
Crackerjack.

151
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,283
Well, Caspian Wint could be a bit
of a rapscallion.

152
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:42,187
That guy was a creep.
Nobody liked him.

153
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:44,046
Why do you smell like fire?

154
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:47,009
Because I rage inside, like a furnace.

155
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:52,448
And d-do you have a g... a girlfriend?

156
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,919
No, but I did have one once.

157
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:59,470
He was always really sweet and properly fit.

158
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,878
And I know he really did love me.

159
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:05,076
But, you know, my modeling
career was just pff-ff!

160
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:10,907
Besides, even if I had wanted more,
there was just no getting past his mum.

161
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,452
<i>She was an iron fortress around him.</i>

162
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:16,991
Are you scared of your mother?

163
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:20,514
No. No, of course not.
I... I love my mum.

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,467
I'm not scared of her.
I'm not scared of my mum at all.

165
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,880
Charles... is your mother

166
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:30,158
using you for her

167
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,419
own dashed dreams?

168
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:36,124
- Oh yeah, definitely.
- He's joking.

169
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:42,946
<i>I always liked that Caspian Wint.</i>

170
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:46,923
He and Charles always seemed to
have a very special connection.

<i>face a decade in Swedish jail.</i>

202
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:48,096
The Swedish courtroom sketches
were just magnificent.

203
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:50,846
They looked like a wonderful Disney film.

204
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,415
<i>Those remarkable sketches
were inspired by this man,</i>

205
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,212
<i>Jan Erik Eckland, a major
fan of Disney films</i>

00:11:58,213 --> 00:12:01,745
<i>and a prominent Swedish courtroom
artist in the late 1950s.</i>

207
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:06,485
Every courtroom artist coming
up after 1955 will tell you

208
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:08,879
<i>they got in the game because
of Jan Erik Eckland.</i>

209
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:14,110
<i>Before Jan Erik Eckland, Swedish courtroom
sketches looked like any other courtroom sketch.</i>

210
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:18,640
Jan Erik said, "I want to do something
different. I want to do something fun."

211
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,494
He comes along and turns the dull
settings into fantastical worlds

212
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:26,916
<i>complete with anthropomorphic
animals and magical beings.</i>

213
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:31,018
<i>Jan Erik inspired courtroom
artists all over the world</i>

214
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:34,134
<i>and began a renaissance
of courtroom sketching.</i>

215
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:39,480
<i>And there are certain perks that come with
being at the forefront of your industry.</i>

216
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,668
Jan Erik is driving fancy cars,

217
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:44,419
<i>sleeping with gorgeous women.
He owns a biplane.</i>

218
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,236
This guy was on top of the world.

219
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:50,006
<i>The only thing left for Jan
Erik Eckland wasn't on Earth.</i>

220
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:51,908
So he built this rocket ship.

221
00:12:52,182 --> 00:12:54,221
<i>He said, "I'm gonna find a new planet</i>

222
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:57,850
<i>with better food and prettier
women and crazier drugs."</i>

223
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,647
<i>The rocket blew up on launch.</i>

224
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:14,255
So Aaron owed $12 million
to the Swedish government

225
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,913
and his inability to come up with the funds

226
00:13:16,938 --> 00:13:20,760
led him into a pit of despair, AKA, PCP.

227
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:26,158
Boogie, boogie, boogie.

228
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,880
Nobody wants to end up in prison.

229
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:35,088
But if you do end up in prison,
Swedish prison's the way to go.

230
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:40,306
<i>It's a lot like living in a very
modern home with mid-century finishes.</i>

231
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:45,784
<i>And once again, people assumed that was the
last they would ever hear of Aaron Williams.</i>

232
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:48,673
_

233
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:53,245
So, Charles, you're now
number two in the world.

234
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:56,197
You're favored to win Wimbledon,
which would make you number one.

235
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:57,441
How do you do it?

236
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,734
Yeah, well, when I'm playing

237
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:02,245
I serve the ball and the man

238
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:06,480
opposite me on the other side of
the court, he plays it back to me.

239
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:08,736
Now, then I

240
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,846
try to hit to a place in the
court that he's not standing in anymore.

241
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,692
And if he manages to reach
that and play it back,

242
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:16,913
if it lands short, I run forward

243
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:21,245
and then I try and get it to another place
in the court that he's not standing anymore.

244
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:25,493
And sometimes it goes outside of these
lines on the side of the court.

245
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:28,346
And if that happens, the ump,
he shouts, "Out!"

246
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:31,182
And that's... that's very
bad if that happens to me.

247
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:33,924
But if it happens to the other
player, I really like that.

248
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:36,336
I understand how the game
of tennis is played.

249
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:39,413
I guess I meant, what's
your overall strategy?

250
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,068
Yeah, yeah.
Indubitably, yeah.

251
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:44,421
Okay.

252
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,835
You know, Charles, you...
you can't help but compare your

253
00:14:48,147 --> 00:14:50,402
<i>career to that of Aaron Williams.</i>

254
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,893
And I think it's fair to
say there's been a debate

255
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:55,245
<i>about who's the better player.
Would you say</i>

256
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,611
it's you?

257
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:00,467
Yeah.

258
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:06,504
<i>That sheepish comment unexpectedly
made it halfway around the world...</i>

259
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,614
_
<i>To an all-male orgy.</i>

260
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,278
_

261
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,610
<i>Would you say it's you?</i>

262

Yeah.

263
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:35,206
_

264
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:38,980
<i>And with a seemingly innocuous statement
that should have gone unnoticed...</i>

265
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,126

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,312
<i>Despite the escaped convict, Charles' fate
to be world number one seemed predetermined.</i>

274
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:26,280
<i>But would it come at the following Grand
Slam, on his home court at Wimbledon?</i>

275
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:31,481
_

276
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:33,145
<i>An Englishman hadn't won Wimbledon</i>

277
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:35,302
since Fred Perry in 1937,

278
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,712
so there was tremendous pressure on
Charles to bring the trophy home.

279
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,422
I mean, can you imagine?

280
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,230
Yeah, thank you so much.

281
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:46,114
Yeah.

282
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:48,634
Yeah, goodbye, ma'am.

283
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:52,846
- That was the Queen.
<i>- What did she want?</i>

284
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:55,479
She wanted me to win.

285
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,532
<i>With the weight of an
entire nation on his back,</i>

286
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:02,014
<i>Charles stepped up his
training to a diabolical level.</i>

287
00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:19,413
<i>Winning the seven matches necessary
to bring the trophy home to England</i>

288
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,446
<i>seemed nothing more than protocol.</i>

289
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:24,530
<i>Until an unexpected guest showed up.</i>

290
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:27,469
_

291
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,631
No one expected Aaron
to come back to tennis.

292
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:31,701
I mean, he got that awful tattoo.

293
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:34,381
<i>No one pictured Aaron Williams
back on a tennis court</i>

294
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:38,150
<i>until a young PR man at the
All England Club had an idea.</i>

295
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:41,467
The All England Club is allowed to
admit players through a wild card.

296
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:44,935
So I proposed we let Aaron play
for the press it would bring.

297
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:48,335
I did not like the proposal one bit.

298
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:54,528
The duke was furious upon hearing the name,
but cooler heads prevailed when I assured him

299
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,240
Aaron would lose badly
after not playing for years.

300
00:17:57,381 --> 00:18:01,904
Not to mention we would have him lose to an
Englishman who was certain to humiliate him.

301
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:07,082
<i>That Englishman was obviously
Charles Lloyd Poole.</i>

302
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:12,287
_

303
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,125
Every tennis fan had been
dying for these two to play.

304
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:22,055
<i>It was a guaranteed, epic match.</i>

305
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,944
Not to mention all the trim it would bring.

306
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:34,680
The second they entered the stadium, all
the girls would just soak their socks.

307
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:36,351
<i>Jesus.</i>

308
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,381
<i>Just moments ago, the first to walk onto Centre Court and
prepare to open play for this fortnight at Wimbledon...</i>

309

<i>Oh, my God.
He appears to be wearing</i>

00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:49,373
<i>some kind of sleeveless,
denim button-down.</i>

311
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:51,546
<i>Pros are sponsored and given clothes.</i>

312
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,076
Here's the problem, though.
No one wanted to give Aaron an endorsement

313
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:57,798
until Jordache decided to get in the game.

314
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:02,580
The spirit of Jordache
is one of experimentation.

315
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:07,231
If I dig that shit, I think the
customer's gonna dig that shit.

316
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:11,519
That white denim has to go down as
the all-time worst tennis outfit.

317
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:14,046
I liked his hair and he
looked good in the jeans.

318
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:15,508
<i>End of story.</i>

319
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:18,545
Look, in the first rounds of any tournament,

320
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,559
you have top-seeded guys playing low-ranked
guys and there's rarely a surprise.

321
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,696
<i>And the start of the
Williams-Poole match</i>

322
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:31,635
seemed to be going accordingly.

323
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:37,346
The guy was 30.
He hadn't played in years.

324
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
<i>It looks like he's never
played tennis before.</i>

325
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,507
<i>The guy's just dying out there.</i>

326
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:46,933
He looked like an old, faded drug addict.

327
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:48,951
Which is what he was.

328
00:19:49,213 --> 00:19:51,401
<i>Charles effortlessly destroyed Aaron</i>

329
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:54,353
<i>in the first set in an
unprecedented 21 minutes.</i>

330
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:56,453
<i>It was on course to be over soon.</i>

331
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:58,692
<i>But the weather had other plans.</i>

332
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:02,898
Look! It's raining. We have to stop.
We have to stop. It's raining.

333
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:06,491
<i>We'll have to continue this match tomorrow.</i>

334
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:09,145
<i>If you want to catch the end,
be sure to tune in on time</i>

335
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:10,856
<i>because it won't last long.</i>

336
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,694
He played so bad, Jordache
pulled its sponsorship.

337
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:15,943
Thank God.

338
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:19,218
We lost a lot of money with that
endorsement, and I lost my job.

339
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,737
But I sell pianos now.
I fucking love it.

340
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,740
<i>The scoreboard said it all.</i>

341
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:26,680
<i>And the battle would
conclude the following day.</i>

342
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:28,336
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

343
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,046
_

344
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:33,585
What happened the second day was
nothing short of a miracle.

345
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,353
<i>- Another winner from Aaron.</i>
- Yeah!

346
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:46,664
<i>- This guy has been totally reborn.
- It's like riding a bike.</i>

347
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,362
It just clicked for him on that second day.

348
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:54,914
I couldn't see. Was it in?
Did it go in?

349
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,480
- Yeah.
- <i> My point?</i>

350
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,680
- Yeah, yeah, it went in. Your point.
- <i> Okay, cool.</i>

351
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:01,713
And that confidence gave him
a huge burst of energy.

352
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:04,951
<i>It looks like Aaron's having some
fun with the line judge out there.</i>

353
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:10,516
<i>But others suspected that burst of energy was
from something much more illicit than confidence.</i>

354
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:15,380
It was pretty obvious that he had
hidden cocaine in his water bottles...

355
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,391
and in his rackets...

356
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,763
and in his coke necklace.

357
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:25,080
And even on the lines of the court.

358
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:30,731
<i>Seems crazy now, but you gotta remember</i>

359
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,646
this is before cocaine was illegal.

360
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:35,951
<i>- Cocaine was always illegal.</i>
- Really?

361
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,681
Oh, we knew he was on cocaine.

362
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:43,847
It's just that in England it's
very rude to point things out.

363
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,686
<i>Whatever the reason for Aaron's
sudden energy and inspiration...</i>

364
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:52,844
<i>It appears there's a bit of blood
on his wristband from his nose.</i>

365
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,069
<i>It led to arguably the
greatest tennis of his life.</i>

366
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:58,346
<i>The match was expected to end quickly.</i>

367
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:02,060
<i>But Aaron's rally extended the game,
leaving it tied at two sets each.</i>

368
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,104
<i>It would be the first match in
tennis history to go three days.</i>

369
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,923
_

370
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:12,137
When I got in, there was a
message from the Queen.

371
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,326
_

372
00:22:17,476 --> 00:22:18,710
_

373
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:21,761
_

374
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,051
_

375
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:27,518
_

376
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:31,040
<i>Wow, the Queen of
England really wants you to win.</i>

377
00:22:31,713 --> 00:22:36,058
<i>- How are you dealing with the pressure?</i>
- Will you excuse me just... just for one second?

378
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:47,444
_

379
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:52,181
You're experiencing something
that is the optimum in tennis.

380
00:22:53,722 --> 00:22:55,823
<i>The following day began
at the crack of dawn.</i>

381
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:04,659
<i>And the play was again remarkable.</i>

382
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:12,696
<i>What? Come on!</i>

383
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:20,307
<i>How'd he get to that?</i>

384
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,913
<i>Unbelievable.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

385
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:27,883
<i>This is like nothing I've ever seen.</i>

386
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:33,220
<i>Spectacular!</i>

387
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:35,940
<i>Absolutely spectacular!</i>

388
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,805
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

389
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:48,227
<i>What? Come on!</i>

390
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:52,521
<i>I'm gonna go ahead and call that the
greatest point in tennis history.</i>

391
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:55,256
<i>In the fifth set of Wimbledon,
there's no tie break,</i>

392
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,552
<i>so you play until one man wins by two games,</i>

393
00:23:57,742 --> 00:24:00,142
be it 8-6, or 9-7,

394
00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:03,358
or 10-8...
Or 11-9, for example.

395
00:24:03,482 --> 00:24:06,673
They could theoretically
play forever, which is scary

396
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:09,538
for somebody like me who doesn't
much like watching tennis.

397
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,182
<i>The match stretched on
for eight hours that day,</i>

398
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,801
<i>but neither side was able to claim victory.</i>

399
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,788
_

400
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,840
_

401
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,123
_

402
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:29,104
_

403
00:24:29,221 --> 00:24:31,268
_

404
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:35,218
_

405
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:39,007
_

406
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:42,459
_

407
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,340
_

408
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:49,315
On day four, Aaron came out
completely depleted.

409
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,961
Oh, Jesus Christ, easy.

410
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:59,988
<i>His legs were like Jell-O,
just two little pudding pops.</i>

411
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,625
<i>He's collapsed like a baby deer.</i>

412
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:05,134
<i>No fight in his eyes.</i>

413
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,258
- Out.
<i>- But just when it seemed.</i>

414
00:25:09,282 --> 00:25:11,015
<i>Aaron was on his last breath,</i>

415
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,481
<i>he was granted a gift from the gods.</i>

416
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:17,978
<i>Charles up a break, one point
awayfrom finally ending this.</i>

417
00:25:18,698 --> 00:25:20,888
<i>And now this match has it all.</i>

418
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:24,102
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a streaker.</i>

419
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,053
<i>Looks like security has her now.</i>

420
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,674
<i>Seems Aaron wants to take care
of the situation himself.</i>

421
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,060
<i>He's holding his hand out
to calm the streaker.</i>

422
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:37,451
<i>He's made eye contact with her.</i>

423
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:42,083
<i>Whoa, whoa, what's going on down there?</i>

424
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,730
<i>Whatever he said to her
was quite the line, Chris.</i>

425
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:45,958
What's he doing to her?

426
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:49,614
<i>It appears that Aaron is now
copulating with the random streaker.</i>

427
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,904
Is no one gonna stop this?

428
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,654
<i>You'd think that a player would be disqualified
for having sex on the court for over four hours, but</i>

429
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:59,214
really, there's no rule in the book about it.

430
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:02,588
So what could we do, but watch?

431
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:08,606
<i>He went down on her for a solid hour at
least, the whole time high-fiving her.</i>

432
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:12,210
It was like nothing I'd ever seen,
and I'm no stranger to adult films.

433
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:15,125
<i>Whoo! That's what
I'm talking about.</i>

434
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,817
<i>Quiet on the court, please.</i>

435
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:21,156
<i>For Aaron, the streaker was a
life preserver in a sea of grass</i>

436
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,807
<i>and he clung to her for dear life</i> -
<i>until he could no longer hang on.</i>

437
00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:27,141
<i>Are they clapping because
they're happy it's over</i>

438
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:28,954
<i>or are they proud of his work?</i>

439
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:32,799
<i>Hard to say, but it looks like we
might actually get back to tennis.</i>

440
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:35,955
<i>Whoo!</i>

441
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:38,141
<i>Spoke too soon.</i>

442
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,406
<i>We've got another streaker.
This one's a dude.</i>

443
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:45,298
<i>It appears Aaron is not
as happy to see this guy.</i>

444
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,740
<i>Oh, wait.</i>

445
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:50,144
<i>It looks like he's gonna bone him too.</i>

446
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:58,806
<i>They are having sex.</i>

447
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:02,938
<i>Well, if you need to stall, this
is definitely one way to do it.</i>

448
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,656
<i>They're letting out a harmonized moan now.</i>

449
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,461
<i>These guys are really in sync.</i>

450
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:12,179
He... he came so hard,
it made a divot in the court.

451
00:27:12,452 --> 00:27:14,147
<i>Looks like they've finished up.</i>

452
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:18,576
<i>The female streaker has returned for more.</i>

453
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,684
<i>We've got three bodies, two of them naked.</i>

454
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:24,145
<i>Oh, I think I know
how this is gonna pan out.</i>

455
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,638
<i>And now Aaron is kissing
the female streaker.</i>

456
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:29,471
<i>And now, the male streaker.</i>

457
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:32,615
<i>And now he's making the two streakers kiss.</i>

458
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,667
<i>The lovemaking lasted until nightfall</i>

459
00:27:35,925 --> 00:27:38,180
<i>and Aaron survived another day.</i>

460
00:27:38,203 --> 00:27:41,372
_

461
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,715
Good morning.

462
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:45,945
Before I get started, I just want to say

463
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:49,623
I'm not going to apologize
for the incidents in yesterday's match.

464
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:54,386
What happens between two or three people
on the Wimbledon courts is between them.

465
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:56,660
And it's natural and it's beautiful.

466
00:27:56,931 --> 00:27:59,048
That out of the way, as many of you know,

467
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:02,359
I've spent years searching for the
true identity of my birth father.

468
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,811
I'm an orphan.
Adopted.

469
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:06,491
And...

470
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:09,169
I'm happy to announce
that today I have found him.

471
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:12,492
His name is England's own...

472
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:15,184
Engelbert Humperdinck.

473
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,558
And I'd like to hereby announce

474
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:20,451
that my performance in this match

475
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:23,161
will be dedicated to my native home

476
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,342
of Great Britain.

477
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:28,307
England's true son has returned!

478
00:28:28,588 --> 00:28:29,801
Whoo!

479
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,166
See you on the court.

480
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,843
Look, we all know this,
tennis is a head game.

481
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:36,424
And it was a great move
to get in Charles' head.

482
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,962
<i>I mean, the guy's whole identity</i>

483
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:41,299
<i>was based on being the only
British star in the sport.</i>

484
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:43,659
And suddenly, Aaron had taken that from him.

485
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:46,913
<i>Game, Williams.</i>

486
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:49,103
Go, Britain!

487
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:51,128
He's a phony.

488
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:52,607
<i>The crowd loves him.</i>

489
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:55,788
I'm the one
who's English. Me.

490
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,021
<i>Seems everyone's turned on Charles.</i>

491
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:00,704
<i>By this point the English
had bloody had it with Charles</i>

492
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:04,391
and they truly believed Aaron was
a Humperdinck. A brother-in-arms.

493
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:08,268
<i>But the abuse directed at Charles
didn't end with the angry spectators.</i>

494
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:12,917
<i>When he got back to his hotel, he was greeted
by a much more intimidating audience.</i>

495
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,631
_

496
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,221
_

497
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,151
_

498
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:22,212
_

499
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:24,337
_

500
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,766
_

501
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:28,000
_

502
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:30,763
_

503
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:34,054
_

504
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:37,105
_

505
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,522
_

506
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,968
_

507
00:29:42,154 --> 00:29:44,209
_

508
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:47,400
I'm British, eh!

509
00:29:57,914 --> 00:29:59,123
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

510
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:02,278
_

511
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:05,538
Aaron Williams...
has been hit..

512
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:07,458
By a<i> twuck.</i>

513
00:30:09,153 --> 00:30:11,372
Did something happen to Aaron Williams?

514
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,165
- <i> He was hit by a truck.</i>
- He was hit by a truck?

515
00:30:15,068 --> 00:30:16,272
Oh, no.

516
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:19,854
You have two men competing
in a high-stakes match.

517
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,714
One of those men gets hit by a truck.

518
00:30:23,192 --> 00:30:27,236
The other man...
is a licensed big-rig truck driver.

519
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:29,711
<i>But somehow</i>

520
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:33,326
no one thinks to accuse
the guy who's a truck driver.

521
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,892
I'm indubitably concerned about Aaron.

522
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:38,545
It'd be a great shame
if he couldn't play again,

523
00:30:38,576 --> 00:30:41,653
and I advanced and my mum and
everyone liked me again.

524
00:30:41,697 --> 00:30:43,364
No comment.

525
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,806
_

526
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,823
Against the advice of his doctors,
and anyone with eyeballs...

527
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,527
Aaron Williams checked himself out
of his hospital this afternoon

528
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:57,137
to continue his ludicrous,
now six-day match against Poole.

529
00:30:57,711 --> 00:30:59,395
This is not something to miss.

530
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,917
<i>Aaron's right-handed and his right
arm is completely shattered.</i>

531
00:31:08,972 --> 00:31:12,829
So it's like, okay, you want to
keep playing, but with what arm?

532
00:31:14,855 --> 00:31:17,412
<i>It appears Williams is now going to attempt</i>

533
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:19,987
<i>to continue this match with his left hand.</i>

534
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:22,984
<i>I mean, this is just
an exercise in stupidity now.</i>

535
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:25,088
<i>There's no way this works.</i>

536
00:31:31,378 --> 00:31:33,867
<i>A left-handed ace?
Are you kidding me?</i>

537
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:36,101
<i>This guy can do anything.</i>

538
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:49,653
<i>At this point, sports psychologists
explained it was entirely mental.</i>

539
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:52,281
No man would ever break the
other's serve because, A...

540
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:55,023
He didn't believe he could,
and, B... he didn't want to.

541
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:57,650
They had both made a deal with
themselves that this is how

542
00:31:57,674 --> 00:31:59,556
they would spend the rest of their lives.

543
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,069
And they were okay with that.
And so was I.

544
00:32:03,276 --> 00:32:05,494
<i>But in the 196th game of play,</i>

545
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,366
<i>it seemed Charles was ready
to break that pattern.</i>

546
00:32:08,912 --> 00:32:11,452
<i>Up for the first time
at triple match break point,</i>

547
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,363
<i>Charles had three opportunities
to put an end to the nightmare.</i>

548
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:18,299
What happened in '98, '97,

549
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:21,769
I would call the greatest
travesty in sports history.

550
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:25,467
<i>Please end it.
Please end it.</i>

551
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,530
<i>What the...?
What's going on?</i>

552
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:32,599
<i>It's David Copperfield!</i>

553
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:35,844
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
- At that point, you'd just seen it all.

554
00:32:36,214 --> 00:32:40,226
Aaron was in no way responsible.
It was simply a trick gone wrong.

555
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:43,306
I was supposed to appear on
top of the Statue of Liberty.

556
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:47,002
But sometimes these things just...
Well, they just happen.

557
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:51,449
<i>Charles couldn't concentrate after that.</i>

558
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,519
Playing at Wimbledon is hard enough

559
00:32:53,578 --> 00:32:55,570
<i>then add on top of that all the pressure</i>

560
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:59,025
<i>and fear that a magician might appear
on your shoulders at any time.</i>

561
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:03,919
<i>Whatever it was that happened, it now seemed
the match would never reach a conclusion.</i>

562
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:05,551
- <i>30-15.
- Until...</i>

563
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:11,674
_

564
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:18,570
<i>Aaron, how are you feeling?</i>
- I feel great.

565
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:22,329
I popped my shoulder back into place
"Lethal Weapon" style, so good to go there.

566
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:25,673
And Charles didn't try and hit
me with his truck last night.

567
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:27,201
<i>So that always helps.</i>

568
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:31,079
<i>Charles, what are your
thoughts on the sex tape?</i>

569
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:32,449
What sex tape?

570
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:35,520
Ooh, you hadn't heard about that?

571
00:33:36,003 --> 00:33:37,306
What sex tape?

572
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:39,046
<i>The one with Aaron and Lily.</i>

573
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:41,778
- <i>Is it recording?
- Yeah, it's on.</i>

574
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,064
It's going.

575
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,822
_

576
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:50,434
One doesn't expect this type of
thing to be released to the public.

577
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,878
It was... rather embarrassing.

578
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:55,284
Not so much for me, but more for Aaron.

579
00:33:56,096 --> 00:33:59,057
_

580
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:02,799
_

581
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:04,963
_

582
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:07,011
I empathize.
I've been there, you know?

583
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,182
_

584
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:11,916
_

585
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
_

586
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,909
_

587
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,914
I am so disappointed that surfaced
today of all days, you know?

588
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,869
I don't want to distract from the match.

589
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,132
Whoa, whoa. Hey!

590
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:27,579
It was his biggest secret.

591
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:31,710
He started balding around 13.

592
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:34,668
<i>If you're gonna wear a wig,</i>

593
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:36,438
why would you wear <i>that</i> wig?

594
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:41,382
If you are gonna wear a wig,
<i>that's</i> the one to wear.

595
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:44,711
- Don't touch my hair, bro!
- Don't touch my bloody girl, mate!

596
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,889
- You're dead, bro.
- You're dead, mate.

597
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:49,266
Ugh!
- Get off of me, man!

598
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,487
- Get off of<i> me,</i> man.
- Get off of me, dude, bro.

599
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:53,250
I'll see you on the court, mate, dude.

600
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:55,347
- Get off!
- Get off. Get off!

601
00:35:03,784 --> 00:35:05,027
<i>Would you look at this?</i>

602
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,967
<i>For the first time since 1977,
the Queen is back at Wimbledon.</i>

603
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,293
You have taken everything from me,

604
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,278
but you will not take this match!

605
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:33,048
I'm taking your virginity next.

606
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:36,052
<i>This is more of a street brawl
than a Sunday at Wimbledon.</i>

607
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:38,692
<i>Finally the tension rose to a boiling point</i>

608
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,186
<i>and the lid was knocked off the pot.</i>

609
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:44,548
Yeah!
Come on, motherfucker!

610
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:46,414
<i>- <b>Bring it.</b></i>
- Whoo!

611
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,041
What did you just do?

612
00:35:51,581 --> 00:35:53,447
What'd I do?
I didn't do anything.

613
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:56,697
I honestly didn't notice anything,

614
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,927
but Charles clearly saw something.

615
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:02,744
To me, a very clear, very well
done "pussy-eating" sign.

616
00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:08,117
<i>It did seem unintentional,
but knowing my brother,</i>

617
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:10,661
I'd guess it was very<i> intentional.</i>

618
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:15,715
Well, if Charles had actually
watched the provoking tape,

619
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:17,579
he probably wouldn't have cared at all.

620
00:36:17,621 --> 00:36:19,666
<i>The one-two punch of
the sex tape with his girl</i>

621
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,123
and whatever gesture he made, it
was more than Charles could take.

622
00:36:23,244 --> 00:36:26,114
- You want to fight me?
- I will rip you in half if you want to go.

623
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:28,382
<i>This shouldn't be happening at Wimbledon.</i>
- Let's go.

624
00:36:28,405 --> 00:36:29,777
I'll rip you in half, mate.

625
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:32,661
<i>This is not what you want to see.
</i> - I will rip you in half.

626
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,079
No.

627
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:37,603
Let them fight.

628
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,940
And that was how it ended.

629
00:37:13,512 --> 00:37:15,005
They killed each other.

630
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:19,255
<i>They lived to play each other.</i>

631
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:23,065
<i>They died playing each other.</i>

632
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:27,615
You know, it only seemed right
that they be buried together

633
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:29,916
in the same coffin.

634
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,778
I've seen too many dead
bodies on the tennis court.

635
00:37:44,112 --> 00:37:46,576
<i>I would have spent more time with him, but</i>

636
00:37:47,387 --> 00:37:49,572
he was obsessed with tennis.

637
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:54,985
<i>They were two of England's greatest sons.</i>

638
00:37:55,668 --> 00:37:58,864
Except for Aaron Williams,
who was not English.

639
00:38:04,478 --> 00:38:06,344
Aaron may have died,

640
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:08,487
but his spirit lives on in all of us.

641
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,583
That was perhaps his greatest trick.

642
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:14,311
Actually, somebody
should say that at<i> my</i> funeral.

643
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:16,570
That's the perfect thing to say about me.

644
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:24,800
I really did love them both.
Charles was so dim.

645
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,608
And Aaron was so bad at getting erect.

646
00:38:31,905 --> 00:38:33,472
It would have been incredibly tragic

647
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:36,929
if these were football players
or basketball players.

648
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:39,947
But it was tennis players.
Who cares?

649
00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:49,275
<i>Do you have any...
Any role models?</i>

650
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:52,166
Oh, yes.

651
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:54,331
I really look up to Aaron Williams.

652
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:56,358
He's my favorite tennis player,

653
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:59,347
and person of all time.

654
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:05,655
You are a fascinating creature.

655
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:08,025
<i>Charles Lloyd Poole.</i>

656
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:09,778
Do you genuinely hate him?

657
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:12,298
No, no.
I don't hate him.

658
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:15,173
I mean, I respect the shit out of that kid.

659
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:19,603
It seemed like I hate him,
sure, but hate, love,

660
00:39:21,112 --> 00:39:25,525
I mean, those are just two flip sides
of the same quesadilla,<i> amiga.</i>

661
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,556
The great quesadilla in the sky.

662
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,492
Yeah.

663
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,900
If I die, that should be
the last shot, of my dock.

664
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,800
I don't know what the word "strategy" means,
Bryant Gumbel.

665
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:12,201
I'm not Bryant Gumbel.
I'm Soledad O'Brien.

666
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,070
I'm at the wrong show.

667
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:18,226
Putting a tennis player in denim was
the first in a series of bad choices

668
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:19,929
that I made as president of Jordache.

669
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:22,918
I sponsored a bunch of Mexican
guys who do cockfights.

670
00:40:22,945 --> 00:40:27,248
I started a JonBenét Ramsey line of denim,
after she died.

671
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,545
How's it going?
- It's good.

672
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:32,775
Like 25%.

673
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:34,273
<i>I would presume</i>

674
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:36,945
that there's only one way to grip a<i> wacket.</i>

675
00:40:37,612 --> 00:40:40,061
Oh, no, there's loads
of ways to grip a racket.

676
00:40:40,157 --> 00:40:42,744
- Do tell.
- You can hold it like this

677
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,025
when you want to make
a big shot over the head.

678
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,353
What if it's a very dirty handle?

679
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:55,726
Last month you crashed
your Lamborghini Countach into your Viper.

680
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:56,880
What happened?

681
00:40:56,905 --> 00:41:00,371
What's the PC way to say I got
fucked up with two Puerto Ricans?

682
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:01,878
There really isn't one.

683
00:41:01,913 --> 00:41:04,132
I got fucked up with two Puerto Ricans.

684
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,983
- Bro, bro.
- Mate, mate.

685
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:07,943
- Bro, bro.
- Mate, mate.

686
00:41:09,657 --> 00:41:10,927
Mate!

687
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:15,797
<i>I actually heard that they dropped
the coffin into the sewer.</i>

688
00:41:15,885 --> 00:41:18,277
A friend of mine didn't believe it.
I did believe it.

689
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:20,268
I thought that sounds about right.

690
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:24,157
<i>- How are you dealing with the pressure?</i>
- Just got to get a sip of water.

691
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,775
<i>What's wrong with this kid?</i>

692
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:47,293
It was seven days in hell.

693
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:50,233
<i>Why are you looking at the lens?</i>

694
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:53,496
'Cause I think that would make a good title.
"Seven Days In Hell."
