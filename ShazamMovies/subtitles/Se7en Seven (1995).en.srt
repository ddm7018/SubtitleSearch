1
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,009
Neighbours heard them
screaming at each other,

2
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,533
like, for two hours.

3
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,498
Then they heard the gun
go off, both barrels.

4
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,889
Crime of passion.

5
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,254
Yeah.

6
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,138
Just look at all
the passion on that wall.

7
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,609
Yeah, well, it's a done deal,

8
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,179
all but the paperwork.

9
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,532
The kid see it?

10
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,689
What?

11
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,099
The kid.

12
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,092
What kind of fucking
question is that?

13
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,410
We are all going to be real glad

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,934
when we get rid of you,
Somerset.

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,578
It's always these questions.

16
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,332
Who gives a fuck?

17
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,650
He's dead. His wife killed him.

18
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,538
Anything else, it has
nothing to do with us.

19
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,572
Detective Somerset?

20
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,333
I'm Detective Mills.

21
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,854
Lieutenant, I apologise
for interrupting,

22
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,738
but I just get in town

23
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,048
they dump me here.

24
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,017
Look, um... Mills?

25
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,489
I thought we might
find a bar some place.

26
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,775
I'd like to get
to the precinct.

27
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,249
Not much time for
this transition thing.

28
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,570
I meant to ask you something

29
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,049
when we spoke
on the phone before.

30
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,459
Yep.

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,973
Why here?

32
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,493
I don't follow.

33
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,378
Well, all this effort
to get transferred.

34
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,098
It's the first question

35
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,011
that popped into my head.

36
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,853
I guess the same reasons as you,

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,817
the same reasons you had

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,289
before you decided
to quit, yeah?

39
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,211
You just met me.

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,531
Maybe I'm not understanding
the question.

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,333
It's very simple.

42
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,253
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

43
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,093
I've just never seen it
done that way before.

44
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,011
I thought I could do some good.

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,977
Look. It would be great for me

46
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,857
if we didn't start out

47
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,771
kicking each other in the balls.

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,249
But you're calling
the shots, Lieutenant.

49
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,173
Yeah. I want you to look,

50
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,854
and I want you to listen, OK?

51
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,976
I wasn't guarding the Taco Bell.

52
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,857
I've worked homicide five years.

53
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,214
Not here.

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,574
I understand that.

55
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,457
Over the next
seven days, Detective,

56
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,008
you'll do me the favour
of remembering that.

57
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,210
You've got me closer to God

58
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,732
Hello.

59
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,253
Yep. OK.

60
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,173
Say it again.

61
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,977
I thought we moved here

62
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,255
to get away from tractor pulls.

63
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,818
Serpico's got to go.

64
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,174
Yeah. Well,

65
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,455
you might want to get rid of

66
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,770
this little crusty.
This eye, Serpico.

67
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,293
Did you get it?

68
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,699
Got it.

69
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,973
Coffee? No?

70
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,253
Nothing's been touched.

71
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,217
Everything's like I found it.

72
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,131
What time
was death established?

73
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,448
Like I said,

74
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,292
I didn't touch anything,

75
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,894
but he's got his face
in a plate of spaghetti

76
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,777
for about 45 minutes now.

77
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,090
No one bothers with vital signs?

78
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,659
Did I stutter?

79
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,173
This guy ain't breathing

80
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,455
unless he started
breathing spaghetti sauce.

81
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,417
So that's how it's done here.

82
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,695
This guy's been
sitting in a pile

83
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,577
of his own piss and shit.

84
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,493
If he wasn't dead,
he would have stood up by now.

85
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,013
Thank you, officer.

86
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,533
Thank you.

87
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,139
I wonder...

88
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,337
What exactly was the point

89
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,253
of the conversation
you were about to get into?

90
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,568
Don't know.

91
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,491
How many times has Barney Fife

92
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,969
found dead bodies
that weren't dead?

93
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,379
Drop it.

94
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,378
Somebody phone Guinness.

95
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,372
I think we've
got a record here.

96
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,771
Better homes and gardens.

97
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,978
Who said this was murder?

98
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,618
No one.

99
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,056
The guy's heart has got to be

100
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,017
the size of a canned ham.

101
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,769
If this isn't a coronary...

102
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,170
Ha ha! Well, I don't know.

103
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,333
Whoops!

104
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,930
How about that?

105
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,458
We had this case once...

106
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,895
Guy dead on the ground,

107
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,335
knife in his back.

108
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,172
Got to be murder, right?

109
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,613
Fuck.

110
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,533
Anyway, big insurance
policy involved, yeah?

111
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,180
The guy took
the tip of the blade,

112
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,569
stuck it in
his own shoulder blades.

113
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,618
He must have screwed up a
few times. There was multiples.

114
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,497
Could you please be quiet?

115
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,339
Wait a minute.

116
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,819
What?

117
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,777
Got a bucket here.

118
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,737
What's in it?

119
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,412
Oh, God!

120
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,172
Fucking vomit.

121
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,618
Any blood in it?

122
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,134
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

123
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,656
Are you thinking it's poison?

124
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,889
Oh, wonderful.

125
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,936
Very moody.

126
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,658
Are you thinking
it's poison, Somerset?

127
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,459
You girls have got
forensics waiting outside.

128
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,293
I don't know
if we'll all fit, though.

129
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,053
There's room.
Light's the problem.

130
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,132
Detective Mills, would you
go help the officers

131
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,017
question the neighbours?

132
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,379
What?

133
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,975
Send in forensics
on your way out, please.

134
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,538
He's dead.

135
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,977
Thank you, Doctor.

136
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,697
You've seen my files, right?

137
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,577
You've seen
the things I've done.

138
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,379
No.

139
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,695
Well, I did my time
walking the beat.

140
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,738
I did that shit for a long time.

141
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,776
And?

142
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,773
My badge says Detective,
the same as yours.

143
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,418
Look. I made a decision.

144
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,697
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene.

145
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,975
Couldn't worry
whether you thought

146
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,130
you were getting enough time
on the playing field.

147
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,415
Hey, man...

148
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,297
Just don't jerk me off.

149
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,052
That's all I ask.

150
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,330
He's been dead a long time,

151
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,809
and I can tell you
it was not a poison.

152
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,413
Oh, man.

153
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,730
How does someone
let themselves go like that?

154
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,219
Lt took four orderlies

155
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,973
just to get him on the table.

156
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,459
But how'd the fat fuck

157
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,496
ever fit out his front door?

158
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,253
Please. It's obvious
he was a shut-in.

159
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,932
Now look at this.

160
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,056
See how big this stomach is?

161
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,529
And the strange thing is...
Stretches.

162
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,453
Here. Look at the size
of the cardiac orifice

163
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,768
where the food...

164
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,249
I see, but that means
nothing to me.

165
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,298
He's got lines of distension
across the duodenum,

166
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,133
and the interior wall
is ripped open.

167
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,893
This man ate till he burst?

168
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,811
He didn't really burst,

169
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,128
not all the way,

170
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,051
but he was haemorrhaging
internally.

171
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,370
There was a haematoma
in the rectus.

172
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,497
So he did die by eating.

173
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,013
Yes and no.

174
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,691
What about
these bruises up here?

175
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,250
I haven't figured that out yet.

176
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,217
Gun pressed against his head?

177
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,574
Pressed hard enough, sure.

178
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,854
Fuck, yeah.

179
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,771
The marks from the front side

180
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,657
flush with the muzzle.

181
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,617
Ladies and gentlemen,

182
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,930
we have ourselves a homicide.

183
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,293
Killer put a bucket beneath him,

184
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,132
kept on serving.

185
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,939
Coroner said this could have
gone on for more than 12 hours.

186
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,419
Victim's throat was swollen,

187
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,297
probably from the effort,

188
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,859
and there was definitely a point

189
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,259
when he passed out.

190
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,331
The killer kicked him,
and he burst.

191
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,297
Oof! Sadistic fucker, huh?

192
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,211
When you want somebody dead,

193
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,451
you don't risk the time
it takes to do this,

194
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,770
unless the act itself
has meaning.

195
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,293
Come on.

196
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,575
Somebody had a problem
with the fat boy

197
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,491
and decided to torture him.

198
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,378
In the grocery bags,
we found two receipts.

199
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,054
That means the killer
stopped in the middle

200
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,734
and made a second trip
to the supermarket.

201
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,139
So?

202
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,778
Hey, man... It's his thing.

203
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,498
I've been out
in the rain all day.

204
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,457
This is beginning.

205
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,417
We've got one dead guy,
not three.

206
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,694
No motive.

207
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,011
Don't even start
your big brain cooking on this,

208
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,692
all right? Please.

209
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,533
I'd like to be reassigned.

210
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,212
What? Whoa.

211
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,211
What in the hell
are you talking about?

212
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,131
This can't be my last duty.

213
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,131
It's just going
to go on and on.

214
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,573
You're retiring.

215
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,936
Six more days
and you're all the way gone.

216
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,693
Won't be the first time
you've left unfinished business.

217
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,658
Those cases were taken as close
to conclusion as possible,

218
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,970
and if I may speak freely...

219
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,652
This should not be
his first assignment.

220
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,378
I knew it.

221
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,735
This is not
my first assignment, you dick.

222
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,889
It's too soon.

223
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,097
I'm here. You can say
that shit to my face.

224
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,408
It's too soon.

225
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,298
Captain, if we can
just talk in private.

226
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,894
This isn't working.
It's a personal thing.

227
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,652
Shut up, Mills.

228
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,971
Look. I don't have
anyone else to put on this.

229
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,618
This is Metro.

230
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,009
You don't just get to swap.

231
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,738
Give it to me.

232
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,333
Fuck him.

233
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,092
See you later.

234
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,215
Give it to me.

235
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,211
I'm putting you
on something else.

236
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,970
Go on, Mills. Just go on.

237
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,131
I'm sorry, old buddy,

238
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,055
but it looks like you're stuck
cleaning up the fat man.

239
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,177
All right. Here we go.

240
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,534
Quiet down.

241
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,894
All right. Calm down.

242
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,413
Calm down.

243
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,899
Quiet down!

244
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,857
Calm down. Quiet down.

245
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,137
Now, here's how
it's going to be.

246
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,450
I'll answer questions
for 10 minutes.

247
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,735
If those questions do not come

248
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,856
in a calm, sane,
and orderly fashion,

249
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,931
I'm on my way out of here.

250
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,294
Detective.

251
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,655
Can I have
a moment of your time?

252
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,895
I will not discuss the details

253
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,335
of this ongoing investigation.

254
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,539
There he is.

255
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,454
That's the guy.

256
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,768
It looks like

257
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,418
we won't be eating dinner.

258
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,730
Who is this kid,
anyway? Hotshot.

259
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,295
What have you guys got for me?

260
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,291
Nothing yet, boss.

261
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,057
Why don't you guys, uh...

262
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,608
Go get a coffee, OK?

263
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,895
We have
this breaking story for you.

264
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,414
We're going
to go live downtown

265
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,855
where Defence Attorney
Eli Gould

266
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,817
was found murdered
this morning.

267
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,697
District Attorney
Martin Talbot

268
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,975
is taking questions
from reporters.

269
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,893
There's a conflict of interest
between your office...

270
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,689
That is ridiculous to the point
of being offensive.

271
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,374
There is no conflict
whatsoever.

272
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,055
Is it true that you're far
from apprehending a suspect?

273
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,735
I've just come from a meeting
of law enforcement officials,

274
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,572
and they've assured me

275
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,015
they have
their very best men on this.

276
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,172
This will be
the very definition

277
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,569
of swift justice.

278
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,211
Pardon me, George.

279
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,368
Somerset.

280
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,939
Come in.

281
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,931
Have you heard the news?

282
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,419
Nope. Haven't heard.

283
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,695
Eli Gould was found
murdered this morning.

284
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,169
Someone broke into his law firm

285
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,535
and bled him to death,

286
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,692
wrote the word "Greed"
on the floor.

287
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,088
Greed?

288
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,818
Yeah. In blood.

289
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,130
Mills is heading up
the investigation.

290
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,494
Uh, excuse me.

291
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,569
Excuse me.

292
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,890
Could you not do that, please?

293
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,971
Oh, OK.

294
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,573
Well, good for him.

295
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,414
What in the hell are you
going to do with yourself

296
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,331
out there, Somerset?

297
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,809
Oh, I'll work,
maybe on a farm,

298
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,128
fix my house.

299
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,097
Don't you feel that feeling?

300
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,978
You're not going to be
a cop any more.

301
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,449
That's the whole idea.

302
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,134
I don't think you're leaving.

303
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,654
Hell, you can't leave all this.

304
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,174
A guy's out walking his dog,

305
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,375
gets attacked.

306
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,293
His watch is taken, his wallet.

307
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,972
While he's lying there

308
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,937
on the sidewalk helpless,

309
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,569
his attacker
stabs him in both eyes.

310
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,651
This happened just last night

311
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,173
about four blocks from here.

312
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,171
Yeah, I read about it.

313
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,820
I don't understand
this place any longer.

314
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,811
It's the way it's always been.

315
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,333
Maybe you're right.

316
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,729
You were made for this work,

317
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,493
and I don't think
you can deny that.

318
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,218
Maybe I'm wrong.

319
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,498
The coroner sent
this down for you.

320
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,935
Found them
in the fat boy's stomach

321
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,851
mixed in with the food.

322
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,453
Looks like plastic.

323
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,292
Set them on the desk, please.

324
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,019
They were, uh...
They were fed to him.

325
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,854
Oh, Lord.

326
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,810
This was found on the wall

327
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,572
behind the refrigerator

328
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,298
at the obesity murder scene.

329
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,813
"Long is the way and hard

330
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,858
that out of hell
leads up to light."

331
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,737
Lt's from Milton.

332
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,333
Paradise Lost.

333
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,648
All right.

334
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,809
I'm confused.

335
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,733
It means that
this is beginning.

336
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,812
This was found behind
the same refrigerator,

337
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,050
written in grease.

338
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,415
There are seven deadly
sins, Captain -

339
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,774
gluttony...

340
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,539
greed...

341
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,296
sloth, wrath,
pride, lust...

342
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,813
and envy.

343
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,174
Seven.

344
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,929
This is not even my desk.

345
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,898
You can expect
five more of these.

346
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,730
Now wait a minute.

347
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,254
I can't get
involved in this.

348
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,208
Somerset!

349
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,858
He wanted it.

350
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,975
I'm all over it.

351
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,932
Where you headed?

352
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,415
Far away from here.

353
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,497
Thanks, George.
How you doing?

354
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,649
OK.

355
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,935
I've got two things to look up.

356
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,897
OK. Sit where you'd like.

357
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,891
How's everybody?

358
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,698
Hi there, Smiley.

359
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,613
Come on, George.
Your cards are getting cold.

360
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,930
Duty calls.

361
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,817
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

362
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,811
I'll never understand.

363
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,858
All these books...

364
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,329
A world of knowledge
at your fingertips.

365
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,012
What do you do?

366
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,818
You play poker all night.

367
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,095
Hey, we got culture!

368
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,377
Yeah. We got culture
coming out our ass.

369
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,973
All right!

370
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,858
How's this for culture?

371
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,571
Yo, Smiley.

372
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,209
You really going to miss us.

373
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,131
I just might.

374
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,297
Fucking Dante.

375
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,178
Goddamned poetry-rhyming faggot

376
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,137
piece of shit!

377
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,051
Fucker!

378
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,495
Yeah.

379
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,252
Yeah?

380
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,692
Good work, officer.

381
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,652
Thank you, Lord.

382
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,777
Oh. Sorry.

383
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,098
Be out of your way in a second.

384
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,051
You want your chair?

385
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,017
No. You go right ahead.

386
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,294
Yeah?

387
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,738
Phone.

388
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,253
It's a package deal.

389
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,092
It comes with the office.

390
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,378
Mills.

391
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,133
Are you OK?
Ls something wrong?

392
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,494
You dingleberry.

393
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,289
I told you not to call me
at work.

394
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,416
Yeah. Why?

395
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,853
Why?

396
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,450
Why?

397
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,494
OK.

398
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,419
It's my wife.

399
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,013
Sorry?

400
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,660
She'd like to speak to you.

401
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,253
Uh, this is Detective Somerset.

402
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,731
Well... it's nice
to talk to you, too.

403
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,449
I appreciate the offer, but...

404
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,978
Well, in that case,
I'd be delighted.

405
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,893
Yes, thank you very much.

406
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,936
Bye.

407
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,088
Hon, what...

408
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,295
Well?

409
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,574
Sorry?

410
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,809
Well?

411
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,128
I've been invited

412
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,018
to a late supper
at your apartment.

413
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,579
I accepted.

414
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,888
My... how's that?

415
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,299
Tonight.

416
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,612
Hello, men.

417
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,338
Hi, loser.

418
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,809
Hi, idiot.

419
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,812
This is Trace. Tracy, Somerset.

420
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,379
Hello.

421
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,850
Happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

422
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,012
Except, of course,
your first name.

423
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,533
It's William.

424
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,180
Hmm. It's a good name, William.

425
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,014
William, I'd like you
to meet David.

426
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,692
David, this is William.

427
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,613
I'll be right back.
How are the kids?

428
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,531
Good. They're in their room.

429
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,019
Come on in.

430
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,818
Oh, good dogs!

431
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,936
How are the good dogs?

432
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,697
How are you?

433
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,739
Smells good.

434
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,730
What?

435
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,299
The...

436
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,689
Oh, yeah. I mean thank you.

437
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,532
Um, please, have a seat.

438
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,009
Would you like
something to drink?

439
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,933
Uh, no. No, thanks. I'll wait.

440
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,692
Just throw that anywhere.

441
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,133
Excuse all this mess.

442
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,858
We're still unpacking.

443
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,818
I understand you two
were high-school sweethearts.

444
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,937
Pretty hokey, huh?

445
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,172
I knew on our first date
that this was the guy

446
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,251
I was going to marry.

447
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,853
Really?

448
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,728
He was the funniest guy
I'd ever met.

449
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,089
Really?

450
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,377
Well, it's kind of rare
nowadays, you know...

451
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,657
I mean, that level
of commitment.

452
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,454
Oh, don't worry.

453
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,498
I won't wear it
to the dinner table.

454
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,729
I, uh...

455
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,618
No matter how often I see guns,

456
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,578
I just... I can't
get used to them.

457
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,571
Same here.

458
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,336
Why aren't you
married, William?

459
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,978
Oh, Trace.

460
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,379
What the hell.

461
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,214
I was close once.
Just didn't happen.

462
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,097
It surprises me.

463
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,819
It really does.

464
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,492
Well...

465
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,013
Anyone who spends

466
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,853
a significant
amount of time with me

467
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,658
finds me disagreeable.

468
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,298
Just ask your husband.

469
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,610
Very true. Very, very true.

470
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,897
So how long have you lived here?

471
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,016
Too long.

472
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,129
How do you like it here?

473
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,051
You know,

474
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,416
takes time to settle in.

475
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,331
It'll be good.

476
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,854
You get numb after a while.

477
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,689
There are things to any city...

478
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,928
The subway.

479
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,375
It'll go away in a minute.

480
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,734
It's nothing.

481
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,852
That real-estate guy.

482
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,295
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, hon.

483
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,178
Shows us the place a few times.

484
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,093
I think it's good.
Trace likes it.

485
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,613
Then I start wondering

486
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,214
why he only brings us here

487
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,972
five minutes at a time.

488
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,210
We found out the first night.

489
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,578
The soothing, relaxing,
vibrating home, huh?

490
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,131
I'm sorry.

491
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,329
Yeah, all right, laugh it up.

492
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,217
I don't know what
you're laughing at.

493
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,571
All right already.

494
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,449
The guy had to get in
before the office was closed

495
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,053
and security tightened.

496
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,335
Gould would have
been working late.

497
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,696
I'm certain. He was
the biggest lawyer in town.

498
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,054
Infamous, really.

499
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,574
The body was found
Tuesday morning.

500
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,457
The office was closed Monday.

501
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,373
The guy could have
gotten in on Friday

502
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,850
and had his way
all day Saturday, Sunday,

503
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,373
maybe even Monday.

504
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,052
Look at this.

505
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,700
Gould was bound,
his right arm free.

506
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,295
He was handed
a butcher's knife.

507
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,052
Check out the scale.

508
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,812
A pound of flesh?

509
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,299
Yeah.

510
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,652
"One pound of flesh,

511
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,173
"No more, no less.

512
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,093
"No cartilage, no bone,
but only flesh."

513
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,772
Merchant of Venice.

514
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,054
Didn't see it.

515
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,700
"His task done,
then he would go free."

516
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,089
That chair was soaked
with sweat.

517
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,613
Of course.

518
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,930
The killer would have
wanted Gould

519
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,533
to take his time,

520
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,579
to sit and decide
which cut to make first.

521
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,572
Imagine it. There's
a gun in your face.

522
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,572
Which part of your body
is expendable?

523
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,776
How about the love handle?

524
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,853
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

525
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,137
All right, let's take
a fresh look at these.

526
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,609
Even though
the corpse is there,

527
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,452
I looked through it.

528
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,532
The trick is to find
one item, one detail,

529
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,292
and focus on it

530
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,098
until it's an exhausted
possibility.

531
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,740
I'm going to get
another beer. Beer?

532
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,095
Wine, please.

533
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,733
He's preaching.

534
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,856
He's punishing.

535
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,977
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

536
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,051
There were seven
cardinal virtues

537
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,858
and seven deadly sins

538
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,498
used as teaching tools.

539
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,368
Like in The Parson's Tale,
and what's-his... oh, Dante.

540
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,779
You read them.

541
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,339
Yeah. Well, parts.

542
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,217
Hey, remember in Purgatory,

543
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,858
Dante and his buddy,

544
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,771
they're climbing up the hill,

545
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,294
checking out all
the sinners, yeah?

546
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,575
Yeah. The seven terraces
of purgation.

547
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,094
Right, but there,
pride comes first,

548
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,533
not gluttony.

549
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,212
Well, for now,

550
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,212
let's consider that the books
were the inspiration.

551
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,053
The sermons were about
atonement for sin.

552
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,290
These murders are like
forced attrition.

553
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,699
Forced what?

554
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,975
Attrition. It's when
you regret your sins

555
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,528
but not because you love God.

556
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,894
Oh, like because
someone's sticking

557
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,050
a fucking gun in your face.

558
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,449
No fingerprints.

559
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,053
Nope.

560
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,368
Totally unrelated victims.

561
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,336
Yup.

562
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,854
And no witnesses of any kind.

563
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,331
Which I don't get because
the fucker had to get back out.

564
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,775
Well, in any major city,

565
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,613
minding your own
business is a science.

566
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,578
First thing they teach women
in rape prevention

567
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,491
is never cry for help.

568
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,457
Always yell "Fire."

569
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,292
Nobody answers to "Help."

570
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,291
Holler "Fire,"
They come running.

571
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,018
That's fucked up.

572
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,568
Must have left
another puzzle piece.

573
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,531
You know what? Thank you
for talking this out,

574
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,339
but I got to sleep,
walk the dogs.

575
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,775
This is to satisfy my curiosity.

576
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,216
I'm still leaving
at the end of the week.

577
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,097
Aw, shit. Wait, wait.

578
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,330
Gould's wife was out of town,

579
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,490
except this means
she saw something.

580
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,411
What if it's a threat?

581
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,889
I put her in a safe house.

582
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,811
She wasn't happy about it.

583
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,337
What if it isn't
something she has seen

584
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,934
but something
she's supposed to see

585
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,488
but hasn't been given a chance?

586
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,252
Yeah, OK. What?

587
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,092
I don't know.

588
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,736
But that's the one thing.

589
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,338
Sign us in.

590
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,854
We've got to see Mrs Gould.

591
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,296
We want you to have
a phone line, but...

592
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,338
Mrs Gould?

593
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,131
Mrs Gould, I am sorry.

594
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,494
I truly am.

595
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,969
I don't understand.

596
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,779
I need you to look at each photo

597
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,657
very carefully.

598
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,379
Look and see if there's anything

599
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,496
strange or out of place,

600
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,979
anything at all.

601
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,176
I don't see anything.

602
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:13,897
You sure?

603
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,494
I can't do this right now!

604
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,808
OK.

605
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,130
It's got to be now.

606
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,780
There may be something
we haven't seen.

607
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,339
Wait.

608
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,296
What?

609
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,779
Here.

610
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,613
This painting, it's upside down.

611
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,337
Your men didn't move this?

612
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,819
No, no, no.

613
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,175
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

614
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,691
Nothing.

615
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,419
There's got to be something.

616
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,653
Moved the screws to rehang it.

617
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,968
Yep.

618
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,893
What the fuck is that?

619
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,777
Switchblade.

620
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,416
Goddamn it!

621
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,530
Must be something.

622
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,699
He didn't paint
the fucking thing.

623
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,331
Now he's fucking with us.

624
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,251
That's what he's doing.

625
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,456
See this? This is us.

626
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,689
Yeah.

627
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,691
Just wait a minute.

628
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,849
Now Somerset's climbing
on the furniture.

629
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,817
Just wait a minute.

630
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,652
You're kidding me.

631
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,334
Call the print lab.

632
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,894
Oh, man.

633
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,650
Honestly, have you ever seen

634
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,378
anything like this?

635
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,211
No.

636
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,131
I can tell you guys

637
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,495
just by looking
at the swirl pattern,

638
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,775
they're not the victim's
fingerprints.

639
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,696
I don't know, man.

640
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,294
I'd say he's whacked enough.

641
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,699
Doesn't fit.

642
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,533
He doesn't want us
to help him stop.

643
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,099
Who knows?

644
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,375
Freaks out there
doing evil deeds

645
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,132
they don't want to do.

646
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,532
"Voices made me do it.
Jodie Foster told me to do it."

647
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,009
I've seen this take three days

648
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,658
to make a match,

649
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,449
so maybe you want to cross
your fingers somewhere else.

650
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,532
You meant what you said
to Mrs Gould, didn't you,

651
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,497
about catching this guy?

652
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,776
I wish I still thought
the way you do.

653
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,737
Why don't you tell me

654
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,651
what the hell it is

655
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,253
you think we're doing?

656
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,490
Picking up the pieces.

657
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,775
We're collecting
all the evidence,

658
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,658
taking all the pictures
and samples,

659
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,939
writing everything down,
noting the time things happen.

660
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,817
That's all?

661
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,379
That's all.

662
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,690
Putting everything
into neat little piles

663
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,577
and filing it away

664
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,139
on the off chance

665
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,017
it will ever be needed

666
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,977
in the courtroom.

667
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,891
Picking up diamonds

668
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,971
on a deserted island,

669
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,336
saving them in case
we get rescued.

670
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,173
Bullshit.

671
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,250
Even the most promising clues

672
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,093
usually only lead to others.

673
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,298
So many corpses
roll away unrevenged.

674
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,891
Don't try to tell me

675
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,175
you didn't get
that rush tonight.

676
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,091
I assure you.

677
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,455
We're getting somewhere.

678
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,055
Wake up, glimmer twins.

679
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,256
You've got a winner.

680
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,539
This guy goes by the name
of Victor.

681
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,850
His real name is Theodore Allen.

682
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,135
His prints were found
by homicide.

683
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,814
He's got a long history
of mental illness.

684
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,688
His parents gave him a strict
southern baptist upbringing,

685
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,736
but somewhere they fell short.

686
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,095
Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery, assault,

687
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,332
spent time in prison here
for attempted rape of a minor,

688
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,890
but his lawyer saw to it
that didn't last long.

689
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,211
His lawyer was Eli Gould,
the greed murder victim.

690
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,291
We're going
to finish this today.

691
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,177
Victor's been
out of circulation,

692
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,933
but there's still
a residence in his name.

693
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,295
You're not buying this, are you?

694
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,052
Doesn't seem like our guy.

695
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,459
You tell me.

696
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,293
Our killer seems
to have more purpose.

697
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,455
You ever take a bullet?

698
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,418
Never in my 34 years,
knock wood.

699
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,651
I've only taken
my gun out three times

700
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,935
with the intention of using it.

701
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,772
Never pulled the trigger.

702
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,213
Not once.

703
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,449
You?

704
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,657
Yeah, but... no,
I never took a bullet,

705
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,050
but I pulled my gun once,
shot it once.

706
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,209
Really?

707
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,973
Lt was my first one of these.

708
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,211
I was shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

709
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,372
We bust open the door
looking for this junkie,

710
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,212
and the fucker opened fire.

711
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,133
One cop got hit in the arm.

712
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,293
Christ, what was his name?

713
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,496
Spun him like a top.

714
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,538
You know? I mean,
more like slow motion.

715
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,215
I remember...

716
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,370
Riding in that ambulance.

717
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,372
Well, he died right there.

718
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,018
Right there.

719
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,819
Christ, what was
his fucking name?

720
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,529
Swat goes before dicks.

721
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,099
Here.

722
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,495
They love this.

723
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,933
Police!

724
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,019
Clear!

725
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,649
Clear!

726
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,217
Good morning, sweetheart.

727
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,416
Get up now, motherfucker.

728
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,172
Now!

729
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,768
Get up, you sack of shit.

730
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,459
Oh, fuck me.

731
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,814
Dicks!

732
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,858
You want to come
take a look at this!

733
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,173
Dicks!

734
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,814
Jesus.

735
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,174
Victor?

736
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,251
That's just Victor.

737
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,092
Call an ambulance.

738
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,454
A hearse.

739
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,054
Get your people out of here.

740
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,016
Go!

741
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,011
No one touches anything!

742
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,978
Some kind of freaking
wax sculpture or something.

743
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,777
"Sloth."

744
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,209
Oh, man.

745
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,528
Goddamn.

746
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:18,010
This picture was dated
three days ago.

747
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,572
This must be
the first one. Look.

748
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,777
It's dated exactly
one year ago today.

749
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:36,415
I got a hair sample,
a stool sample, piss.

750
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,456
I got fingernails.

751
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,579
He's laughing at us.

752
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,220
You got what you deserved.

753
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,214
He's alive! He's alive!

754
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,370
That cocksucker's alive!

755
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,658
Calm down! Emergency
on that ambulance!

756
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,098
He's playing games.

757
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,499
Ah, no shit.

758
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,137
We have to divorce
ourselves from emotion.

759
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,018
We have to remain
focused on the details.

760
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,658
I feed off my emotions.

761
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,968
Are you listening?

762
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,051
Yes, I can hear you.

763
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,414
Excuse me.

764
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,173
Closed crime scene.
Get the fuck out.

765
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,739
I got a right.

766
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,618
Get out of here, piece of shit!

767
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,099
Get out of here!

768
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,330
I got your picture, man.

769
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,457
Detective Mills.
M-i-I-I-s! Fuck off!

770
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,292
I'm surprised you can spell.

771
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,177
Fuck you!

772
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,172
How do they get here
so fucking quick?

773
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:50,730
They pay police for
the information and pay well.

774
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,697
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

775
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,372
I...

776
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,530
Well, he pissed me off.

777
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:00,499
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

778
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,451
A year of immobility
seems about right

779
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,134
judging by the deterioration
of the muscles in the spine.

780
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,973
Blood tests show many drugs
in his system,

781
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,334
even an antibiotic

782
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,650
which must have
been administered

783
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,537
to keep bedsores from infecting.

784
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,497
Has he tried to speak

785
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,411
or communicate in any way?

786
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,695
Even if his brain were not mush,

787
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,213
which it is,

788
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,497
he chewed off
his own tongue long ago.

789
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,969
Doctor.

790
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,937
Is there absolutely no chance

791
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,817
that he might survive?

792
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,095
Detective, he'd die
of shock right now

793
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,013
if you shined
a flashlight in his eyes.

794
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,853
He's experienced about
as much pain and suffering

795
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,773
as anyone I've encountered,
give or take,

796
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:52,216
and he still has hell
to look forward to.

797
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,619
Good night.

798
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,810
We bring you
the Charlie Parker Quintet,

799
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,334
featuring Charles Thompson on
piano, Herb Pomeroy's trumpet,

800
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,615
Jimmy Woode, bass,
Kenny Clarke, drums,

801
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,055
and the alto saxophone
of Charlie Parker.

802
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,573
Yeah.

803
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,934
Hello, William?

804
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,499
Lt's Tracy.

805
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,808
Tracy?

806
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,777
Ls everything all right?

807
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,657
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

808
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,219
Where's David?

809
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,451
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.

810
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,338
I'm sorry to call you like this.

811
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,853
Oh, it's all right.

812
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,818
What can I do for you, Tracy?

813
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,095
I, uh...

814
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,857
Um, I need someone to talk to.

815
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,693
Do you think you
could meet me...

816
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,248
somewhere maybe
tomorrow morning?

817
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,093
I don't understand.

818
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,410
I feel stupid calling,

819
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,491
but, uh...

820
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,890
you're the only person
that I know here.

821
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,857
There's no one else.

822
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,168
If you can,

823
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,694
just give me a call, OK?

824
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,975
I have to go now.

825
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,493
Good night.

826
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,730
Good night.

827
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,568
It can be a hard place.

828
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,979
I don't know

829
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,494
why I asked you to come.

830
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,299
Why don't you talk
to him about it?

831
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,257
Tell him how you feel.

832
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,491
I can't... you know,
I can't be a burden,

833
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,377
especially now.

834
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,251
I'll get used to things.

835
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,219
You know, I think
I just wanted to talk

836
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,292
to someone who's lived here
for a long time.

837
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,257
I mean upstate, you know,

838
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:51,015
it's a completely
different... environment.

839
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,738
Did David tell you
that I teach fifth grade?

840
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,299
Well, I did.

841
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,894
Uh, he mentioned it.

842
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,691
I'm going around,

843
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,578
you know, looking at schools,

844
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:11,174
but the conditions here...

845
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,012
are horrible.

846
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,657
What about primary schools?

847
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,213
I don't know.

848
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,370
Why don't you tell me

849
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,416
what's really
bothering you, Tracy?

850
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,936
David and I are
going to have a baby.

851
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,894
Oh, Tracy...

852
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,337
I don't think I'm...

853
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,173
I'm the one
to talk to about this.

854
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,579
I hate this city.

855
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,219
I had a relationship once.

856
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,098
It was very much
like a marriage.

857
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,812
We got pregnant.

858
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,580
This was a long time ago.

859
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,089
I remember getting up
one morning

860
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,410
and going to work,

861
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,889
just another day like any other

862
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,175
except it was the first day

863
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:17,093
after I knew
about... the pregnancy.

864
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,933
And I felt this fear

865
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,931
for the first time ever.

866
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,458
I remember thinking,

867
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,735
how can I bring a child

868
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,617
into a world like this

869
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,611
with all this around them?

870
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,458
I told her
I didn't want to have it...

871
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,971
And over the next few weeks,

872
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,494
I wore her down.

873
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,809
I want to have children.

874
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,570
I can tell you now...

875
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,457
I'm... I know...

876
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,735
I mean...

877
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,492
I'm positive

878
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,252
I made the right decision,

879
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,138
but there's not
a day that passes

880
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,494
that I don't wish

881
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,969
that I'd made
a different choice.

882
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,098
If you don't keep...

883
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,779
the baby -

884
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,818
I mean, if that's
your decision,

885
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,892
don't ever tell him
you were pregnant.

886
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,656
But if you choose
to have this baby,

887
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,573
you spoil that kid
every chance you get.

888
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,850
That's about all the advice

889
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,817
I can give you, Tracy.

890
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,008
I got to go.

891
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,499
William.

892
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,179
Thank you.

893
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,772
Victor's landlord said

894
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,454
there was cash in
the office mailbox

895
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,451
the first of every month.

896
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,015
"I never heard
a single complaint

897
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,898
"from the tenant
in apartment 306,

898
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,414
"and nobody ever
complained about him.

899
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,378
"He was the best tenant
I've ever had."

900
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,734
Yeah, a landlord's dream -

901
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,731
a paralyzed tenant
with no tongue.

902
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,539
Who pays the rent on time.

903
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,258
I'm sick of all this waiting.

904
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,251
This is the job.

905
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,171
Why aren't we out there?

906
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,694
Why do we sit here rotting,

907
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,533
waiting till
the lunatic does it again?

908
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,973
That's dismissive.

909
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,175
Don't make that mistake.

910
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,728
Come on. He's insane. Look.

911
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,254
Right now, he's probably
dancing around

912
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,853
in his grandma's panties,

913
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,090
yeah, rubbing himself
in peanut butter.

914
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,057
Ooh, how's that?

915
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:14,290
I don't think so.

916
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,133
Yeah, his luck will run out.

917
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,176
He's not depending on luck.

918
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,897
We walked into that apartment

919
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,413
exactly one year

920
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,695
after he tied Victor to the bed.

921
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,259
He wanted us to.

922
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,570
Don't know that for sure.

923
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,093
Oh, yes, we do.

924
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,408
This note he left,

925
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,139
his first words to us.

926
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,499
"...leads up to light."

927
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,696
Fuck him. So what?

928
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,008
He's right so far.

929
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,977
Imagine the will it takes

930
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:51,416
to keep a man bound
for a full year,

931
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,254
to sever his hand and use it
to plant fingerprints,

932
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,729
to insert tubes
into his genitals.

933
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,253
This guy's methodical,

934
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,776
exacting, and worst
of all, patient.

935
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,293
He's a nut-bag.

936
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,974
Just because the fucker's
got a library card,

937
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,379
doesn't make him yoda.

938
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,017
How much money you got?

939
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,489
I got, like, 50. 50 bucks.

940
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,855
I propose a field trip.
Come on.

941
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,019
We'll make a list.

942
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,172
At the top we'll put
Purgatory, Canterbury Tales,

943
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:29,093
anything relating
to the seven deadly sins.

944
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,375
Ask yourself,
what would he study

945
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,849
to do the things he's done?

946
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,817
What are his interests now?

947
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,128
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

948
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,858
Where are we going?

949
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,816
The library.

950
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,056
Coupons! Coupons!

951
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:55,971
Free coupons. Discount...

952
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,698
Discount coupons!

953
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,533
They must have had
about 50 health violations

954
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,338
during their last inspection.

955
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,173
Could you at least
sit across from me?

956
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,093
I don't want people
thinking we're dating.

957
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,977
Give me your money.

958
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,891
I'm giving you this,

959
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,778
but I ought to know
what we're doing.

960
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,653
Fuck.

961
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,537
Hey, Somerset. How are you?

962
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:21,814
OK.

963
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,777
I didn't expect
a mnage trois.

964
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:26,169
It's not a problem. Sit down.

965
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,854
Only for you do I do this.

966
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,373
It's a big risk.

967
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,257
We're just fair and square.

968
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:37,568
It's a deal.

969
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,218
All right.

970
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,979
About an hour.

971
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,693
Yeah, help yourself.

972
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,857
Well, that was
money well spent.

973
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,419
Yeah.

974
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:03,134
All right.

975
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,699
By telling you this,

976
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,975
I'm trusting you
more than most people.

977
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:10,450
Good, because I'm
about ready to punch you.

978
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:11,768
It's probably nothing,

979
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,375
but it's no skin
off our teeth.

980
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:19,175
The guy in the pizza parlour

981
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,376
is a friend from the Bureau.

982
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,371
Who? Stinky man?

983
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,939
For years, the FBI

984
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,818
has been hooked into
the library system,

985
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,049
keeping records.

986
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,573
Mm-hmm. Assessing fines.

987
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,888
No, monitoring reading habits.

988
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,459
Look.

989
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,770
Certain books are flagged -

990
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,249
books on, say, nuclear weapons

991
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,614
or Mein Kampf.

992
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,498
Anyone who checks out
a flagged book

993
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:45,936
has his library records fed
into the FBl's computers.

994
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:47,851
Wait. How is this legal?

995
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,135
Legal, illegal -
these terms don't apply.

996
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,010
You can't use
the information directly.

997
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,897
It's just a useful guide.

998
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,459
It might sound silly,

999
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,338
but you can't get
a library card

1000
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,218
without an I.D.
And a phone bill.

1001
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,097
So they run a list.

1002
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,215
Precisely.

1003
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,973
If you want to know
who's reading

1004
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,379
Purgatory and Paradise Lost

1005
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,893
and Helter Skelter,

1006
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:14,255
the FBl's computers
will tell us.

1007
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,092
Could give us a name.

1008
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,410
It could get a college kid

1009
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,173
writing a term paper
on 20th-century crime.

1010
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,058
At least you're
out of the office.

1011
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,017
Get a haircut.

1012
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,534
How do you know all this?

1013
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,451
I don't. Neither do you.

1014
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,768
Exactly.

1015
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,978
The Divine Comedy,

1016
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,937
History of Catholicism.

1017
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,978
There's a book called
Murderers and Madmen.

1018
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:47,288
Modern Homicide Investigation,

1019
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,813
In Cold Blood,

1020
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,618
Of Human Bondage.

1021
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:51,576
Bondage?

1022
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,457
Not what you're thinking.

1023
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,019
The Marquis de Sharday.

1024
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,931
It's the Marquis de Sade.

1025
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,248
Whatever.

1026
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,774
The writings of
Saint Thomas Aqua-something.

1027
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,134
Saint Thomas Aquinas.

1028
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,973
He wrote about
the seven deadly sins.

1029
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,539
Is that it?

1030
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,417
Yeah.

1031
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,774
Let's try it.

1032
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,339
Jonathan Doe?

1033
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,773
Whatever.

1034
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,657
We're sure about that name?

1035
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,139
Yeah.

1036
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:19,371
You saw the list. John Doe.

1037
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,610
Let's take a look at him.

1038
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,053
Talk to him.

1039
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,414
This is crazy.

1040
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,889
Ah, we'll just talk to him.

1041
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,208
Excuse me, sir,

1042
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,258
are you, by any chance,
a serial killer?

1043
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:33,929
OK.

1044
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,897
You do the talking.

1045
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,369
Put that silver tongue to work.

1046
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:41,293
Have you been talking
to my wife?

1047
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,257
This is retarded.

1048
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,296
Charlie's fucking Angels.

1049
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,098
Name off a computer.

1050
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,696
Mills.

1051
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,973
You're hit.

1052
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,379
No.

1053
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,375
He's going down!
He's going down!

1054
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,212
Fifth floor!

1055
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,733
Mills.

1056
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,171
Mommy!

1057
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,251
Mommy!

1058
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,776
Police. Is there a back exit?

1059
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,293
Lock your door.

1060
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,859
What's going on?

1061
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:58,932
Get out of
the fucking hall, please.

1062
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,095
Get down!

1063
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,658
Get the fuck down!

1064
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,219
Shit.

1065
01:09:00,785 --> 01:09:02,013
Goddamn it!

1066
01:09:11,945 --> 01:09:13,424
Fuck.

1067
01:09:33,825 --> 01:09:35,622
Taxi!

1068
01:10:01,705 --> 01:10:04,503
Get out of
the fucking way! Move!

1069
01:11:02,385 --> 01:11:03,454
Mills!

1070
01:11:05,025 --> 01:11:06,344
No!

1071
01:11:26,025 --> 01:11:27,504
Mills?

1072
01:11:29,505 --> 01:11:30,733
Mills.

1073
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:32,304
Are you OK?

1074
01:11:32,385 --> 01:11:34,182
I'm all right.

1075
01:11:34,265 --> 01:11:36,176
I'm all right.

1076
01:11:39,905 --> 01:11:41,338
Where are you going?

1077
01:11:41,425 --> 01:11:42,653
I'm going in.

1078
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:44,224
Wait, wait, wait.

1079
01:11:44,305 --> 01:11:45,135
Wait!

1080
01:11:45,225 --> 01:11:47,056
What are you talking about?

1081
01:11:47,145 --> 01:11:48,976
He fuckin' shot at us.

1082
01:11:49,065 --> 01:11:51,454
We can't go in.
We need a warrant.

1083
01:11:51,545 --> 01:11:52,819
We got probable cause.

1084
01:11:52,905 --> 01:11:55,339
Think. How did we get here?

1085
01:11:55,425 --> 01:11:56,653
I can't tell anyone.

1086
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:59,134
I can't tell about the Bureau.

1087
01:11:59,225 --> 01:12:01,455
We have no reason to be here.

1088
01:12:01,545 --> 01:12:02,978
Listen to me.

1089
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:04,896
Get the fuck off me!

1090
01:12:04,985 --> 01:12:07,215
I'm sorry,
but just pay attention.

1091
01:12:07,305 --> 01:12:10,058
If we leave a hole like this,

1092
01:12:10,145 --> 01:12:12,613
we can't prosecute.
The guy will walk.

1093
01:12:12,705 --> 01:12:14,502
Is that what you want?

1094
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:16,416
By the time
we get the warrant...

1095
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:17,779
Nah, fuck that! No!

1096
01:12:17,865 --> 01:12:21,221
We need a reason
to knock on this door!

1097
01:12:21,305 --> 01:12:22,579
Think about it!

1098
01:12:24,585 --> 01:12:26,064
OK.

1099
01:12:28,025 --> 01:12:29,253
OK.

1100
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,778
OK, you're right.

1101
01:12:30,865 --> 01:12:32,184
I'm all fucked up.

1102
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:33,744
You're right. You're right.

1103
01:12:42,385 --> 01:12:43,704
Well.

1104
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:46,538
No point
in arguing any more...

1105
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:48,741
unless you can fix that.

1106
01:12:50,465 --> 01:12:52,899
You stupid son of a...

1107
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:03,014
How much money we got left?

1108
01:13:03,105 --> 01:13:05,903
So, yeah, like,
I noticed this guy

1109
01:13:05,985 --> 01:13:09,136
going out a lot
when the murders was happening,

1110
01:13:09,225 --> 01:13:10,658
and so I, um...

1111
01:13:10,745 --> 01:13:12,019
You called Detective Somerset,

1112
01:13:12,105 --> 01:13:13,379
right?

1113
01:13:13,465 --> 01:13:15,899
Right, so I called
the detective

1114
01:13:15,985 --> 01:13:17,418
because he looked creepy

1115
01:13:17,505 --> 01:13:20,099
and one of the murders
happened right over there.

1116
01:13:20,185 --> 01:13:21,698
OK, OK, OK...

1117
01:13:21,785 --> 01:13:23,582
I told you the rest.

1118
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,701
You have to sign it.

1119
01:13:25,785 --> 01:13:27,662
OK.

1120
01:13:27,745 --> 01:13:29,019
All right.

1121
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:30,538
You did good.

1122
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:32,456
I did what you said.

1123
01:13:32,545 --> 01:13:34,536
Here. You get something to eat.

1124
01:13:38,065 --> 01:13:39,418
Everybody stay outside.

1125
01:14:38,665 --> 01:14:40,098
Victor.

1126
01:16:28,265 --> 01:16:29,744
Fuck.

1127
01:16:47,425 --> 01:16:50,383
Somerset!

1128
01:16:51,385 --> 01:16:53,103
Somerset!

1129
01:16:53,185 --> 01:16:54,698
Yeah.

1130
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:58,853
What?

1131
01:16:58,945 --> 01:17:00,424
We had him.

1132
01:17:00,505 --> 01:17:02,302
What are you talking about?

1133
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:04,262
Lt was the fucking photographer

1134
01:17:04,345 --> 01:17:05,619
on the fucking stairs.

1135
01:17:09,985 --> 01:17:12,260
We had him, and we let him go.

1136
01:17:18,505 --> 01:17:20,257
You're sure this is him?

1137
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:21,858
Yeah. Good, good.

1138
01:17:21,945 --> 01:17:23,173
Uh, yeah. Good.

1139
01:17:23,265 --> 01:17:25,654
We've got nothing to go on.

1140
01:17:25,745 --> 01:17:27,975
No address books.
Just this receipt.

1141
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:29,657
Then keep looking.

1142
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,303
This was under the bed -

1143
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:32,579
his only source of funds.

1144
01:17:32,665 --> 01:17:34,098
We got his money.

1145
01:17:34,185 --> 01:17:35,413
Fucking-A, good work.

1146
01:17:35,505 --> 01:17:37,973
One more thing
you won't believe.

1147
01:17:38,065 --> 01:17:40,215
We haven't found
a fingerprint, not one.

1148
01:17:40,305 --> 01:17:43,217
You're right. I don't
believe you. Keep looking.

1149
01:17:46,945 --> 01:17:48,936
We could use some more men.

1150
01:17:49,025 --> 01:17:51,414
I'm doing the best I can.

1151
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:52,733
What's all this?

1152
01:17:52,825 --> 01:17:55,385
There are 2,000 notebooks
on these shelves.

1153
01:17:55,465 --> 01:17:57,296
Each contains about 250 pages.

1154
01:17:57,385 --> 01:18:00,104
Forget it. Anything
about the killings?

1155
01:18:00,185 --> 01:18:02,062
"What sick puppets we are.

1156
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:04,534
"What a gross stage we dance on.

1157
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:06,661
"What fun we have
dancing, fucking.

1158
01:18:06,745 --> 01:18:08,497
"Not a care in the world,

1159
01:18:08,585 --> 01:18:10,223
"not knowing
that we are nothing.

1160
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:12,057
"We are not what was intended."

1161
01:18:12,145 --> 01:18:14,943
No, wait. There's a lot more.

1162
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:16,299
"On the subway today,

1163
01:18:16,385 --> 01:18:19,263
"a man started
a conversation with me.

1164
01:18:19,345 --> 01:18:20,619
"He made small talk.

1165
01:18:20,705 --> 01:18:23,458
"A lonely man talking
about the weather.

1166
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:24,773
"I tried to be pleasant,

1167
01:18:24,865 --> 01:18:28,062
"but my head began to hurt
from his banality,

1168
01:18:28,145 --> 01:18:30,739
"I almost didn't notice
it had happened,

1169
01:18:30,825 --> 01:18:33,578
"but I suddenly threw up
all over him.

1170
01:18:33,665 --> 01:18:35,417
"He was not pleased,

1171
01:18:35,505 --> 01:18:38,338
"and I couldn't stop laughing."

1172
01:18:38,425 --> 01:18:39,858
No dates.

1173
01:18:39,945 --> 01:18:44,097
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

1174
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:47,541
Just his mind
poured out on paper.

1175
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:49,422
Looks like a life's work.

1176
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:52,895
Even with 50 men,
it would take 2 months.

1177
01:18:52,985 --> 01:18:55,419
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1178
01:18:57,985 --> 01:18:59,737
Where's that phone?

1179
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:05,783
Phone? Phone? Phone?

1180
01:19:08,185 --> 01:19:09,937
People, quiet!

1181
01:19:24,465 --> 01:19:25,898
Hello.

1182
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:27,259
I admire you.

1183
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,654
I don't know how you found me,

1184
01:19:29,745 --> 01:19:31,098
but imagine my surprise.

1185
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:34,939
I respect you law enforcement
agents more every day.

1186
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:37,585
Well, I appreciate
that... John.

1187
01:19:37,665 --> 01:19:38,939
I tell you...

1188
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:41,300
No, you listen.
I'll be readjusting my schedule

1189
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:43,580
in light
of today's little... setback.

1190
01:19:43,665 --> 01:19:46,463
I just had
to express my admiration.

1191
01:19:46,545 --> 01:19:49,343
I'm sorry I had
to hurt one of you,

1192
01:19:49,425 --> 01:19:52,223
but I didn't have
a choice, did I?

1193
01:19:52,305 --> 01:19:54,136
You will accept my apology?

1194
01:19:54,225 --> 01:19:56,978
I would say more,
but I'd ruin the surprise.

1195
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:02,376
I'll be readjusting my schedule

1196
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:04,296
in light
of today's little... setback.

1197
01:20:04,385 --> 01:20:05,704
Got it.

1198
01:20:09,545 --> 01:20:11,695
All right,
everybody back to work.

1199
01:20:13,585 --> 01:20:16,577
You were right. He's preaching.

1200
01:20:16,665 --> 01:20:20,977
Yeah. These murders
are his sermons to us.

1201
01:20:21,065 --> 01:20:22,498
Look, we know him,

1202
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:24,496
we know him, we know him.

1203
01:20:26,825 --> 01:20:28,543
Who's the blonde?

1204
01:20:32,705 --> 01:20:34,423
Looks like a pro.

1205
01:20:34,505 --> 01:20:37,338
Maybe... she caught
John Doe's eye.

1206
01:20:42,745 --> 01:20:44,975
He collected it last night.

1207
01:20:45,065 --> 01:20:46,464
Last night?

1208
01:20:46,545 --> 01:20:48,024
This man?

1209
01:20:48,105 --> 01:20:50,858
Yeah. John Doe. He had a limp.

1210
01:20:50,945 --> 01:20:53,778
What was the job
you did for him?

1211
01:20:53,865 --> 01:20:56,459
I've got a picture.
One sweet piece.

1212
01:20:56,545 --> 01:20:57,864
I thought he was

1213
01:20:57,945 --> 01:20:59,663
one of them
performance artists,

1214
01:20:59,745 --> 01:21:01,701
the sort of guy

1215
01:21:01,785 --> 01:21:05,573
that pisses in a cap
onstage and then drinks it.

1216
01:21:05,665 --> 01:21:07,144
Performance art.

1217
01:21:07,225 --> 01:21:08,453
Yeah.

1218
01:21:11,345 --> 01:21:13,461
I think I undercharged him,
actually.

1219
01:21:13,545 --> 01:21:15,615
You made this for him?

1220
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:18,538
I've made weirder shit
than that. So what?

1221
01:21:22,865 --> 01:21:24,776
They found the blonde.

1222
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:29,058
The picture.

1223
01:21:29,145 --> 01:21:30,294
The picture!

1224
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:33,377
Fucking pigs!

1225
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:40,218
Get the fuck
out of the booth, pal!

1226
01:21:40,305 --> 01:21:43,502
I've been in this cage
the whole time, OK?

1227
01:21:43,585 --> 01:21:45,496
Come on. This way!

1228
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:53,458
Can you do something
about this music?

1229
01:21:53,545 --> 01:21:56,901
We're working on it.
We're looking for the guy.

1230
01:22:08,305 --> 01:22:11,854
You from homicide?
You better see this.

1231
01:22:11,945 --> 01:22:13,856
Stay still, all right?

1232
01:22:20,985 --> 01:22:23,818
God, get this thing off of me!

1233
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,896
Get him out of here now.

1234
01:22:25,985 --> 01:22:28,545
Get him out of here now!

1235
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:31,822
Come on. I want
to hear it again.

1236
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,463
Tell me again.

1237
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:36,943
You heard nothing strange?

1238
01:22:37,025 --> 01:22:38,458
You saw nothing strange?

1239
01:22:38,545 --> 01:22:39,694
No.

1240
01:22:39,785 --> 01:22:42,015
No.

1241
01:22:42,105 --> 01:22:45,461
He asked if I was married.
He had a gun.

1242
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:46,944
Where was the girl?

1243
01:22:47,025 --> 01:22:49,380
The what? What?

1244
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,854
The girl. The prostitute.
Where was she?

1245
01:22:51,945 --> 01:22:53,663
Someone comes
to your establishment,

1246
01:22:53,745 --> 01:22:55,463
they want to go downstairs

1247
01:22:55,545 --> 01:22:58,218
to get a little
ooh-la-la, whatever,

1248
01:22:58,305 --> 01:23:01,263
they got to come to you, yeah?

1249
01:23:01,345 --> 01:23:02,221
Yeah.

1250
01:23:02,305 --> 01:23:05,058
You didn't see anyone
with a package,

1251
01:23:05,145 --> 01:23:07,579
a knapsack,
something under their arm?

1252
01:23:07,665 --> 01:23:09,815
Hey, everybody
that comes in there

1253
01:23:09,905 --> 01:23:12,863
has got a package
under their arms.

1254
01:23:12,945 --> 01:23:15,539
Some guys are carrying
suitcases full of stuff.

1255
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:16,899
She was just...

1256
01:23:16,985 --> 01:23:19,977
She was just
sitting on the bed.

1257
01:23:23,305 --> 01:23:26,661
Who tied her down, you or him?

1258
01:23:26,745 --> 01:23:30,021
Do you like what
you do for a living?

1259
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:32,619
No.

1260
01:23:32,705 --> 01:23:34,536
No, I don't.

1261
01:23:35,785 --> 01:23:38,663
But that's life, isn't it?

1262
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:44,901
He... he... He had a gun,

1263
01:23:44,985 --> 01:23:48,102
and... and he made it happen.

1264
01:23:49,505 --> 01:23:51,894
He made me do it.

1265
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:55,057
He... he put that thing on me.

1266
01:23:55,145 --> 01:23:57,613
Then he made me wear it.

1267
01:23:57,705 --> 01:24:00,902
Then he... he... told
me to fuck her.

1268
01:24:02,905 --> 01:24:05,135
And I did. I fucked her!

1269
01:24:05,225 --> 01:24:07,420
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1270
01:24:07,505 --> 01:24:10,303
He had a gun in my mouth.

1271
01:24:10,385 --> 01:24:13,104
The fucking gun
was in my throat!

1272
01:24:13,185 --> 01:24:15,016
Fuck!

1273
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:18,498
Oh, God! God!

1274
01:24:18,585 --> 01:24:20,462
God, help me. Please.

1275
01:24:20,545 --> 01:24:22,024
Please help me!

1276
01:24:22,105 --> 01:24:23,618
Please help me!

1277
01:24:39,145 --> 01:24:41,739
This isn't going
to have a happy ending.

1278
01:24:41,825 --> 01:24:45,420
Hey, man. We catch him,
I'll be happy enough.

1279
01:24:48,305 --> 01:24:50,341
If we catch John Doe

1280
01:24:50,425 --> 01:24:53,576
and he turns out
to be Satan himself,

1281
01:24:53,665 --> 01:24:56,463
that might live up
to our expectations,

1282
01:24:56,545 --> 01:24:58,979
but he's not the devil.

1283
01:24:59,065 --> 01:25:00,942
He's just a man.

1284
01:25:01,025 --> 01:25:03,858
You know, you bitch
and you complain

1285
01:25:03,945 --> 01:25:06,220
and tell me these things and...

1286
01:25:06,305 --> 01:25:07,818
If you think

1287
01:25:07,905 --> 01:25:10,214
you're preparing me
for hard times,

1288
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:11,579
thank you, but...

1289
01:25:11,665 --> 01:25:14,463
But you got to be a hero.

1290
01:25:14,545 --> 01:25:16,775
You want to be a champion.

1291
01:25:16,865 --> 01:25:18,662
People don't want a champion.

1292
01:25:18,745 --> 01:25:20,576
They want to eat cheeseburgers

1293
01:25:20,665 --> 01:25:22,064
and watch television.

1294
01:25:22,145 --> 01:25:25,182
How did you get like this?
I want to know.

1295
01:25:25,265 --> 01:25:26,698
Well...

1296
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:31,535
It wasn't one thing,
I can tell you that.

1297
01:25:32,745 --> 01:25:34,224
Go on.

1298
01:25:36,105 --> 01:25:38,778
I just don't think
I can continue

1299
01:25:38,865 --> 01:25:41,584
to live in a place
that embraces apathy

1300
01:25:41,665 --> 01:25:44,020
as if it was a virtue.

1301
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:46,016
You're no different, no better.

1302
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:48,903
I didn't say I was. I'm not.

1303
01:25:48,985 --> 01:25:50,259
Hell, I sympathise.

1304
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:51,778
I sympathise completely.

1305
01:25:51,865 --> 01:25:53,457
Apathy is a solution.

1306
01:25:53,545 --> 01:25:55,137
I mean, it's easier

1307
01:25:55,225 --> 01:25:57,022
to lose yourself in drugs

1308
01:25:57,105 --> 01:25:59,824
than it is to cope with life.

1309
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,738
It's easier to steal
what you want.

1310
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:06,056
It's easier to beat
a child than raise it.

1311
01:26:06,145 --> 01:26:08,181
Hell, love costs,
takes effort, work.

1312
01:26:08,265 --> 01:26:11,337
We are talking about people
who are mentally ill,

1313
01:26:11,425 --> 01:26:13,177
people who are fucking crazies.

1314
01:26:13,265 --> 01:26:14,380
No.

1315
01:26:14,465 --> 01:26:15,614
Yes.

1316
01:26:15,705 --> 01:26:17,935
We're talking about
everyday life here.

1317
01:26:18,025 --> 01:26:20,778
You can't afford
to be this nave.

1318
01:26:20,865 --> 01:26:22,662
Fuck off.

1319
01:26:22,745 --> 01:26:24,383
Gee.

1320
01:26:24,465 --> 01:26:26,501
You should listen to yourself.

1321
01:26:26,585 --> 01:26:31,181
You say, "The problem with
people is that they don't care,

1322
01:26:31,265 --> 01:26:33,938
so I don't care about people."

1323
01:26:34,025 --> 01:26:35,856
That makes no sense.

1324
01:26:35,945 --> 01:26:37,173
You care?

1325
01:26:37,265 --> 01:26:39,142
Damn right.

1326
01:26:39,225 --> 01:26:41,739
And you're going
to make a difference.

1327
01:26:41,825 --> 01:26:43,304
Whatever. The point is,

1328
01:26:43,385 --> 01:26:46,104
is that I don't
think you're quitting

1329
01:26:46,185 --> 01:26:47,823
because you believe
these things.

1330
01:26:47,905 --> 01:26:49,577
You want to believe them

1331
01:26:49,665 --> 01:26:51,496
because you're quitting.

1332
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:54,383
You want me to agree with you

1333
01:26:54,465 --> 01:26:56,296
and say, "Yeah, you're right.

1334
01:26:56,385 --> 01:26:59,183
"Lt's all fucked up.
It's a fucking mess.

1335
01:26:59,265 --> 01:27:01,062
"We should all go live

1336
01:27:01,145 --> 01:27:03,022
"in a fucking log cabin."

1337
01:27:03,105 --> 01:27:04,936
But I won't.

1338
01:27:05,025 --> 01:27:06,697
I won't say that.

1339
01:27:06,785 --> 01:27:08,616
I don't agree with you.

1340
01:27:08,705 --> 01:27:10,343
I do not.

1341
01:27:12,705 --> 01:27:14,343
I can't.

1342
01:27:23,945 --> 01:27:26,061
I'm going to go home.

1343
01:27:33,545 --> 01:27:35,103
Thank you, though.

1344
01:28:04,225 --> 01:28:06,056
I love you, honey,

1345
01:28:06,145 --> 01:28:07,976
so much.

1346
01:28:09,465 --> 01:28:11,535
So much.

1347
01:28:15,905 --> 01:28:18,180
I know.

1348
01:29:16,265 --> 01:29:21,385
911. What's your emergency?
Could you repeat that?

1349
01:29:21,465 --> 01:29:24,696
I've gone and done it again.

1350
01:29:33,825 --> 01:29:35,577
What have you got?

1351
01:29:35,665 --> 01:29:38,623
Sleeping pills...

1352
01:29:38,705 --> 01:29:40,184
Glued to one hand.

1353
01:29:40,265 --> 01:29:43,416
Telephone glued to the other.

1354
01:29:43,505 --> 01:29:44,824
You see what he did?

1355
01:29:44,905 --> 01:29:47,135
He sliced her up...

1356
01:29:47,225 --> 01:29:49,181
Then he bandaged her.

1357
01:29:49,265 --> 01:29:51,699
Call for help, and you'll live

1358
01:29:51,785 --> 01:29:53,264
but you'll be disfigured,

1359
01:29:53,345 --> 01:29:55,301
or you can put yourself

1360
01:29:55,385 --> 01:29:57,774
out of your own misery.

1361
01:29:57,865 --> 01:29:59,218
Come on.

1362
01:29:59,305 --> 01:30:01,375
Cut off her nose.

1363
01:30:01,465 --> 01:30:03,057
To spite her face.

1364
01:30:03,145 --> 01:30:06,137
He did it very recently.

1365
01:30:11,825 --> 01:30:14,498
Listen, I've decided to stay on

1366
01:30:14,585 --> 01:30:16,098
till this is done.

1367
01:30:16,185 --> 01:30:18,494
One of two things will happen.

1368
01:30:18,585 --> 01:30:21,702
Either we'll get John Doe,
or he'll finish his seven

1369
01:30:21,785 --> 01:30:24,174
and this case will
go on for years.

1370
01:30:24,265 --> 01:30:27,860
You don't have
to do me any favours.

1371
01:30:27,945 --> 01:30:30,618
Keep me as your partner
a few days.

1372
01:30:30,705 --> 01:30:32,900
You'll be doing me a favour.

1373
01:30:42,425 --> 01:30:45,576
You knew I'd say yes.
Hey, we're here.

1374
01:30:45,665 --> 01:30:50,181
Your wife called.
Get an answering machine.

1375
01:30:50,265 --> 01:30:52,733
Detective.

1376
01:30:54,025 --> 01:30:55,378
After this, I'm gone.

1377
01:30:55,465 --> 01:30:56,784
Detective.

1378
01:30:56,865 --> 01:30:58,014
No big surprise.

1379
01:30:58,105 --> 01:31:00,141
Detective!

1380
01:31:01,385 --> 01:31:03,376
You're looking for me.

1381
01:31:05,985 --> 01:31:08,374
Don't fucking move!
On the floor!

1382
01:31:08,465 --> 01:31:10,342
Keep away from him!

1383
01:31:10,425 --> 01:31:11,574
I know you.

1384
01:31:11,665 --> 01:31:13,223
Now! Get down!

1385
01:31:13,305 --> 01:31:15,057
Get down! On your stomach!

1386
01:31:15,145 --> 01:31:16,863
You piece of shit!

1387
01:31:16,945 --> 01:31:18,981
Now! All the way!

1388
01:31:19,065 --> 01:31:20,578
All the way, fucker!

1389
01:31:20,665 --> 01:31:21,780
Down! Faster! Faster!

1390
01:31:21,865 --> 01:31:23,821
Faster, fucker! Now!

1391
01:31:23,905 --> 01:31:25,975
Nose on the ground!

1392
01:31:28,705 --> 01:31:29,933
Jesus Christ.

1393
01:31:30,025 --> 01:31:31,856
What the fuck is this?

1394
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:35,017
I'd like to speak
to my lawyer, please.

1395
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:39,219
Goddamn it!

1396
01:31:39,305 --> 01:31:42,377
He cuts the skin
off his fingers.

1397
01:31:42,465 --> 01:31:45,901
That's why we couldn't find
one usable print.

1398
01:31:45,985 --> 01:31:48,658
He's been doing it
for quite some time.

1399
01:31:48,745 --> 01:31:51,896
What about the trace
on his bank accounts?

1400
01:31:51,985 --> 01:31:54,294
So far everything's a dead end.

1401
01:31:54,385 --> 01:31:56,182
No credit history,
no employment records.

1402
01:31:56,265 --> 01:31:59,337
His bank account's
only five years old.

1403
01:31:59,425 --> 01:32:01,222
It was started with cash.

1404
01:32:01,305 --> 01:32:03,296
The only thing we know

1405
01:32:03,385 --> 01:32:05,182
about that guy right now

1406
01:32:05,265 --> 01:32:07,699
is he's independently wealthy,
well-educated,

1407
01:32:07,785 --> 01:32:09,059
and totally insane.

1408
01:32:09,145 --> 01:32:10,976
He's John Doe by choice.

1409
01:32:11,065 --> 01:32:13,021
When do we question him?

1410
01:32:13,105 --> 01:32:15,903
You don't.
He's going to court now.

1411
01:32:15,985 --> 01:32:18,579
There's no way he would
turn himself in.

1412
01:32:18,665 --> 01:32:20,496
It doesn't make sense.

1413
01:32:20,585 --> 01:32:23,577
It's not supposed to make sense.

1414
01:32:23,665 --> 01:32:25,178
He's not finished.

1415
01:32:25,265 --> 01:32:27,938
No, he's just
pissing in our faces.

1416
01:32:28,025 --> 01:32:30,493
You know what I'm talking about.

1417
01:32:30,585 --> 01:32:32,621
For the first time ever,

1418
01:32:32,705 --> 01:32:35,777
you and I are
in total agreement.

1419
01:32:35,865 --> 01:32:37,617
So what the fuck, man?

1420
01:32:37,705 --> 01:32:39,502
He's two murders away

1421
01:32:39,585 --> 01:32:41,257
from completing his masterpiece.

1422
01:32:41,345 --> 01:32:44,576
We'll wait for his plea.

1423
01:32:47,345 --> 01:32:50,064
My client says there are
two more bodies. Hidden away.

1424
01:32:50,145 --> 01:32:54,377
He will take Detectives Mills
and Somerset to these bodies,

1425
01:32:54,465 --> 01:32:56,820
but only Detective
Mills and Somerset,

1426
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:58,782
only at 6:00 today.

1427
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:00,014
Why us?

1428
01:33:00,105 --> 01:33:02,255
He says he admires you.

1429
01:33:02,345 --> 01:33:05,223
It's part of the game.

1430
01:33:05,305 --> 01:33:07,614
My client claims that if
the detectives do not accept,

1431
01:33:07,705 --> 01:33:10,014
these bodies
will never be found.

1432
01:33:10,105 --> 01:33:12,903
Frankly, counsel,
I'm inclined to let them rot.

1433
01:33:12,985 --> 01:33:14,577
Hey, we've got him

1434
01:33:14,665 --> 01:33:16,462
downstairs,
locked up, done deal.

1435
01:33:16,545 --> 01:33:19,855
He's going to get free
room and board, cable TV.

1436
01:33:19,945 --> 01:33:22,778
Hell, my wife doesn't
even have cable.

1437
01:33:22,865 --> 01:33:24,184
Mills!

1438
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:25,539
Hey, something stinks.

1439
01:33:25,625 --> 01:33:27,217
And this one here...

1440
01:33:27,305 --> 01:33:29,535
Yeah, you, in your $3,000 suit

1441
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:32,378
and that smug smile,
dealing for that shit...

1442
01:33:32,465 --> 01:33:33,614
Mills!

1443
01:33:33,705 --> 01:33:35,582
I am required by law
to serve my clients.

1444
01:33:35,665 --> 01:33:37,144
Ah, Jesus Christ.

1445
01:33:37,225 --> 01:33:38,943
To serve their best interests.

1446
01:33:39,025 --> 01:33:41,220
We don't make deals here.

1447
01:33:41,305 --> 01:33:43,773
My client says if
you do not accept,

1448
01:33:43,865 --> 01:33:45,503
he will plead insanity.

1449
01:33:45,585 --> 01:33:49,419
Let him try it.
I'd like to see him try.

1450
01:33:49,505 --> 01:33:51,575
With the nature of these crimes,

1451
01:33:51,665 --> 01:33:54,862
I could get him off
with such a plea.

1452
01:33:54,945 --> 01:33:57,220
I'm not letting
this conviction slide.

1453
01:33:57,305 --> 01:34:00,103
He says that if you do accept,

1454
01:34:00,185 --> 01:34:02,301
he will sign a full confession,

1455
01:34:02,385 --> 01:34:04,023
plead guilty right now.

1456
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:06,380
It's your case. Make a decision.

1457
01:34:07,985 --> 01:34:10,658
Full confession. I'm in.

1458
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:13,464
It has to be the both of you.

1459
01:34:13,545 --> 01:34:16,184
If he were to claim insanity,

1460
01:34:16,265 --> 01:34:17,903
this conversation
is admissible -

1461
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:20,419
the fact that he's
blackmailing us.

1462
01:34:20,505 --> 01:34:23,781
My client would remind you,
two more are dead.

1463
01:34:23,865 --> 01:34:26,584
The press would have a field day

1464
01:34:26,665 --> 01:34:29,862
if the police didn't seem
concerned about finding them.

1465
01:34:29,945 --> 01:34:32,015
If there are two more dead.

1466
01:34:32,105 --> 01:34:33,743
The lab report came.

1467
01:34:33,825 --> 01:34:36,339
They did a quickie
on Doe's clothing.

1468
01:34:36,425 --> 01:34:39,701
They found blood from Doe
slicing his fingers,

1469
01:34:39,785 --> 01:34:43,255
blood from the woman
whose face he cut off,

1470
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:45,575
and blood from a third party,

1471
01:34:45,665 --> 01:34:47,144
as yet unidentified.

1472
01:34:49,505 --> 01:34:52,099
You'd be escorting
an unarmed man.

1473
01:34:54,585 --> 01:34:56,576
Let's finish it.

1474
01:34:59,385 --> 01:35:02,855
If John Doe's head opens
and a UFO flies out,

1475
01:35:02,945 --> 01:35:05,743
I want you to have expected it.

1476
01:35:07,265 --> 01:35:08,334
I will.

1477
01:35:09,945 --> 01:35:12,778
Hey, man, if I was
to accidentally

1478
01:35:12,865 --> 01:35:14,298
shave off a nipple,

1479
01:35:14,385 --> 01:35:17,263
would it be covered
by workman's comp?

1480
01:35:19,865 --> 01:35:21,298
I suppose so.

1481
01:35:21,385 --> 01:35:23,216
If you were man enough

1482
01:35:23,305 --> 01:35:25,136
to actually file a claim,

1483
01:35:25,225 --> 01:35:28,422
I'd buy you one
out of my own pocket.

1484
01:35:28,505 --> 01:35:30,223
I keep coming home late,

1485
01:35:30,305 --> 01:35:32,500
my wife's going
to think something's up.

1486
01:35:40,865 --> 01:35:43,254
You know...

1487
01:35:43,345 --> 01:35:44,698
Yeah.

1488
01:35:50,425 --> 01:35:51,824
What?

1489
01:36:59,745 --> 01:37:01,576
Let's go!

1490
01:37:32,825 --> 01:37:34,702
Spin it around!

1491
01:37:34,785 --> 01:37:36,013
There he is.

1492
01:37:36,105 --> 01:37:38,824
Late model
black sedan at 10:00.

1493
01:37:47,465 --> 01:37:48,978
Who are you, John?

1494
01:37:49,065 --> 01:37:50,942
Who are you really?

1495
01:37:51,985 --> 01:37:52,974
What do you mean?

1496
01:37:53,065 --> 01:37:54,942
At this stage,
what harm can it do

1497
01:37:55,025 --> 01:37:56,822
to tell us about yourself?

1498
01:37:56,905 --> 01:37:58,941
Who I am means
absolutely nothing.

1499
01:37:59,025 --> 01:38:02,335
You need to stay
on your left up here.

1500
01:38:05,745 --> 01:38:08,339
So where are we heading?

1501
01:38:08,425 --> 01:38:09,653
You'll see.

1502
01:38:09,745 --> 01:38:11,463
We're not just going to pick up

1503
01:38:11,545 --> 01:38:14,264
two more dead bodies,
are we, John?

1504
01:38:14,345 --> 01:38:15,983
That wouldn't be
shocking enough.

1505
01:38:16,065 --> 01:38:19,057
We've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1506
01:38:19,145 --> 01:38:21,613
Wanting people to listen,

1507
01:38:21,705 --> 01:38:25,857
you can't just tap them
on the shoulder any more.

1508
01:38:25,945 --> 01:38:28,459
You have to hit them
with a sledgehammer.

1509
01:38:28,545 --> 01:38:31,343
Then you'll notice you've got
their strict attention.

1510
01:38:31,425 --> 01:38:34,223
But the question is,
what makes you so special

1511
01:38:34,305 --> 01:38:35,977
that people should listen?

1512
01:38:36,065 --> 01:38:37,657
I'm not special.

1513
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:41,181
I've never been
exceptional.

1514
01:38:41,265 --> 01:38:43,460
This is, though...
what I'm doing.

1515
01:38:43,545 --> 01:38:44,944
The work.

1516
01:38:45,025 --> 01:38:46,583
The work, John?

1517
01:38:46,665 --> 01:38:47,780
Yes.

1518
01:38:47,865 --> 01:38:51,175
See, I don't see anything
special about it, John.

1519
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:53,620
That's not true.

1520
01:38:53,705 --> 01:38:56,378
It is true,
and the funny thing is,

1521
01:38:56,465 --> 01:38:59,184
all this work,
two months from now,

1522
01:38:59,265 --> 01:39:02,018
no one's going to give
a shit or remember.

1523
01:39:02,105 --> 01:39:05,734
You can't see
the whole complete act yet,

1524
01:39:05,825 --> 01:39:07,781
but when this is done,

1525
01:39:07,865 --> 01:39:10,333
when it's finished,

1526
01:39:10,425 --> 01:39:13,497
it's going to be...

1527
01:39:16,025 --> 01:39:18,858
People will barely
be able to comprehend,

1528
01:39:18,945 --> 01:39:21,698
but they won't be able
to deny.

1529
01:39:21,785 --> 01:39:24,663
Could the freak
be any more vague?

1530
01:39:24,745 --> 01:39:27,134
As far as master plans go.

1531
01:39:27,225 --> 01:39:31,821
I can't wait for you to see.
It's going to be something.

1532
01:39:31,905 --> 01:39:34,738
I'm going to be
right next to you,

1533
01:39:34,825 --> 01:39:37,658
so when this thing
happens, let me know.

1534
01:39:37,745 --> 01:39:40,054
I wouldn't want to miss it.

1535
01:39:40,145 --> 01:39:43,376
Oh, don't worry. You won't.

1536
01:39:45,225 --> 01:39:47,420
You won't miss a thing.

1537
01:39:53,145 --> 01:39:55,705
Going south.
Keep two miles separation.

1538
01:39:55,785 --> 01:39:57,138
Roger.

1539
01:40:12,145 --> 01:40:14,181
What's so exciting?

1540
01:40:14,265 --> 01:40:17,063
Lt's not too far now.

1541
01:40:23,825 --> 01:40:27,534
I've been trying to figure
something in my head.

1542
01:40:27,625 --> 01:40:30,139
Maybe you can help me out.

1543
01:40:30,225 --> 01:40:33,456
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are,

1544
01:40:33,545 --> 01:40:35,900
do you know that you're insane?

1545
01:40:35,985 --> 01:40:38,294
Maybe you're reading
Guns & Ammo,

1546
01:40:38,385 --> 01:40:40,376
masturbating in your own faeces,

1547
01:40:40,465 --> 01:40:42,456
do you stop and go,

1548
01:40:42,545 --> 01:40:45,981
"Wow, it is amazing
how fucking crazy I really am"?

1549
01:40:46,065 --> 01:40:48,579
Do you guys do that?

1550
01:40:48,665 --> 01:40:49,939
Lt's more comfortable for you

1551
01:40:50,025 --> 01:40:51,902
to label me insane.

1552
01:40:51,985 --> 01:40:53,304
It's very comfortable.

1553
01:40:53,385 --> 01:40:54,613
It's not something

1554
01:40:54,705 --> 01:40:56,980
I would expect you to accept,

1555
01:40:57,065 --> 01:40:58,817
but I did not choose.

1556
01:40:58,905 --> 01:41:00,179
I was chosen.

1557
01:41:00,265 --> 01:41:01,493
Whatever.

1558
01:41:01,585 --> 01:41:04,383
I don't doubt that
you believe that, John,

1559
01:41:04,465 --> 01:41:06,342
but seems to me

1560
01:41:06,425 --> 01:41:08,336
you're overlooking
a glaring contradiction.

1561
01:41:08,425 --> 01:41:09,938
Meaning what?

1562
01:41:10,025 --> 01:41:12,744
Glad you asked.

1563
01:41:14,065 --> 01:41:16,420
If you were chosen...

1564
01:41:16,505 --> 01:41:19,497
that is, by a higher power...

1565
01:41:19,585 --> 01:41:22,145
and if your hand was forced,

1566
01:41:22,225 --> 01:41:23,738
seems strange to me

1567
01:41:23,825 --> 01:41:26,658
you would get such
enjoyment out of it.

1568
01:41:26,745 --> 01:41:28,542
You enjoyed torturing
those people.

1569
01:41:28,625 --> 01:41:30,422
Just doesn't seem

1570
01:41:30,505 --> 01:41:33,224
in keeping with
martyrdom, does it?

1571
01:41:33,305 --> 01:41:35,216
John?

1572
01:41:38,585 --> 01:41:40,974
I doubt I enjoyed it any more

1573
01:41:41,065 --> 01:41:44,341
than Detective Mills
would enjoy time alone with me

1574
01:41:44,425 --> 01:41:46,859
in a room without windows.

1575
01:41:46,945 --> 01:41:51,541
How happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity?

1576
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:52,944
That hurts my feelings.

1577
01:41:53,025 --> 01:41:54,902
I would never...

1578
01:41:54,985 --> 01:41:57,704
You wouldn't only because
there's consequences.

1579
01:41:57,785 --> 01:42:01,573
It's in those eyes
of yours, though.

1580
01:42:01,665 --> 01:42:04,304
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1581
01:42:04,385 --> 01:42:07,502
I won't deny
my own personal desire

1582
01:42:07,585 --> 01:42:10,861
to turn each sin
against the sinner.

1583
01:42:10,945 --> 01:42:13,857
Wait a minute.
I thought all you did

1584
01:42:13,945 --> 01:42:15,503
was kill innocent people.

1585
01:42:15,585 --> 01:42:18,224
Innocent? Ls that
supposed to be funny?

1586
01:42:18,305 --> 01:42:20,535
An obese man, a disgusting man

1587
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:22,422
who could barely stand up,

1588
01:42:22,505 --> 01:42:24,621
who you'd point out to friends

1589
01:42:24,705 --> 01:42:27,014
so they could join you
in mocking him?

1590
01:42:27,105 --> 01:42:29,414
Lf you saw him
while you were eating,

1591
01:42:29,505 --> 01:42:32,178
you wouldn't be able
to finish your meal.

1592
01:42:32,265 --> 01:42:34,381
After him, I picked the lawyer,

1593
01:42:34,465 --> 01:42:37,855
and you both must have
secretly been thanking me.

1594
01:42:37,945 --> 01:42:43,019
This man dedicated his life
to making money by lying

1595
01:42:43,105 --> 01:42:46,700
to keeping murderers
and rapists on the streets!

1596
01:42:46,785 --> 01:42:48,264
Murderers.

1597
01:42:48,345 --> 01:42:49,175
Murderers, John, like yourself.

1598
01:42:49,265 --> 01:42:51,096
A woman so ugly inside

1599
01:42:51,185 --> 01:42:52,982
that she couldn't bear living

1600
01:42:53,065 --> 01:42:55,898
if she couldn't be beautiful
on the outside.

1601
01:42:55,985 --> 01:42:57,213
A drug dealer -

1602
01:42:57,305 --> 01:42:59,182
a drug-dealing pederast,
actually.

1603
01:42:59,265 --> 01:43:02,655
And let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.

1604
01:43:04,865 --> 01:43:07,060
Only in a world this shitty

1605
01:43:07,145 --> 01:43:10,820
could you even try to say
these were innocent people

1606
01:43:10,905 --> 01:43:13,260
and keep a straight face.

1607
01:43:13,345 --> 01:43:15,905
But that's the point.

1608
01:43:15,985 --> 01:43:19,341
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner,

1609
01:43:19,425 --> 01:43:20,858
in every home,

1610
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:22,742
and we tolerate it.

1611
01:43:22,825 --> 01:43:25,055
We tolerate it
because it's common,

1612
01:43:25,145 --> 01:43:26,942
it's... it's trivial.

1613
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:30,097
We tolerate it
morning, noon, and night.

1614
01:43:33,345 --> 01:43:35,415
Well, not any more.

1615
01:43:37,145 --> 01:43:39,978
I'm setting the example,

1616
01:43:40,065 --> 01:43:44,183
and what I've done
is going to be puzzled over

1617
01:43:44,265 --> 01:43:46,096
and studied

1618
01:43:46,185 --> 01:43:49,222
and followed

1619
01:43:49,305 --> 01:43:51,182
forever.

1620
01:43:51,265 --> 01:43:53,096
Yeah.

1621
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:55,460
Delusions of grandeur.

1622
01:43:57,265 --> 01:43:59,256
You should be thanking me.

1623
01:43:59,345 --> 01:44:00,937
Why is that, John?

1624
01:44:01,025 --> 01:44:05,257
Because you're going to be
remembered after this.

1625
01:44:05,345 --> 01:44:07,905
The only reason
that I'm here right now

1626
01:44:07,985 --> 01:44:10,135
is that I wanted to be.

1627
01:44:10,225 --> 01:44:12,614
No. We would have
got you eventually.

1628
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:15,742
Oh, really?
So, what were you doing?

1629
01:44:15,825 --> 01:44:18,259
Biding your time,
toying with me?

1630
01:44:18,345 --> 01:44:20,620
Allowing five
innocent people to die

1631
01:44:20,705 --> 01:44:24,015
until you felt like
springing your trap?

1632
01:44:24,105 --> 01:44:26,016
What was
the indisputable evidence

1633
01:44:26,105 --> 01:44:28,938
you were going to use on me

1634
01:44:29,025 --> 01:44:32,540
before I walked up to you
and put my hands in the air?

1635
01:44:32,625 --> 01:44:33,978
John, calm down.

1636
01:44:34,065 --> 01:44:35,737
I seem to remember us

1637
01:44:35,825 --> 01:44:37,304
knocking on your door.

1638
01:44:37,385 --> 01:44:39,182
Oh, that's right.

1639
01:44:39,265 --> 01:44:42,621
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1640
01:44:46,585 --> 01:44:49,383
You're only alive
because I didn't kill you.

1641
01:44:49,465 --> 01:44:51,057
OK. Sit back.

1642
01:44:51,145 --> 01:44:52,783
I spared you.

1643
01:44:52,865 --> 01:44:55,504
Remember that every time
you look in the mirror

1644
01:44:55,585 --> 01:44:57,655
for the rest of your life,

1645
01:44:57,745 --> 01:45:02,455
or for the rest of what life
I've allowed you to have.

1646
01:45:02,545 --> 01:45:04,422
Sit back, you fucking freak!

1647
01:45:04,505 --> 01:45:06,063
Shut your fucking mouth!

1648
01:45:06,145 --> 01:45:07,578
You're no messiah.

1649
01:45:07,665 --> 01:45:09,974
You're a movie of the week.

1650
01:45:10,065 --> 01:45:11,817
You're a fucking t-shirt,

1651
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:13,782
at best.

1652
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:27,936
Don't ask me
to pity those people.

1653
01:45:28,025 --> 01:45:29,697
I don't mourn them any more

1654
01:45:29,785 --> 01:45:32,697
than the thousands that died
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1655
01:45:32,785 --> 01:45:35,458
Is that to say
what you were doing

1656
01:45:35,545 --> 01:45:37,342
was God's good work?

1657
01:45:40,105 --> 01:45:43,541
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

1658
01:45:44,625 --> 01:45:47,458
Do you see
those high-tension towers?

1659
01:45:47,545 --> 01:45:48,773
That's where we're headed.

1660
01:45:48,865 --> 01:45:50,696
I see where
he's talking about.

1661
01:45:50,785 --> 01:45:52,298
Follow the access road.

1662
01:45:57,705 --> 01:46:00,663
Your signal's breaking up.

1663
01:46:00,745 --> 01:46:02,622
Un-fucking-avoidable, sir.

1664
01:46:02,705 --> 01:46:04,696
We're in powerline city.

1665
01:46:04,785 --> 01:46:07,936
There sure as shit
is no ambush out here.

1666
01:46:08,025 --> 01:46:10,664
Can't land anywhere
near those wires.

1667
01:46:10,745 --> 01:46:14,101
They're coming up behind us
in about two minutes.

1668
01:46:14,185 --> 01:46:15,743
Go up, way up.

1669
01:46:15,825 --> 01:46:19,500
30 seconds, back east.
On my mark. 30 seconds.

1670
01:47:17,905 --> 01:47:19,816
I'm getting him out.

1671
01:47:24,225 --> 01:47:26,056
We've got you in sight.

1672
01:47:26,145 --> 01:47:28,022
Get out...

1673
01:47:28,105 --> 01:47:30,335
Slowly.

1674
01:47:30,425 --> 01:47:32,416
Stop.

1675
01:47:32,505 --> 01:47:34,302
Stay.

1676
01:47:36,585 --> 01:47:37,779
What do you got?

1677
01:47:37,865 --> 01:47:40,982
Dead dog.

1678
01:47:42,105 --> 01:47:43,697
I didn't do that.

1679
01:47:47,225 --> 01:47:49,375
We're holding on stand-by. Copy.

1680
01:47:49,465 --> 01:47:51,421
What time is it?

1681
01:47:51,505 --> 01:47:53,063
Why?

1682
01:47:53,145 --> 01:47:54,703
I'd like to know.

1683
01:47:57,465 --> 01:47:58,944
7:01.

1684
01:48:01,265 --> 01:48:03,221
It's close.

1685
01:48:03,305 --> 01:48:05,296
Well, let's go take a look.

1686
01:48:08,105 --> 01:48:09,902
It's this way.

1687
01:48:12,385 --> 01:48:14,501
Bird Two, close your distance.

1688
01:48:14,585 --> 01:48:17,782
They're moving
away from the car.

1689
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:22,456
We got them, we got them.

1690
01:48:22,545 --> 01:48:23,819
Closing in.

1691
01:48:23,905 --> 01:48:25,896
Negative, negative.

1692
01:48:50,625 --> 01:48:52,422
Mills.

1693
01:48:56,225 --> 01:48:59,820
Down. Down, down.

1694
01:48:59,905 --> 01:49:01,816
Watch him.

1695
01:49:01,905 --> 01:49:04,419
There he goes.

1696
01:49:04,505 --> 01:49:06,973
It's good we have
time to talk.

1697
01:49:12,465 --> 01:49:15,696
Stay on the guy in red!

1698
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:26,943
There's a van
coming down the road

1699
01:49:27,025 --> 01:49:28,777
from the north.

1700
01:49:37,305 --> 01:49:39,136
Be ready for anything now.

1701
01:49:39,225 --> 01:49:41,614
Wait for my signal. Wait for me.

1702
01:49:46,745 --> 01:49:48,701
Get out of the van!

1703
01:49:49,945 --> 01:49:51,094
Out!

1704
01:49:51,185 --> 01:49:53,141
Jesus Christ, man.
Don't shoot me!

1705
01:49:53,225 --> 01:49:54,817
Step away!

1706
01:49:54,905 --> 01:49:57,180
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head!

1707
01:49:57,265 --> 01:49:58,937
What the hell is going on?

1708
01:49:59,025 --> 01:50:00,981
What are you doing here?

1709
01:50:01,065 --> 01:50:03,295
I'm just delivering
a package, man.

1710
01:50:03,385 --> 01:50:06,138
I got this package
for this guy David,

1711
01:50:06,225 --> 01:50:08,136
Detective David Mills.

1712
01:50:13,905 --> 01:50:15,179
Get it...

1713
01:50:15,265 --> 01:50:17,176
Slowly.

1714
01:50:17,265 --> 01:50:19,574
He's opening
the back of the van.

1715
01:50:19,665 --> 01:50:21,735
We've got him in sight.

1716
01:50:27,345 --> 01:50:29,336
This guy paid me 500 bucks

1717
01:50:29,425 --> 01:50:30,904
to bring it out here, man.

1718
01:50:30,985 --> 01:50:33,180
He said he wanted it here
at exactly 7:00.

1719
01:50:33,265 --> 01:50:34,220
Put it down.

1720
01:50:35,425 --> 01:50:37,177
We got a box.

1721
01:50:37,265 --> 01:50:38,744
We got a box!

1722
01:50:38,825 --> 01:50:41,339
Call the bomb squad.
We got a box.

1723
01:50:41,425 --> 01:50:42,983
Face the van.

1724
01:50:43,065 --> 01:50:45,135
Hands up.

1725
01:50:51,825 --> 01:50:53,053
Turn around.

1726
01:50:54,625 --> 01:50:55,774
OK. Go.

1727
01:50:55,865 --> 01:50:58,743
Off you go. Go!

1728
01:50:58,825 --> 01:51:01,544
I'm sending the driver
round on foot.

1729
01:51:04,145 --> 01:51:06,454
He's headed north
along the road.

1730
01:51:06,545 --> 01:51:08,137
Have him picked up.

1731
01:51:16,225 --> 01:51:18,500
I don't know. I don't know.

1732
01:51:24,305 --> 01:51:26,341
I'm going to open it.

1733
01:51:26,425 --> 01:51:28,416
When I said I admired you,

1734
01:51:28,505 --> 01:51:30,302
I meant what I said.

1735
01:51:47,305 --> 01:51:49,136
There's blood.

1736
01:51:49,225 --> 01:51:52,979
You've made quite a life
for yourself, Detective.

1737
01:51:53,065 --> 01:51:55,056
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

1738
01:52:21,025 --> 01:52:22,856
California, stay away from here.

1739
01:52:22,945 --> 01:52:25,618
Stay away from here.
Don't come in here.

1740
01:52:25,705 --> 01:52:27,821
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1741
01:52:27,905 --> 01:52:30,339
John Doe has the upper hand.

1742
01:52:30,425 --> 01:52:31,938
Mills!

1743
01:52:32,025 --> 01:52:33,458
Here he comes.

1744
01:52:33,545 --> 01:52:35,422
Throw your gun down!

1745
01:52:35,505 --> 01:52:37,655
I wish I could have
lived like you did.

1746
01:52:37,745 --> 01:52:38,894
What the fuck you talking about?

1747
01:52:38,985 --> 01:52:42,022
Do you hear me, Detective?

1748
01:52:42,105 --> 01:52:44,744
I'm trying to tell you
how much I admire you

1749
01:52:44,825 --> 01:52:46,258
and your pretty wife.

1750
01:52:46,345 --> 01:52:48,176
What?

1751
01:52:48,265 --> 01:52:49,493
Tracy.

1752
01:52:49,585 --> 01:52:51,064
What'd you fuckin' say?

1753
01:52:51,145 --> 01:52:54,296
Lt's disturbing how easily
a member of the press

1754
01:52:54,385 --> 01:52:57,502
can purchase information
from the men in your precinct.

1755
01:52:57,585 --> 01:52:59,382
What the fuck?

1756
01:52:59,465 --> 01:53:01,581
Throw your gun down!

1757
01:53:01,665 --> 01:53:03,701
I visited your home this morning

1758
01:53:03,785 --> 01:53:05,457
after you'd left.

1759
01:53:05,545 --> 01:53:08,582
I tried to play husband.

1760
01:53:08,665 --> 01:53:12,374
I tried to taste
the life of a simple man.

1761
01:53:12,465 --> 01:53:13,739
Throw it away!

1762
01:53:13,825 --> 01:53:15,975
Lt didn't work out...

1763
01:53:16,065 --> 01:53:19,535
So I took a souvenir -

1764
01:53:20,985 --> 01:53:23,021
her pretty head.

1765
01:53:23,105 --> 01:53:24,584
Mills!

1766
01:53:27,465 --> 01:53:29,103
What's he talking about?

1767
01:53:29,185 --> 01:53:30,061
Give me your gun.

1768
01:53:30,145 --> 01:53:31,339
What's going on there?

1769
01:53:31,425 --> 01:53:33,302
Put the gun... put the gun down.

1770
01:53:33,385 --> 01:53:34,784
What was in the box?

1771
01:53:34,865 --> 01:53:36,617
Because I envy
your normal life.

1772
01:53:36,705 --> 01:53:37,774
Put the gun down.

1773
01:53:37,865 --> 01:53:39,617
It seems that envy is my sin.

1774
01:53:39,705 --> 01:53:41,536
What's in the box?

1775
01:53:41,625 --> 01:53:43,183
What's in the fucking box?

1776
01:53:43,265 --> 01:53:44,903
I just told you.

1777
01:53:44,985 --> 01:53:46,054
You lie!

1778
01:53:46,145 --> 01:53:48,181
You're a fucking liar!

1779
01:53:48,265 --> 01:53:49,539
That's what he wants.

1780
01:53:49,625 --> 01:53:51,456
He wants you to shoot him.

1781
01:53:51,545 --> 01:53:53,979
No! No!

1782
01:53:54,065 --> 01:53:56,704
You tell me that it's not true.

1783
01:53:56,785 --> 01:53:58,696
Become vengeance, David.

1784
01:53:58,785 --> 01:54:00,218
She's all right.

1785
01:54:00,305 --> 01:54:02,455
Become... wrath.

1786
01:54:02,545 --> 01:54:03,819
Tell me!

1787
01:54:03,905 --> 01:54:05,861
Lf you murder a suspect,
David...

1788
01:54:05,945 --> 01:54:07,458
No!

1789
01:54:07,545 --> 01:54:09,536
No!

1790
01:54:09,625 --> 01:54:11,581
She begged for her life,
Detective.

1791
01:54:11,665 --> 01:54:13,860
She begged for her life

1792
01:54:13,945 --> 01:54:15,219
and for her baby's life.

1793
01:54:15,305 --> 01:54:16,340
Shut up!

1794
01:54:33,145 --> 01:54:34,897
He didn't know.

1795
01:54:47,745 --> 01:54:49,815
Give me the gun, David.

1796
01:54:54,825 --> 01:54:56,497
David...

1797
01:54:56,585 --> 01:54:59,145
If you kill him...

1798
01:54:59,225 --> 01:55:02,297
he will win.

1799
01:55:05,785 --> 01:55:07,218
Oh, God!

1800
01:55:07,305 --> 01:55:09,136
Oh, God!

1801
01:55:24,265 --> 01:55:25,937
Oh, fuck. He shot him!

1802
01:55:46,945 --> 01:55:48,856
Set it down somewhere.

1803
01:55:50,825 --> 01:55:52,656
Come on. Set us down.

1804
01:55:55,185 --> 01:55:56,504
Holy Christ,

1805
01:55:56,585 --> 01:55:58,382
somebody call somebody.

1806
01:55:58,465 --> 01:56:00,899
Call somebody.

1807
01:56:14,225 --> 01:56:17,615
Well, we'll take care of him.

1808
01:56:25,545 --> 01:56:27,740
Whatever he needs.

1809
01:56:27,825 --> 01:56:30,214
Where are you going to be?

1810
01:56:32,785 --> 01:56:34,104
Around.

1811
01:56:38,385 --> 01:56:39,818
I'll be around.

1812
01:56:43,505 --> 01:56:45,973
Ernest Hemingway once wrote,

1813
01:56:46,065 --> 01:56:48,260
"The world is a fine place

1814
01:56:48,345 --> 01:56:51,143
"and worth fighting for."

1815
01:56:51,225 --> 01:56:53,785
I agree with the second part.
