1
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:21,789
<i>My name is Max.</i>

2
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,225
<i>My world is fire and blood.</i>

3
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>Why are you hurting these people?</i>

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,329
- <i>It's the oil, stupid.</i>
- <i>Oil wars.</i>

5
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,365
- <i>We are killing for guzzoline.</i>
- <i>Guzzoline.</i>

6
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,267
<i>The world is actually
running out of water.</i>

7
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,603
<i>Now there's the water wars.</i>

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,239
<i>Once, I was a cop,</i>

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,175
<i>a road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.</i>

10
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,911
<i>...to the terminal freak-out point.</i>

11
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:47,114
<i>Mankind has gone rogue,
terrorizing itself.</i>

12
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,749
<i>Thermonuclear skirmish.</i>

13
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,585
- <i>The earth is sour.</i>
- <i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

14
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,755
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

15
00:00:54,855 --> 00:01:00,260
<i>As the world fell, each of us,
in our own way, was broken.</i>

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,355
<i>It was hard to know
who was more crazy...</i>

17
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:09,293
<i>me or everyone else.</i>

18
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,998
<i>Hello?</i>

19
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,268
<i>Where are you?</i>

20
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,218
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

21
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,588
- <i>Here they come again.</i>
- <i>Max Rockatansky.</i>

22
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,058
<i>Worming their way
into the black matter of my brain.</i>

23
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,985
- <i>Help us, Max.</i>
- <i>You promised to help us.</i>

24
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:41,700
<i>I tell myself... they cannot touch me.</i>

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,870
<i>They are long dead.</i>

26
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,330
After him!

27
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:23,134
After him!

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,140
Now!

29
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:48,535
<i>I am the one who runs
from both the living and the dead,</i>

30
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,704
<i>hunted by scavengers,</i>

31
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,599
<i>haunted by those I could not protect.</i>

32
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,513
<i>So I exist in this wasteland.</i>

33
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:16,196
<i>A man reduced to a single instinct...</i>

34
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,489
<i>survive.</i>

35
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,973
Max? Is that you? Where were you?

36
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,754
Help us. Where were you?
Help us, Max. Where were you, Max?

37
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,850
Stop running, Max. Stop running.

38
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,933
You let us die.

39
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,378
You let us die!

40
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,180
You let us die!

41
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,081
You promised to help us.

42
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,292
Witness!

43
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,059
- We are War Boys!
- War Boys!

44
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,329
- Kamakrazee War Boys!
- War Boys!

45
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:39,132
Fucacima Kamakrazee War Boys!

46
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,234
Hooked on!

47
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:46,039
- Today we're headin' to Gas Town!
- Gas Town!

48
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,402
- Today we're haulin' Aqua Cola.
- Aqua cola!

49
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,947
- Today we're haulin' produce!
- Produce!

50
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,617
And today we're haulin' mother's milk!

51
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,186
Mother's milk!

52
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,371
Rev it up for the Immortan Joe!

53
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,915
Once again, we send off my war rig

54
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,318
to bring back guzzoline from Gas Town

55
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,355
and bullets from The Bullet Farm.

56
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:14,427
Once again,
I salute my imperator, Furiosa!

57
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,598
And I salute my half-life War Boys

58
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,234
who will ride with me eternal

59
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,255
on the highways of Valhalla.

60
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,109
I am your redeemer!

61
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,878
It is by my hand

62
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:37,150
you will rise from the ashes
of this world!

63
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,993
It's comin'. Get ready.

64
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,531
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's comin'.

65
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:52,258
Do not, my friends,
become addicted to water.

66
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:58,130
It will take hold of you.
And you will resent its absence.

67
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,491
Get 'em all off!

68
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,060
Get 'em all off!

69
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,820
Clear off!

70
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,332
Signal Gas Town. Convoy's on its way.

71
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,837
I got a War Boy runnin' on empty.

72
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,497
Hook up that full-life.

73
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,579
Careful. That's a universal donor.

74
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:19,129
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

75
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,350
Bullet Farm?

76
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,248
We're heading east.

77
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,717
I'll pass it down the line.

78
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,287
New orders! Thunder up! Thunder up!

79
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,589
This is not a supply run!

80
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,678
- Go. Go. Go.
- Ace, what's going on?

81
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:41,127
- We're heading east.
- Why?

82
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,788
I don't know. That's the order.

83
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,215
Moo.

84
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,809
Hey, pa. You know about this?

85
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:09,113
Your produce ain't going to Gas Town.

86
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,669
She's gone off-road...
into hostile territory.

87
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,950
Why would she do that, Dad?

88
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,376
- Let me see. Let me see. I wanna see!
- Rictus.

89
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,572
Rictus, go see what's agitating Dad!

90
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,310
Splendid!

91
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,137
Angharad!

92
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,856
Where are they?

93
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,925
They are not your property.

94
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,661
- Miss Giddy?
- You cannot own a human being.

95
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,131
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

96
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,604
Where is she taking them?!

97
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:30,495
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go.

98
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,608
- Where is she taking them?
- A long way from you.

99
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,894
Hey, what's happening?

100
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:08,675
Slit. What's going on? Slit!

101
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,644
Treason, betrayal,
an imperator gone rogue.

102
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,246
An imperator. Who?

103
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,449
Furiosa. She took a lot of stuff
from Immortan Joe.

104
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,786
- What stuff?
- Breeders. His prize breeders.

105
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,513
He wants them back.
Not a hand laid on 'em.

106
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,690
By my deeds, I honor him. V-8.

107
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,746
- That's my wheel.
- I'm driving.

108
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,549
- You're my lancer.
- I just promoted myself.

109
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,285
- Not today. Today is my day.
- Look at you!

110
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,354
If you can't stand up, you can't do war!

111
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,023
- He's right, son.
- I'm not staying here dying soft.

112
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,301
You're already a corpse.

113
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:03,062
- I just need a top-up, some more juice.
- There's no time!

114
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,666
We take my blood bag. We take my blood bag
and strap him to the lancer's perch.

115
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,841
It's got a muzzle on it.
It's a raging feral.

116
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:11,696
That's right. High-octane
crazy blood fillin' me up.

117
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:18,912
If I'm gonna die...

118
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,147
I'm gonna die historic on the fury road.

119
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,824
- Yeah. Yeah. Organic.
- Yeah?

120
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,442
- Hitch up his blood bag.
- Right-o.

121
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,269
Yeah!

122
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:49,100
How much more can they take from me?
They've got my blood. Now it's my car!

123
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,685
Immortan!

124
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,580
Immortan Joe!

125
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,921
He looked at me!

126
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:38,491
- He looked right at me!
- He looked at your blood bag!

127
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,994
He turned his head.
He looked me straight in the eye.

128
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,396
He was scanning the horizon.

129
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:46,799
No. I am awaited.

130
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,993
I am awaited in Valhalla!

131
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,497
<i>Confucamus!</i>

132
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,411
Immortan!

133
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,504
Yeah!

134
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,193
- Hey! Heads up!
- Heads up!

135
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,160
Boss!

136
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,111
We got vehicles from The Citadel.
They're firing flares.

137
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,414
They want reinforcements
from Gas Town and The Bullet Farm.

138
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,784
What is this? Backup? Decoy?

139
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:40,711
It's a detour.

140
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,160
Eyes right.

141
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:20,726
Buzzards! Buzzards right!
Eyes on! Eyes on!

142
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,762
Buzzards right! Eyes on!

143
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,263
Yeah!

144
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:29,268
Should we turn it 'round
and run 'em into our backup?

145
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,767
No. We're good.

146
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,786
We fang it!

147
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,395
Thunder up! Here we go!

148
00:19:42,675 --> 00:19:44,408
Prepare the gunners!

149
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,787
Morsov!

150
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:20,444
Come on, attack!

151
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,084
War!

152
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,800
Ready!

153
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,422
She's ours, Slit! She's ours.

154
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,324
First, we get the buzzards off her back!

155
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,261
Form up!

156
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:45,407
That's my head!

157
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,899
Get up! You can do it!

158
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:27,780
Morsov!

159
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:31,620
- Morsov!
- No!

160
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,755
- Witness me!
- Witness!

161
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,446
Witness!

162
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:53,424
Mediocre, Morsov! Mediocre!

163
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,118
Ready!

164
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,995
Get ready!

165
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,886
Back me in!

166
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,203
They're coming!

167
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:54,158
- We can't breathe down there!
- Stay out of sight!

168
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,393
Now!

169
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:09,682
Go back!

170
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,995
Hydraulics! Hydraulics!

171
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,843
Yeah.

172
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,916
Now we bring home the Booty.

173
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,678
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

174
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:17,541
She thinks we're stupid.
She thinks she can lose us in there!

175
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,038
Fang it! Fang it!

176
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:47,165
Why can't you stop?

177
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:50,116
Crew! Outta the way! Out of the way!

178
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,910
What have you done? What have you done?!

179
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,200
We need counterweight.
Get the blood bag down the back.

180
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,514
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

181
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,818
Hey, head... say bye-bye to the neck!

182
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,478
- <i>Decapito!</i>
- We're goin' in, Slit!

183
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:06,310
Come on! We've almost got her!

184
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,486
Come on! Hold it steady!

185
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:47,284
Oh, what a day! What a lovely day!

186
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,107
I am the man... who grabs the sun...

187
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,267
riding to Valhalla!

188
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,916
Witness me, blood bag!

189
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,689
Witness!

190
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,981
I live, I die, I live again!

191
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,556
We're not going back.

192
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,544
Water.

193
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:03,417
You.

194
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:22,445
Angharad, is that just the wind,
or is it a furious vexation?

195
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,269
I got it!

196
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,489
Glory me, blood bag!
We snagged her alive.

197
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,258
He's gonna shred her. Shred her!

198
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,127
Bolt cutters.

199
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,087
Chain.

200
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,155
Hey, hey!

201
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,369
Oh, look at them.

202
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:55,941
So shiny, so chrome.
He's gonna be so grateful.

203
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,411
We could ask for anything.

204
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,213
I wanna drive the war rig.

205
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,516
- What are you gonna ask for?
- That's my jacket.

206
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,317
Sure.

207
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:08,920
I mean, you can ask
for more than a jacket.

208
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,355
We're going to the Green Place.

209
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,215
Wait, it's you and me.

210
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,906
We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.

211
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,759
How does it feel?

212
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,730
- It hurts.
- Out here, everything hurts.

213
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,458
You wanna get through this?

214
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:01,556
Do as I say.

215
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,037
Now pick up what you can and run.

216
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,481
Kill switches.

217
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,786
I set the sequence myself.
This rig goes nowhere without me.

218
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,434
You can get in.

219
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:04,694
Not without them.

220
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,680
So we wait.

221
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:25,690
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

222
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,851
You've already damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

223
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,170
You're sitting on 2,000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.

224
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,333
I'd say you've got
about a five-minute head start.

225
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:53,776
You want that thing off your face?

226
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,189
Let's go.

227
00:41:50,701 --> 00:41:54,337
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.

228
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:15,925
Smeg!

229
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,089
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

230
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,858
- What choice does she have?
- He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

231
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,026
- Why?
- To bargain.

232
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,328
Oh, he'll hurt us, all right.

233
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,017
Do you think he's coming
to the Green Place?

234
00:42:45,117 --> 00:42:48,091
Never! He's a crazy smeg
who eats <i>schlanger!</i>

235
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,262
- Stay out of there.
- Behind you.

236
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:23,535
The Gas Town boys.

237
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,497
Don't damage the goods.

238
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:35,138
What do you see?

239
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:39,484
Big Rigs.

240
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,653
Polecats.

241
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,789
Flamers.

242
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,159
And there's the People Eater himself.

243
00:43:49,428 --> 00:43:51,362
Coming to count the cost.

244
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:11,149
We're dragging something out back.
I think it's the fuel pod.

245
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:14,265
No, no.

246
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:16,562
I'll go.

247
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:42,097
Filth! You traited him!

248
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:46,880
No unnecessary killing!

249
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,692
- This War Boy wants me dead!
- We agreed!

250
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:51,482
He's Kamakrazee!

251
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,985
He's just a kid at the end
of his half-life.

252
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,854
No! I live, I die, I live again!

253
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,662
- Hold him!
- Tie him up!

254
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:00,273
Throw him out!

255
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:02,242
Chuck him out.

256
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,128
You got more friends.

257
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,710
Bullet Farmer.
They're coming from The Bullet Farm.

258
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:11,297
Yeah?

259
00:46:11,397 --> 00:46:13,772
It's over. You can't defy him.

260
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,940
- Watch us, mate.
- He is the one who grabbed the sun.

261
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,875
Look at how slick
he's fooled you, War Boy!

262
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,945
- He's a lying old man.
- By his hand, we'll be lifted up!

263
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:23,548
That's why we have his logo
seared on our backs!

264
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:25,350
"Breeding stock!" "Battle fodder!"

265
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,553
- No, I am awaited!
- You're an old man's battle fodder!

266
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:31,222
- Killing everyone and everything!
- We're not to blame!

267
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:33,391
Then who killed the world?

268
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,726
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

269
00:47:03,826 --> 00:47:06,057
I don't know if it's still any good.

270
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:10,086
Get back in the hold!
Keep the hatch open.

271
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,640
I need you here.

272
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,172
You may have to drive the rig.

273
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:28,751
You.

274
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,761
You stay.

275
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:33,042
You stay there.

276
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,222
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

277
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,084
I'm supposed to be alone.
That was the deal.

278
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,625
Down here.

279
00:48:10,723 --> 00:48:12,688
Hey.

280
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:14,933
What's your name?

281
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:18,197
What do I call you?

282
00:48:18,297 --> 00:48:20,630
Does it matter?

283
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:23,353
Fine.

284
00:48:23,453 --> 00:48:26,862
When I yell "fool," you drive
out of here as fast as you can.

285
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:31,698
This is the sequence... one.

286
00:48:31,798 --> 00:48:34,312
One, two. One.

287
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,848
Red, black, go.

288
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,786
You have it?

289
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,070
It's all here!

290
00:50:07,064 --> 00:50:10,065
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!

291
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,746
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

292
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,532
You drop the rocks.

293
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:32,763
You said, "a few vehicles
in pursuit. Maybe."

294
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,633
We count three war parties!

295
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:39,728
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.
Let's do this!

296
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:07,465
Fool!

297
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,974
That's our fuel!

298
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:07,258
Make way for the ripsaw!

299
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:25,577
Once I'm over, clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.

300
00:52:25,677 --> 00:52:28,913
Immortan! Immortan Joe!

301
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:32,707
I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the war rig!

302
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:37,708
You! Climb aboard!

303
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:40,057
Hey! Hey!

304
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:45,063
I got his boot!
I got the blood bag's boot!

305
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:48,933
Take me! I got his boot!

306
00:52:50,506 --> 00:52:52,903
All this for a family squabble.

307
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:56,006
Healthy babies.

308
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,344
Reload the clip.

309
00:55:05,444 --> 00:55:07,872
I can't.

310
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,013
Gun!

311
00:55:15,863 --> 00:55:17,481
- Give the gun!
- It's not loaded yet!

312
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,075
- You! We had a deal!
- Now!

313
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:09,800
Rictus!

314
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,761
The wives! No more flames.

315
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,744
Splendid!

316
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:26,074
Splendid! That's my child! My property!

317
00:56:28,169 --> 00:56:30,342
Immorta...

318
00:56:38,835 --> 00:56:42,666
Immortan, if I get on the rig,
there's a way inside.

319
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,268
- What is your name?
- It's Nux.

320
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:47,504
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing for ya.

321
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:48,806
No.

322
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:53,577
Put a bullet in her skull, stop the rig,
return my treasures to me,

323
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:59,683
and I myself will carry you
to the gates of Valhalla.

324
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,019
Am I awaited?

325
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:06,757
You will ride eternal...
shiny and chrome.

326
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,426
Rictus!

327
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,495
Help him aboard!

328
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,452
Ready?

329
00:57:14,552 --> 00:57:16,729
Here we go!

330
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:29,805
Mediocre!

331
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:01,068
<i>Schlanger!</i>

332
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:21,890
Look out!

333
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:28,430
Angharad! Get out!

334
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,086
- No!
- Angharad!

335
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,203
Stop! Turn the rig around!

336
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,203
Go back for her!

337
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:14,784
- No.
- Tell him to turn the rig around!

338
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,455
- Did you see it?
- She went under the wheels.

339
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,891
Did you see it?

340
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,293
She went under the wheels.

341
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,550
- We keep moving.
- No!

342
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:30,106
- We keep moving!
- He doesn't know what he's talking about!

343
00:59:30,206 --> 00:59:32,178
Whatever happens,
we're going to the Green Place.

344
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,671
The stupid Green Place.
We don't even know where to find it.

345
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:50,521
- You all right?
- On! On!

346
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:28,959
Cheedo!

347
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:30,994
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

348
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:33,830
- Stop!
- He'll forgive us. I know he will.

349
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,867
- There is no going back!
- We were his treasures!

350
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,702
- Cheedo!
- We were protected.

351
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,004
He gave us the high life.

352
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:42,239
- What's wrong with that?
- We are not things.

353
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:45,311
No!

354
01:00:45,811 --> 01:00:48,512
- Cheedo, we are not things!
- We are not things.

355
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:51,381
- I don't want to hear that again!
- They were her words!

356
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,817
And now she's dead!

357
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:55,343
Wring your hands.

358
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,524
- You're not going back to him.
- Angharad!

359
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:03,050
Come on! Come on!

360
01:01:19,786 --> 01:01:22,013
So...

361
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,049
Where is this...

362
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:27,851
This Green Place?

363
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,454
It's a long night's run, heading east.

364
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:37,451
We need inventory. I want you
to match every gun with its bullets.

365
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:42,432
I'm gonna go down and do some repairs.

366
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,035
- We need someone down the back.
- I'll go.

367
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,572
No. I want you to stay together.

368
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:50,265
I can do it.

369
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,474
What are you doing here?

370
01:02:25,574 --> 01:02:29,812
He saw it. He saw it all.

371
01:02:30,382 --> 01:02:34,274
My own blood bag
drivin' the rig that killed her.

372
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:42,984
Stop doing that.

373
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:46,388
Stop.

374
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,376
Thr... three times
the gates were open to me.

375
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,387
What gates?

376
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:05,747
I was awaited in Valhalla.
They were calling my name.

377
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:09,511
I should be walking with the immorta,
mcfeasting with the heroes of all time.

378
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,526
I'd say it was
your manifest destiny not to.

379
01:03:17,926 --> 01:03:20,664
I thought I was being spared
for something great.

380
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:25,034
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

381
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,372
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

382
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,207
Who are Larry and Barry?

383
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:34,544
My mates. Larry and Barry.

384
01:03:36,144 --> 01:03:39,774
If they don't get me,
then the night fevers will.

385
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:08,477
Well, we've only got four for big boy here,
so he's all but useless.

386
01:04:08,577 --> 01:04:15,018
But we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.

387
01:04:16,426 --> 01:04:18,422
Angharad used to call them antiseed.

388
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:22,821
Plant one and watch something die.

389
01:05:56,944 --> 01:06:00,056
We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline,

390
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:03,993
19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes,

391
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:07,063
7 pursuit vehicles. The deficit mounts.

392
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:11,635
And now, sir, you have us
stuck in a quagmire.

393
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:13,570
Hey, Joe!

394
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:15,639
Boss!

395
01:06:17,496 --> 01:06:20,167
Your girly's breathing her last!

396
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:22,789
What about the child?

397
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,857
- Are ya comin', brother?
- Wait!

398
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:40,521
- It's gone awful quiet in there.
- Get it out. Get it out!

399
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,834
Come on!
I've been called to the torture!

400
01:06:45,858 --> 01:06:48,113
Patience!

401
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:50,907
Oh, you stay here
with your grief, Daddy.

402
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:55,969
- I'll fetch 'em for ya.
- Be careful! Protect the assets!

403
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,683
Just one angry shot...

404
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:01,655
for Furiosa.

405
01:07:01,755 --> 01:07:03,963
Hut!

406
01:07:10,256 --> 01:07:12,729
Cryin' shame.

407
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,949
Come.

408
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:16,958
Nother month...

409
01:07:17,058 --> 01:07:19,069
Could've been your viable human.

410
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:22,230
- Was it a male?
- Your a-one Alpha prime.

411
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,679
Hey, Rictus!

412
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,643
You lost a baby brother.

413
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,141
Perfect in every way.

414
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:40,957
I had a baby brother!
I had a little baby brother!

415
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:45,852
And he was perfect!
Perfect in every way!

416
01:08:15,692 --> 01:08:16,804
Come on.

417
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,381
- Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.
- Just probing.

418
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:43,186
- He wants to help!
- Who?!

419
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:46,024
- The War Boy!
- Where did he come from?!

420
01:08:46,124 --> 01:08:49,083
I thought we threw him off the rig!

421
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,731
There's high ground
just beyond that thing.

422
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:58,568
- He means the tree.
- Yeah. Tree!

423
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,871
- Leave him to me.
- Say, anyone notice that bright light?

424
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,340
Encroaching gunfire?

425
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,376
- Get out.
- I can do this. I know this machine.

426
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,150
He does. He's a revhead.

427
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:16,394
You've got two left.

428
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,249
On him.

429
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:42,069
Don't breathe.

430
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:48,918
Hey! Hey! Hey! War Boy!

431
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,721
I'm gonna use the winch
'round the tree thing!

432
01:09:52,727 --> 01:09:55,859
Take this. Let's get the engine plates.

433
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:58,027
You drive the rig!

434
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,829
- Hold up a flare.
- I am holding a flare!

435
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:04,167
- Closer.
- It's right in front of your eyes!

436
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,471
Hut! Hut!

437
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,626
Blood bag!

438
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:33,963
I am the scales of justice!

439
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:38,291
Conductor of the choir of death!

440
01:10:41,037 --> 01:10:43,847
Sing, brother koch!

441
01:10:45,595 --> 01:10:49,145
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

442
01:10:50,345 --> 01:10:52,814
Don't they know they're shooting at us?

443
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:08,625
Gun fever!

444
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,103
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.

445
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,838
How are the engines?

446
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,498
Very hot and real thirsty.

447
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:34,283
Hey. You need to take the war rig
half a click down the track.

448
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,978
What if you're not back
by the time the engines have cooled?

449
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:42,282
Well, you keep moving.

450
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,401
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

451
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,104
Retaliate first.

452
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:00,600
Let's go!

453
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,990
Are you hurt?

454
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:25,662
- You're bleeding.
- That's not his blood.

455
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,532
What is this?

456
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,375
It's mother's milk.

457
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:15,845
It's okay. Sleep.

458
01:15:17,101 --> 01:15:19,339
Get some rest.

459
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:32,219
How do you know this place even exists?

460
01:15:34,297 --> 01:15:35,756
I was born there.

461
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:39,602
So why'd you leave?

462
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,304
I didn't.

463
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,231
I was taken as a child.

464
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:47,549
Stolen.

465
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:56,826
- You done this before?
- Many times.

466
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:01,290
Now that I drive a war rig...

467
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,891
this is the best shot I'll ever have.

468
01:16:05,126 --> 01:16:06,229
And them?

469
01:16:08,135 --> 01:16:10,799
They're looking for hope.

470
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,526
What about you?

471
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:19,766
Redemption.

472
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:05,912
Hey, what's that?

473
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:20,728
I remember something like that.

474
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:34,342
Help me!

475
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:39,155
Help me!

476
01:17:41,656 --> 01:17:44,325
Help me, please!

477
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:47,374
That's bait.

478
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:48,961
Stay in the rig.

479
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:58,084
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

480
01:17:58,741 --> 01:18:01,777
I am one of the Vuvalini!

481
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,547
Of the Many Mothers!

482
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:08,951
My initiate mother was K.T. Concannon!

483
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,213
I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.

484
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:17,344
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

485
01:19:03,604 --> 01:19:04,784
It's me.

486
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:15,083
There's something in the eyes.

487
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:17,618
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

488
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:25,284
This is our Furiosa.

489
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,051
How long has it been?

490
01:19:29,896 --> 01:19:34,637
7,000 days.
Plus the ones I don't remember.

491
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:37,540
Furiosa.

492
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,836
What happened to your mother?

493
01:19:40,936 --> 01:19:42,778
She died.

494
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:45,505
On the third day.

495
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:55,657
- From where did you come?
- The west. Citadel.

496
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:58,051
Beyond the mountains.

497
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:03,732
The men... who are they?

498
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:07,794
They're reliable.
They helped us get here.

499
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:22,178
Where did you find such creatures?

500
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,788
So soft.

501
01:20:25,888 --> 01:20:28,750
This one has all her teeth.

502
01:20:36,397 --> 01:20:39,034
I can't wait for them to see it.

503
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:41,103
See?

504
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:44,931
- See what?
- Home.

505
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,879
The Green Place.

506
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:55,531
But if you came from the west,
you passed it.

507
01:20:55,931 --> 01:21:00,753
The crows. The creepy place
with all the crows.

508
01:21:01,353 --> 01:21:02,825
- The soil.
- We had to get out.

509
01:21:02,925 --> 01:21:04,694
- We had no water and...
- The water was filth.

510
01:21:04,794 --> 01:21:08,330
- It was poisoned. It was sour.
- And the crows came.

511
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,366
We couldn't grow anything.

512
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:13,035
- Where are the others?
- What others?

513
01:21:13,135 --> 01:21:16,597
- The Many Mothers.
- We're the only ones left.

514
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:18,955
Look.

515
01:22:20,868 --> 01:22:23,838
That's what you call a satellite.

516
01:22:23,938 --> 01:22:26,108
Miss Giddy told us about those.

517
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:30,146
They used to bounce messages
across the earth.

518
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:34,361
Shows. Everyone
in the old world had a show.

519
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,688
Do you think there's still
somebody out there?

520
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:44,559
- Sending shows?
- Who knows.

521
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:47,696
Those are the plains of silence.

522
01:22:49,596 --> 01:22:54,136
Stay right where you are, little Joe.
Kind of lost its novelty out here.

523
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:56,038
You having a baby?

524
01:22:56,938 --> 01:22:59,645
Warlord Jr. Gonna be so ugly.

525
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:03,010
It could be a girl.

526
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:07,949
- You kill people with that, do ya?
- Killed everyone I ever met out here.

527
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:10,619
Headshots, all of 'em.
Snap. Right in the medulla.

528
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,779
Thought somehow you girls
were above all that.

529
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,118
Come here.

530
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:27,902
Take a peek.

531
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:30,039
Seeds.

532
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:34,076
These are from home.
Heirlooms. The real thing.

533
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:37,780
- I plant one every chance I get.
- Where?

534
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,683
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

535
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:46,521
- So many different kinds.
- Trees, flowers, fruit.

536
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,591
Back then, everyone had their fill.

537
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:52,885
Back then, there was no need
to snap anybody.

538
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:09,768
Can I talk to you?

539
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:31,157
I've talked with the others.

540
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:41,271
We're never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

541
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:46,628
If we leave the rig here and load
the motorcycles up with as much as we can,

542
01:24:46,728 --> 01:24:50,084
we can maybe ride for 160 days.

543
01:24:51,883 --> 01:24:54,923
One of those bikes is yours.

544
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:57,560
Fully loaded.

545
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,234
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

546
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,613
I'll... I'll make my own way.

547
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:17,420
You know, hope is a mistake.

548
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:26,679
If you can't fix
what's broken, you'll...

549
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,916
you'll go insane.

550
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:49,134
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

551
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,474
<i>Where are you?</i>

552
01:25:52,574 --> 01:25:55,442
- <i>Help us.</i>
- <i>You promised to help us.</i>

553
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:08,601
<i>Come on, pa. Let's go.</i>

554
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,572
All right.

555
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,866
This is your way home.

556
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,770
We go back?

557
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:52,874
- Back?
- Yeah.

558
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:56,244
- I thought you weren't insane anymore.
- What are they saying?

559
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:58,747
He wants to go back
from where they came.

560
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:00,982
The Citadel.

561
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:03,028
And what's there to find at The Citadel?

562
01:27:03,128 --> 01:27:05,821
- Green.
- And water.

563
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:10,993
There's a ridiculous amount
of clear water. And a lot of crops.

564
01:27:11,093 --> 01:27:13,662
It's got everything you need,
as long as you're not afraid of heights.

565
01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:16,499
- Where does the water come from?
- He pumps it up from deep in the earth.

566
01:27:16,599 --> 01:27:18,934
Calls it Aqua Cola
and claims it all for himself.

567
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,470
And because he owns it,
he owns all of us.

568
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,105
I don't like him already.

569
01:27:23,205 --> 01:27:25,674
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the wall of mountains.

570
01:27:25,774 --> 01:27:30,729
No. I suggest we go back
the same way we came.

571
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,748
Through the canyon.

572
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:37,519
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.

573
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:41,690
So we take the war rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them.

574
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:44,726
We can decouple the tanker at the pass.

575
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:47,529
- Shut it off behind us.
- Kaboom!

576
01:27:50,464 --> 01:27:55,204
And how exactly do we take The Citadel?
Assuming we're still alive by then?

577
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:58,140
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

578
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:02,044
All that's left are his war pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.

579
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:06,454
And we'll be with Nux. He's a War Boy.

580
01:28:06,554 --> 01:28:09,242
He'll be bringing us home, bringing back
what's stolen, as he's meant to.

581
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:14,856
Yeah.

582
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,983
It feels like hope.

583
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:21,496
I like this plan. We can start again.

584
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:24,362
Just like the old days.

585
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:28,637
Look, it'll be a hard day.

586
01:28:28,937 --> 01:28:31,840
But I guarantee you
that 160 days ridin' that way,

587
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,251
there's nothin' but salt.

588
01:28:38,944 --> 01:28:42,651
At least that way,
you know, we might be able to...

589
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,287
together...

590
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:47,948
Come across some kind of redemption.

591
01:29:18,748 --> 01:29:22,302
War rig! That's the war rig!

592
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:35,037
- That's them.
- Why are they going back?

593
01:29:35,437 --> 01:29:37,954
Do they wish to surrender?

594
01:29:38,054 --> 01:29:41,099
They are heading for the canyon.

595
01:29:41,243 --> 01:29:44,379
They're going back to The Citadel!

596
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:48,016
- They know it's undefended!
- Bullocks!

597
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:01,488
Go!

598
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,620
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

599
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:28,848
- To who?
- Anyone that's listening.

600
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:55,412
Here we go, girls!

601
01:30:56,251 --> 01:30:58,078
That's mine!

602
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:04,718
He'll try to get in front of us,
spike our wheels.

603
01:31:11,266 --> 01:31:12,934
Don't blow my engine.

604
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:15,828
I'm gonna nudge him. Just a little.

605
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:31,044
You filth! You traitored him!

606
01:31:55,011 --> 01:31:56,871
Go.

607
01:32:22,367 --> 01:32:26,641
Got to back off. Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

608
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:28,342
Right.

609
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:30,145
Are you a black thumb?

610
01:32:30,245 --> 01:32:33,415
All right. Engine one now.
You and me, fifth wheel.

611
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:36,610
We'll unhook the tanker.

612
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:50,548
One man, one bullet.

613
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:08,216
- I cannot see.
- Maadi! Maadi!

614
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,609
I cannot see.

615
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:53,819
Hey! Harpoons and plows!
They're hauling us back!

616
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:07,600
Leave three bolts. Three.

617
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:27,121
Hey, you!

618
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:44,438
Are you okay?

619
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,801
I think she's hurt.

620
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:12,703
Hey!

621
01:36:38,593 --> 01:36:40,286
No!

622
01:36:49,444 --> 01:36:52,440
<i>Hey. Stay with me.</i>

623
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,309
- <i>Stay with me.</i>
- Stay with me.

624
01:36:54,409 --> 01:36:55,968
Hey. Are you there?

625
01:36:57,179 --> 01:36:59,839
You finish that! I'll finish her!

626
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:31,530
Valhalla!

627
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:43,985
Oi!

628
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:15,273
Engine one's good. For now.

629
01:40:02,647 --> 01:40:05,505
She's hurt! She's hurt real bad!

630
01:41:35,789 --> 01:41:39,093
You hear that?
We're gonna see two airborne V-8s.

631
01:41:40,593 --> 01:41:43,230
I'm gonna need you to drive.

632
01:41:44,465 --> 01:41:46,678
I'll get him out of our way.

633
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:55,551
Rictus!

634
01:42:55,651 --> 01:42:57,828
Take me!

635
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:12,945
Cheedo! What are you doing?

636
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:18,683
No!

637
01:43:22,897 --> 01:43:24,912
Big boy!

638
01:43:30,521 --> 01:43:32,431
Here! Here!

639
01:44:24,325 --> 01:44:25,769
No!

640
01:44:26,327 --> 01:44:28,187
Remember me?

641
01:44:48,938 --> 01:44:51,877
He's dead! He's dead.

642
01:45:10,771 --> 01:45:14,475
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

643
01:45:14,575 --> 01:45:15,595
Come on!

644
01:45:16,808 --> 01:45:20,426
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

645
01:46:06,927 --> 01:46:09,521
Witness me.

646
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,458
Rictus!

647
01:47:11,625 --> 01:47:15,862
- Why is she making that noise?
- She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

648
01:47:15,962 --> 01:47:19,992
She's collapsing her lungs
one breath at a time.

649
01:47:25,472 --> 01:47:27,298
I know.

650
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:32,138
I am so sorry.

651
01:47:33,851 --> 01:47:36,125
I know. I know.

652
01:47:36,225 --> 01:47:38,385
Hold it there.

653
01:47:38,485 --> 01:47:39,987
All right.

654
01:47:40,087 --> 01:47:42,589
Put that on there. Press it on.

655
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:46,351
- Hey. Hey.
- Home.

656
01:47:53,667 --> 01:47:55,927
Home.

657
01:48:00,707 --> 01:48:02,334
No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

658
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:05,009
She's exsanguinated.
Drained all her blood.

659
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:08,510
Hold these.

660
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:11,686
We need that. Thank you. Needle.

661
01:48:12,686 --> 01:48:14,568
Come on!

662
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:17,061
Take this.

663
01:48:18,944 --> 01:48:20,336
Keep her awake.

664
01:48:20,436 --> 01:48:21,587
Furiosa.

665
01:48:25,399 --> 01:48:28,102
Okay, that's not retracting.

666
01:48:28,202 --> 01:48:30,370
There we go.

667
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:33,355
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

668
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:35,388
Okay.

669
01:48:35,488 --> 01:48:37,533
Sorry.

670
01:48:38,345 --> 01:48:41,306
There you go. Okay. There you go.

671
01:48:53,427 --> 01:48:54,695
Max.

672
01:48:55,984 --> 01:48:58,489
My name is Max.

673
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:08,666
That's my name.

674
01:49:49,683 --> 01:49:51,640
Brake!

675
01:49:56,256 --> 01:49:58,841
Reveal yourself.

676
01:50:16,427 --> 01:50:17,769
He's got something.

677
01:50:24,519 --> 01:50:26,105
It's Immortan Joe.

678
01:50:26,205 --> 01:50:29,178
The Immortan Joe is dead!

679
01:50:55,282 --> 01:50:57,451
Furiosa!

680
01:51:01,688 --> 01:51:02,857
Furiosa!

681
01:51:03,257 --> 01:51:05,693
She's back.

682
01:51:15,299 --> 01:51:17,729
Let's do it! Let 'em up. Come on.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
