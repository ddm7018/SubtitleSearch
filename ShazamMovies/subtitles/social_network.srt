2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:20,387
Did you know there are more people with genius IQ's living in
China than there are people of any kind living in the US?

3
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,226
That can't possibly be true.
- It is.

4
00:00:22,226 --> 00:00:23,467
What would account for that?

5
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:26,347
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question:

6
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:30,067
How do you distinguish yourself in a population
of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's?

7
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:31,666
I didn't know they take SAT's in China.

8
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,906
They don't. I wasn't talking about China
anymore, I was talking about me.

9
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:35,186
You got a 1600?

10
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:39,386
Yes. I could sing in an acapella group, but I can't sing.
- Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong?

11
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:41,105
I could row crew, or invent a $25 PC.

12
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:42,305
Or you get into a final club.

13
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:43,505
Or I get into a final club.

14
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:47,306
You know, from a woman's perspective sometimes
not singing in an acapella group is a good thing.

15
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:50,345
This is serious.
- On the other hand I do like guys who row crew.

16
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:51,464
Well, I can't do that.

17
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:52,305
I was kidding.

18
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:53,865
Yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

19
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:56,464
Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

20
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:58,463
To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

21
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:00,465
To row crew? No.
Are you, whatever, delusional?

22
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:03,544
Maybe it's just sometimes you say two things at once
and I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at.

23
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:05,104
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

24
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:06,464
No.

25
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:08,063
OK, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world class athletes.

26
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:11,463
And a second ago you said you like guys who
row crew, so I assumed you had met one.

27
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:15,022
I guess I meant I liked the idea of it
in the way a girl likes cowboys.

28
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:16,463
OK.

29
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:19,423
Shall we get something to eat?
- Would you like to talk about something else?

30
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:24,703
No, it's just since the beginning of the conversation about
finals club, I think I may have missed a birthday.

31
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:28,582
There are really more people in China with
genius IQ's than the entire population of -

32
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:31,543
The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club...
Roosevelt punched the Porc.

33
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:32,502
Which one?

34
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:34,622
The Porcellian, the Porc,
it's the best of the best.

35
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:36,702
Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

36
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:41,741
Is it true they send a bus around to pick up girls
who want to party with the next Fed chairman?

37
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:42,901
So you can see why it's
so important to get in.

38
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,700
OK, well, which is the easiest to get into?

39
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:50,101
Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

40
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,180
None of them, that's the point.

41
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:55,940
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer...

42
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,260
...and Eduardo won't come close to getting in. The ability
to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,380
Must be nice.

44
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,779
He made $300,000 in a summer?

45
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:03,381
He likes meteorology.

46
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,460
You said it was oil futures.

47
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,380
You can read the weather, you
can predict the price of heating oil.

48
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,659
I think you asked me that because you think the final club
that's the easiest to get into, is the one where I'll have the best chance.

49
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:12,459
I... what?

50
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,819
You asked me which one was the easiest to get into
because you think that that's the one where I have the best chance.

51
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:20,419
The one that's easiest to get into would be the one
where anybody has the best chance.

52
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:24,018
You didn't ask which one was the best one,
you asked me which one was the easiest.

53
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:27,818
I was honestly just asking, OK?
I was just asking to ask.

54
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:29,618
Mark, I'm not speaking in code.

55
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:30,058
Erica -

56
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:36,698
You're obsessed with finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD.
You need to see someone about it who'll prescribe you medication.

57
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,138
You don't care if the side-effects may include blindness.

58
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:40,378
Final clubs.

59
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:41,578
Not finals clubs.

60
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:45,297
And there's a difference between being
obsessed and being motivated.

61
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:46,577
Yes...

62
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:47,817
...there is.

63
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:50,258
Well, you do. That was cryptic,
so you do speak in code.

64
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:50,977
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

65
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:54,337
I'm just saying I need to do something
substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.

66
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:54,976
Why?

67
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:56,536
Because they're exclusive.

68
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:58,736
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

69
00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:02,056
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected for president
because he was a member of the Phoenix Club.

70
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:03,856
He was a member of the
Porcellian, and yes, he did.

71
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:08,176
Well, why don't you concentrate on
being the best you, you can be.

72
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:09,496
Did you really just say that?

73
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,375
I was kidding.

74
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,656
Although just being straight
doesn't make it any less true.

75
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:16,335
I want to be straightforward and tell you that I
think you might want to be a little bit more supportive.

76
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:21,694
If I get in, I'll be taking you to the events and the gatherings,
and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet.

77
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:25,615
You would do that for me?

78
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:26,974
We're dating.

79
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:29,454
OK.

80
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:33,293
Well, I'm gonna try and be straightforward with
you and let you know that we're not anymore.

81
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:34,333
What do you mean?

82
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:35,814
We're not dating anymore, I'm sorry.

83
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:38,214
Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

84
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:39,294
You're breaking up with me?

85
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:42,373
You were going to introduce me to people
I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet.

86
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,613
What the f...
What is it supposed to mean?

87
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:45,853
Wait, settle down.

88
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:49,052
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink
is 'cause you used to sleep with the door guy.

89
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:55,053
"The door guy"...his name is Bobby. I have not slept with
"the door guy", "the door guy" is a friend of mine.

90
00:03:55,053 --> 00:04:00,492
And he is a perfectly good class of people.
And what part of Long Island are you from, Wimbledon?

91
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:01,932
Wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm room.

92
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:02,892
Wait, wait, is this real?
- Yes.

93
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:05,251
OK, then wait. I apologize, OK?
- I have to go study.

94
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:06,811
Erica.
- Yes?

95
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,452
I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

96
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:11,132
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

97
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,332
I can't.
- Why?

98
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:15,131
Because it's exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a stair master.

99
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,011
All I meant is that you're not likely to... currently.

100
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:21,610
I wasn't making a comment on your parents, I was
saying you go to BU. I was stating a fact, that's all...

101
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:24,010
...and if it seems rude, then of course I apologize.
- I have to go study.

102
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,850
You don't have to study.
- Why you keep saying I don't have to study?

103
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,211
Because you go to BU!

104
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:29,650
Want to get some food?

105
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,930
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

106
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,169
And I'm sorry I don't have a
rowboat. So we're even.

107
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,809
I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

108
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:40,930
I was just being polite,
I have no intention of being friends with you.

109
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,010
I'm under some pressure
right now from my OS class...

110
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,529
...and if we could just order
some food, I think we should -

111
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:49,609
OK, you're probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

112
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:54,728
But you're going to go through life thinking
that girls don't like you because you're a nerd.

113
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,249
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart, that that won't be true.

114
00:04:59,128 --> 00:05:01,728
It will be, because you're an asshole.

115
00:07:56,956 --> 00:08:01,595
<i>Erica Albright's a bitch. Do you think that's
because her family changed their name from Albrecht?</i>

116
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:03,995
<i>Or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?</i>

117
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:13,515
<i>For the record, she may look like a 34C, but she's getting
all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret.</i>

118
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:17,154
<i>She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.
False advertising.</i>

119
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,474
<i>The truth is, she has a nice face.</i>

120
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:23,395
<i>I need to do something to
take my mind off her.</i>

121
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:26,795
<i>Easy enough,
except I need an idea.</i>

122
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,554
<i>I'm a little intoxicated,
I'm not gonna lie.</i>

123
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:36,833
<i>So what if it's not even 10 P.M.
and it's a Tuesday night?</i>

124
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:42,033
<i>The Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop and some
of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics.</i>

125
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:48,592
<i>Billy Olsen's sitting here had the idea of putting some of the pictures
next to pictures of farm animals, and have people vote on who's hotter.</i>

126
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,233
<i>Good call, Mr. Olsen.</i>

127
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:57,993
<i>Yea, it's on.</i>

128
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:00,952
<i>I'm not gonna do the farm animals but I
like the idea of comparing two people together.</i>

129
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:07,391
<i>It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel since people's ratings
of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number...</i>

130
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,912
<i>...to represent each person's hotness
like they do on hotornot.com.</i>

131
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,352
<i>The first thing we're going to
need is a lot of pictures.</i>

132
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:15,870
<i>Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook,
so I'm going to have to get all the images...</i>

133
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,271
<i>...from the individual
houses that people are in.</i>

134
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,910
<i>Let the hacking begin.</i>

135
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:40,509
<i>First up is Kirkland. They keep everything open
and allow indexes in their Apache configuration...</i>

136
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:43,189
<i>...so a little Wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.</i>

137
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,749
<i>Kid's stuff.</i>

138
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:04,947
<i>Next is Elliot. They're also open but
with no indexes on Apache.</i>

139
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:08,387
<i>I can run an empty search, and it returns all
of the images in the database in a single page.</i>

140
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,587
<i>Then I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.</i>

141
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:11,227
<i>Excellent.</i>

142
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:12,827
<i>Moving right along.</i>

143
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,148
Excuse me - everybody!

144
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,386
You're at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs...

145
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:21,747
...not just at Harvard,
but in the world.

146
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:25,666
Now I want to welcome you all at
Phoenix' first party of the fall semester.

147
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:36,506
<i>Lowell has some security. They
require a username/password combo...</i>

148
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:41,545
<i>...and I'm going going ahead and say they don't have access to the
main FAS user database, so they have no way of detecting an intrusion.</i>

149
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:43,985
<i>Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to twenty a page.</i>

150
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,585
<i>All I need to do is breakout the same
script I used on Lowell, and we're set.</i>

151
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:50,825
<i>Quincy has no online
facebook, what a sham.</i>

152
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,744
<i>Nothing I can do about that.</i>

153
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:58,143
<i>Dunster is intense. Not only is there no
public directory, but there's no directory at all.</i>

154
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:00,185
<i>You have to do searches, and if your
search returns more then twenty matches...</i>

155
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:01,144
<i>...nothing gets returned.</i>

156
00:11:01,264 --> 00:11:05,744
<i>Once you do get results, they don't link directly to the
images, they link to a php that redirects or something.</i>

157
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:08,023
<i>Weird. This may be difficult,
I'll come back later.</i>

158
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:09,863
Hey, shark's week is on.
- What?

159
00:11:09,863 --> 00:11:11,023
Great white, beautiful fish.

160
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:15,783
<i>Leverett is a little better. They still use end search,
but you can do an empty search and get links to pages...</i>

161
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:16,823
<i>...with a every student's picture.</i>

162
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:19,023
<i>It's slightly obnoxious that they
let you view one picture at a time...</i>

163
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,582
<i>...and there's no way I'm going through five
hundred pages, to download pics one at a time.</i>

164
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,902
<i>So it's definitely necessary to break out
Emacs and modify that perl script.</i>

165
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:43,060
Done.

166
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:44,301
Hey, what's goin' on?

167
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:48,101
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here, and
he's going to have the key ingredient.

168
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:49,821
Hey Mark.
- Eduardo.

169
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:51,421
You and Erica split up.

170
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,261
How did you know that?

171
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,541
It's on your blog.

172
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,940
Yeah.

173
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,939
Are you alright?
- I need you.

174
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,300
I'm here for you.

175
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,219
No, I need the algorithm you
used to rank chess players.

176
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,539
Are you okay?

177
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,700
We're ranking girls.

178
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,299
You mean other students.

179
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:07,539
Yeah.

180
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,459
You think this is
such a good idea?

181
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:10,699
I need the algorithm.

182
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:18,218
<i>Give each girl a base rating of 1400.
At any given time Girl A has a rating Ra...</i>

183
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:20,779
<i>...and Girl B has a rating Rb.</i>

184
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,378
When any two girls are matched up, there's an expectation
of which will win based on their current rating, right?

185
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,738
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

186
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,578
Let's write it.

187
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:44,737
The one on the left.

188
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:46,817
On the right.

189
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:48,696
The right.

190
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:50,736
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

191
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,697
Dwyer.
- Neal.

192
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:52,976
Who are you gonna send it to?

193
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:57,816
Just a couple of people. Question
is, who are they gonna send it to?

194
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:27,294
Hey guys, check this out.

195
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:31,533
The one on the left.

196
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:32,413
These girls...

197
00:13:33,373 --> 00:13:34,253
Right or left?

198
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:34,973
Left.

199
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:38,694
Right or left.

200
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,134
That's my roommate.

201
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:43,373
All on the left.

202
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:45,733
This is pathetic.

203
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:46,733
Right.

204
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:48,012
Left.

205
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:49,812
Left.

206
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:56,292
Albright, he blogged about you.

207
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:58,772
You don't want to read it.

208
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:08,051
Erica, is this yours?

209
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:10,531
I stole it from a trainee.

210
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:11,851
Get the hell out of here.

211
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,690
That's an awful lot of traffic.

212
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,730
You think maybe we shouldn't shut
it down before we get into trouble?

213
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:38,369
Hello?

214
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:43,210
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

215
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:44,609
At four in the morning?

216
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,969
Well, there is a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch of Kirkland.

217
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:50,329
You're saying it's unusual
for four in the morning?

218
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:53,008
No, this would be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

219
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:54,968
Alright.

220
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:59,408
I gotta go in.

221
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,487
What's going on?

222
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:03,727
Harvard's network is about to crash.

223
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,247
You don't think...

224
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:13,967
I do.

225
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,647
God save us every bodies.

226
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:23,526
Can't connect.

227
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:26,006
The network's down.

228
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:29,366
Unless it's a coincidence,
I'd think this is us.

229
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:30,406
It's not a coincidence.

230
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:32,565
Holy shit.

231
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:38,205
So you were called in front of the ad board.

232
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:39,205
That's not what happened.

233
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:41,405
You weren't called in front of
the administrative board?

234
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:44,204
No, back at the bar with Erica Albright.

235
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:45,165
She said all that?

236
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,805
Mark.
- That I said that stuff to her?

237
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:48,844
I was reading from the
transcript of her deposition.

238
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:50,284
Why would you even
need to depose her?

239
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:51,644
That's really for us to decide.

240
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,484
You think if I know she could make me look
like a jerk I'll be more likely to settle.

241
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:55,124
Mark.

242
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:57,484
Why don't we stretch our legs for
a minute, can we do that?

243
00:15:57,604 --> 00:16:03,844
It's been almost three hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time
embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with the girl's testimony from the bar.

244
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,603
I am not embarrassed, she
just made a lot of that up.

245
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:06,564
She was under oath.

246
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:10,363
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

247
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,362
The site got 2,200
hits within two hours?

248
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:23,402
Thousand.

249
00:16:23,762 --> 00:16:24,441
What?

250
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,242
22,000.

251
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,241
These guys are just freaking' fast.

252
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,400
Is there any way to
make this a fair fight?

253
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:58,519
Jump out and swim.

254
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,039
We'd have to jump out and drown.

255
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,640
You could row forward
and I could row backward.

256
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,759
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

257
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,039
Just row the damn boat.

258
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:18,277
You guys hear about this?
- What?

259
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:22,358
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop of Kirkland.

260
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:23,998
At four A.M.

261
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:27,838
He set up a website where you vote
for the hotness of female undergrads.

262
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:30,357
What were we doing, that
none of us heard about this?

263
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,437
I don't know, a three hour low
rate technical row before breakfast?

264
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:34,918
Full course load studying.

265
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:36,758
Another three hours in
the tank, then studying.

266
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:38,277
Not sure how we missed it.

267
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:40,197
How much activity
was there on this thing?

268
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,757
Twenty-two thousand
page requests.

269
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:43,156
Twenty-two thousand?

270
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:45,756
This guy hacked the
facebook of seven houses.

271
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:48,796
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

272
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:49,716
Twenty-two thousand?

273
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,316
How you know he was drunk?

274
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:53,597
He was blogging, simultaneously.

275
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:55,316
You know what I think?

276
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:56,516
Way ahead of you.

277
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,196
This is our guy.

278
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:05,035
Cameron WINKLEVOSS.
Cameron spelled the usual way.

279
00:18:05,154 --> 00:18:10,035
Tyler WINKLEVOSS. Tyler spelled the usual way,
and my last name is the same as my brother's.

280
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,674
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative board hearing.

281
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:19,914
You're being accused of intentionally breaching security,
violating copyrights, violating individual privacy...

282
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:23,635
<i>...by creating the website www.facemash.com.</i>

283
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:28,394
You're also charged with being in violation of university
policy on distribution of digitized images.

284
00:18:28,514 --> 00:18:32,393
Before we begin with our questioning, you're allowed
to make a statement. Would you like to do so?

285
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:40,233
You know, I've already apologized in
<i>The Crimson</i>, to the AVHW...

286
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:45,113
...to Fuerza Latina, and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted, as I take it that they were.

287
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,872
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security...

288
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:51,312
...I believe I deserve some recognition from this board.

289
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:54,712
I'm sorry?

290
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,952
Yes.

291
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:57,712
I don't understand.

292
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:58,272
Which part?

293
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,591
You deserve recognition.

294
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,751
I believe I pointed out some pretty
gaping holes in your system.

295
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,351
Excuse me, may I?

296
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:11,591
Mr. Zuckerberg. I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network...

297
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:13,911
...and I can assure you of its sophistication.

298
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:17,710
In fact, it was that level of sophistication,
that led us to you in less then four hours.

299
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,230
Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

300
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,310
That would be impressive, except if you'd known what you are looking
for you would've seen it written on my dorm room window.

301
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,269
So?
- Six months Academic probation.

302
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:34,829
Wow, they had to make an example out of you.

303
00:19:34,829 --> 00:19:35,549
They had my blog.

304
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:38,588
I shouldn't have written nothing about the
farm animals, that was stupid.

305
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:42,029
But I was kidding for God's sakes,
doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

306
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:44,869
I tried to stop you.
- I know.

307
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:47,988
How do you do this thing were you
manage to get all girls to hate us?

308
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,468
Why do I let you?
You can't do that.

309
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:52,187
Eduardo, I said I know.

310
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:54,027
OK, let's look at a sample problem.

311
00:19:54,387 --> 00:20:00,068
Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-bit
virtual address, and a page size of 256 bytes.

312
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:05,187
The system uses one-level page
tables that start at address 0x0400.

313
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,547
Maybe you want DMA on
your 16-bit system, who knows.

314
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:12,146
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, et cetera.

315
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,987
Assume page table entries
have eight status bits.

316
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,346
The eight status bits would
then be... Anybody?

317
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:22,706
Ah, I see we have our first surrender.

318
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:26,265
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg, brighter men
than you have tried and failed this class.

319
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:30,426
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit, five permission bits.

320
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,305
That is correct.

321
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:36,985
Does everybody see
how he got there?

322
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:42,984
Mark?

323
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,545
You Mark Zuckerberg?

324
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:46,024
Yea.

325
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:47,785
Cameron Winklevoss.

326
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:48,705
Hi.

327
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:49,944
Tyler Winklevoss.

328
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:51,264
Are you guys related?

329
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,144
That's good, funny, never heard that before.

330
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:57,503
So what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

331
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,343
No... actually... hang on.
- We never asked.

332
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:00,903
Maybe we should have.
- No.

333
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,383
We have an idea we want to talk to you about.

334
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:05,543
Got a minute?

335
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,543
You guys look like you guys
spend some time at the gym.

336
00:21:08,783 --> 00:21:09,423
We have to.

337
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:09,982
Why?

338
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,182
We row crew.

339
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:14,102
Yeah, I've got a minute.

340
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:15,102
Great.

341
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:20,862
So you ever been inside the Porcellian?

342
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:21,262
No.

343
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:23,742
We're sorry. We can not take you past the
bike room 'cause you're not a member.

344
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:29,141
Want a sandwich, or something?

345
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,741
Uh, OK.

346
00:21:30,861 --> 00:21:31,621
Mark, right?

347
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:32,222
Yea.

348
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:34,581
Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

349
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:38,700
We were really impressed with Facemash.
We checked you out, you also built Course Match.

350
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:40,341
Don't know no Course Match.

351
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,220
You can go online and see what
courses your friends are taking.

352
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:43,500
Really smart man.

353
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,060
Mark?

354
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,621
Yeah?

355
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:48,901
We were talking about Course Match.

356
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,140
It was kind of a no-brainer.

357
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,300
You invented something
in high school too, right?

358
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,820
An app for an MP3 player, that
recognizes your taste in music.

359
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,259
Any body try to buy it?

360
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:00,499
Microsoft.

361
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,739
How much?
- Didn't sell it, uploaded it for free.

362
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:06,619
For free?
- Yeah.

363
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:07,459
Why?

364
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:14,858
OK, we have something we have been working on for a while,
and we think it's great. It's called the Harvard Connection.

365
00:22:14,978 --> 00:22:17,537
You can create your own page,
interests, bio, friends, pics.

366
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,179
Then people can go online
and see your bio...

367
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,339
Request you -

368
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,738
Yeah, how is that different
from <i>MySpace</i> and <i>Friendster?</i>

369
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,777
HARVARD.EDU

370
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:30,217
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country.

371
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:32,177
And the whole site is based
on the idea that girls -

372
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:35,618
Not to put anything indelicately.
- Girls want to go with guys who go to Harvard.

373
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:39,057
See, my brother doesn't have
trouble putting things indelicately.

374
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:42,816
Main difference between what we're talking about and <i>MySpace</i>
or <i>Friendster</i>, or any of those other social networking sites -

375
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:44,057
- Is exclusivity.

376
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:45,536
Right?

377
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:46,696
Right.

378
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,776
Yeah, we'd love you to work with us, Mark.

379
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:50,496
We need a gifted programmer who is creative.

380
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,176
And we know you've been
taken to the shitters.

381
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:54,216
Women's groups are still
ready to declare a fatwa.

382
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:58,055
This could help
rehabilitate your image.

383
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,695
Wow - you would do that for me.

384
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,335
We'd like to work with you.

385
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:07,175
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

386
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,735
Our second programmer just got
overwhelmed with school work.

387
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,895
We would need you to build the site,
write the code and we'll provide all -

388
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:13,815
I'm in.

389
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:15,854
What?

390
00:23:17,454 --> 00:23:18,094
I'm in.

391
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:19,413
Awesome.

392
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:21,213
That's what you said?

393
00:23:22,053 --> 00:23:24,414
It was three or four years ago,
I don't know what I said.

394
00:23:24,494 --> 00:23:25,854
When did you come to Eduardo?

395
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:27,573
I don't understand that question.

396
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:29,653
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

397
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:31,093
The affirmative?

398
00:23:31,213 --> 00:23:33,652
When I did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

399
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:35,492
It was called TheFacebook then.

400
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:37,612
This doesn't need
to be that difficult.

401
00:23:37,692 --> 00:23:39,973
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

402
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:46,532
Did you answer affirmatively when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra ask you to build Harvard Connection?

403
00:23:46,573 --> 00:23:48,332
Did you say yes?

404
00:23:48,732 --> 00:23:49,571
I said I'd help.

405
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:52,971
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for TheFacebook?

406
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:54,452
I wouldn't say I approached him.

407
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:55,132
Sy?

408
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:56,612
You can answer the question.

409
00:23:56,732 --> 00:23:58,972
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

410
00:23:59,411 --> 00:24:01,891
What's that?
- The Jewish fraternity.

411
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:05,571
It was Caribbean night.

412
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,969
Is there something here that guys
are generally attracted to Asian girls?

413
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:27,570
Because Asian girls generally
are attracted to guys like me.

414
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,690
I'm developing an algorithm to define the
connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

415
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:33,529
I don't think it's that complicated -
they're hot, they're smart.

416
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:36,129
They are not Jewish
and they can dance.

417
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:37,728
Hey, Mark's here!

418
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:38,729
Mark!

419
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:52,607
I think I've come
up with something.

420
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,327
Hang on, I've got to tell you
something you're not going to believe.

421
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,208
- What.
I got punched by the Phoenix.

422
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:02,607
Are you kidding?
- No, it's the first of a four-step process.

423
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:05,087
But they slipped the invitation
under my door tonight.

424
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,687
I'm on my first punch
party tomorrow.

425
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:09,686
You got punched
by the Phoenix.

426
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:15,926
Yea, it's probably just a diversity thing,
just ride that horse 'til...

427
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:17,246
What did you want to
talk to me about?

428
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:20,165
Mark, you said you've
come up with something.

429
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,566
Yeah, I think I've come up
with something. Come outside.

430
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:23,925
It's twenty degrees outside.

431
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:28,365
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls, which
has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean.

432
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:41,484
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

433
00:25:41,964 --> 00:25:43,804
It wasn't because they
saw pictures of hot girls.

434
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:45,645
You can go anywhere on the
internet and see pictures of hot girls.

435
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:48,885
Because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

436
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:54,483
People want to go on the Internet and check out their friends, so
why not build a website that offers that: friends, pictures, profiles...

437
00:25:54,603 --> 00:25:58,243
...whatever you can visit browse around,
maybe someone you just met at a party.

438
00:25:58,363 --> 00:26:00,404
But I'm not talking
about a dating site.

439
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:04,123
I'm talking about taking the
entire social experience of college...

440
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:05,683
...and putting it online.

441
00:26:05,923 --> 00:26:08,243
I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

442
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:09,963
I'm totally psyched about
this too, but Eduardo...

443
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:12,442
<i>It would be exclusive.</i>

444
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:16,362
You would have to know the people on
the site to get past your own page, like...

445
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,242
...getting punched.
- That's good.

446
00:26:19,242 --> 00:26:21,722
Eduardo, it's like a Final Club,
except we're the president.

447
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:23,802
I told him I thought it sounded great.

448
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:26,441
It was a great idea.

449
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:30,801
There was nothing to hack. People were gonna
provide their own pictures, their own information.

450
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,601
And people had the ability to invite
or not invite their friends to join.

451
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:39,201
In a world were social
structure was everything...

452
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,600
...that was THE thing.

453
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,440
It was a big project, and he was going to have
to write tens of thousands of lines of code.

454
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,040
So I wondered why he was coming
to me and not his room mates.

455
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,520
Dustin Moskovitch and Chris Hughes,
they were programmers.

456
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,079
We're gonna need a little startup cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

457
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:56,840
So that was why.

458
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,119
Did he offer terms?

459
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,559
We'll split it 70/30.

460
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,679
Seventy for me, thirty for you for putting up the $1000,
and for handling everything on the business end.

461
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,439
You're CFO.

462
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,639
And you said?

463
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:07,839
I said, <i>let's do it.</i>

464
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,558
OK, did he add anything else?
- Yes.

465
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:16,838
It probably was a diversity thing.

466
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,718
But so what?

467
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:21,398
Why you think he said that?

468
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:23,638
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

469
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:26,157
Sy, if you let me continue
with my line of questioning.

470
00:27:26,157 --> 00:27:28,437
They're suggesting I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix, and...

471
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:31,436
...began a plan to screw him out of
a company I hadn't even invented yet.

472
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:32,716
- Were you?
- Gretchen!

473
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:34,757
- Jealous of Eduardo!
- Stop typing, we're off the record.

474
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:37,277
Ma'am, I know you've done you're homework
and so you know money is not a big part of my life...

475
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:41,556
...but at the moment I could buy Mount Auburn street,
take the Phoenix club and turn it into my ping-pong room.

476
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,036
I'll let you know
how the party is.

477
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:58,555
We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one suit
involving Facebook, and a witness in another.

478
00:27:58,555 --> 00:27:59,035
Yes, sir.

479
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:02,234
At any time in the weeks prior
to Mark's telling you his idea...

480
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:07,195
...did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron
Winklevoss, Divya Narendra, or Harvard Connection?

481
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:10,394
Yes. He said they asked
him to work on their site.

482
00:28:10,394 --> 00:28:13,274
But that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

483
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:17,274
He said even his most pathetic friends
knew more about getting people interested...

484
00:28:17,394 --> 00:28:18,754
...in the website than these guys.

485
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:20,673
These guys, meaning my clients.

486
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:21,273
Yes.

487
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:23,554
Yes, he resented, Mark resented that...

488
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:27,274
...they, your clients that he thought that he
needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash.

489
00:28:27,393 --> 00:28:29,953
Mark didn't want to rehabilitate
anything. With Facemash...

490
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:33,312
...he hacked into the Harvard computers,
he thumbed his nose at the ad board.

491
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:36,712
He got a lot of notoriety. Facemash
did exactly what he wanted it to do.

492
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:41,433
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building
TheFacebook, he was also communicating with the plaintiffs?

493
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,073
Not at the time I wasn't.

494
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,952
It really did not have much to do
with the Winklevoss's dating site.

495
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:49,871
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

496
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:53,471
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building TheFacebook...

497
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:56,751
...he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

498
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,551
- You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

499
00:28:58,551 --> 00:29:00,391
- We're about to
find it in evidence.

500
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:05,550
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler
Winklevoss, November 30, 2003.

501
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,870
<i>I read over all the stuff you sent
me RE: HARVARD CONNECTION...</i>

502
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,031
<i>...and it seems like it shouldn't
take to long to implement.</i>

503
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:15,390
<i>So we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night.</i>

504
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,149
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron
Winklevoss, December 1, 2003.

505
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,790
<i>Sorry I was unreachable tonight.</i>

506
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,870
<i>I just got about three of your missed calls,
I was working on a problem for my Systems class.</i>

507
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:30,669
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and
Cameron Winklevoss, December 10, 2003.

508
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:33,748
<i>This week has been pretty busy,
between Harvard, classes and work.</i>

509
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:36,068
<i>So I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting.</i>

510
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:38,388
<i>I'm also really busy tomorrow.</i>

511
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:41,468
OK, anybody else feel like
there is something up with this guy?

512
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,228
Tell him OK.

513
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,149
But we do have to make sure we
meet up before we go off for a break.

514
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:49,907
I know, I know.
Yeah, well, ciao.

515
00:30:19,266 --> 00:30:19,825
Hey, Mark.

516
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:23,026
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MYSQL backend

517
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:24,465
It's gonna cost a little more.

518
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:25,145
How much more?

519
00:30:25,145 --> 00:30:26,185
About two hundred more.

520
00:30:26,664 --> 00:30:27,545
Do we need it?

521
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:29,746
Gotta handle the traffic.

522
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:33,985
Do it.
- I already did.

523
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,424
Hey, guess what.

524
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:42,504
I made the second cut.

525
00:30:43,623 --> 00:30:44,143
That's good.

526
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:47,544
You should be proud of that right there,
don't worry if you don't make it any further.

527
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:53,663
I'll get out of here.

528
00:30:54,063 --> 00:30:56,463
From Mark Zuckerberg to
Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss...

529
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:57,663
… and Divya Nevendra.

530
00:30:57,783 --> 00:30:59,623
Dec 15, 2003.

531
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:05,823
<i>I have a CS problem set that I am just getting started with and
it should be about 15 hours of coding, so I'll be busy tomorrow night.</i>

532
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:08,742
<i>I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon.</i>

533
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,182
<i>I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.</i>

534
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,302
<i>I've basically been in
the lab this whole time.</i>

535
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:18,142
<i>And I also won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents.</i>

536
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:24,181
As the plaque reads,
this is John Harvard.

537
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,981
Founder of Harvard
University in 1638.

538
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:28,901
It's also called the
statue of three lies.

539
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,861
What are the three lies?

540
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:33,582
Mr. Dowd.

541
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:36,060
The three lies.
First -

542
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:37,301
Shit.

543
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:38,101
Take your pants off.

544
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:39,180
I know.

545
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,100
Ah, Mr. Saverin.

546
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,660
1 - Harvard was founded in 1636.

547
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,700
Not 1638.

548
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,219
2 - Harvard was not
founded by John Harvard.

549
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:48,700
3 - That is not John Harvard.

550
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,500
Who is it?

551
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,299
Friend of the sculptor Daniel Chester.

552
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:56,100
Keep your jacket on.

553
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:03,219
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients...

554
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,899
...and he still hadn't completed
work on Harvard Connection.

555
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,259
But on January 11, 2004...

556
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:15,657
<i>...Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain
name TheFacebook, by Network Solutions.</i>

557
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:20,818
To the best of your knowledge, had he
even begun work on Harvard Connection?

558
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:23,018
Not to my knowledge.

559
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:23,817
No.

560
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:36,097
<i>Hey Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical that we have
enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention...</i>

561
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:39,336
<i>...and gain the critical mass necessary
to get a site like this to run.</i>

562
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:42,136
<i>We'll speak soon?</i>

563
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:46,776
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem.

564
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:47,456
Yes, it was.

565
00:32:47,456 --> 00:32:49,416
You sent thirty-six e-mails...

566
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:50,336
...to Mr. Zuckerberg...

567
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,216
...and received sixteen
e-mails in return...

568
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:54,895
...and this is the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

569
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:55,695
That's correct.

570
00:32:55,815 --> 00:32:58,455
He had forty-two days to study our
system and get out ahead.

571
00:32:58,455 --> 00:33:00,495
Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you -

572
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:02,455
Did I use any of your code?

573
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:04,214
You stole our whole
goddamn idea!

574
00:33:04,254 --> 00:33:04,734
Fellas.

575
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:07,694
- Match.com for Harvard guys?
- Can I continue with my deposition?

576
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:10,215
You know you really don't need a forensics
team to get to the bottom of this.

577
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:12,335
If you guys were the
inventors of Facebook...

578
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:14,734
...you would have invented Facebook.

579
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:18,613
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.

580
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:19,773
No shit.

581
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,694
Let's continue.

582
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:27,094
February 4, 2004.

583
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:31,093
Mark?

584
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:32,733
Mark?

585
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,373
There is a girl in your art history class.

586
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:38,653
Her name is Stephanie Attis, do you
happen to know if she has a boyfriend?

587
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:42,493
Have you ever seen
her with anyone?

588
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:47,331
And if not, do you happen to know if
she's looking to go out with me one night?

589
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:47,892
Dustin...

590
00:33:49,852 --> 00:33:53,611
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says,<i> I'm...</i>

591
00:33:57,811 --> 00:33:58,331
Mark.

592
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:26,330
Supposed to meet at nine.

593
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:27,530
Slept yet?

594
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,409
Have to add something.

595
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:30,049
What?

596
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:43,449
Shit, that looks good, really good.

597
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:45,048
Clean and simple,
no Disneyland.

598
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:46,768
No live nude girls.
Watch.

599
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:49,408
What are you writing?

600
00:34:49,928 --> 00:34:51,807
<i>Relationship status</i>

601
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:53,047
<i>Interested in</i>

602
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:54,726
This is what drives life at college:

603
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:55,847
Are you having sex, or aren't you...

604
00:34:55,847 --> 00:34:58,647
...is why people take certain
classes and sit where they sit...

605
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:01,207
...and do what they do, and
add some center, you know...

606
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:03,247
...that's what TheFacebook will be
about. People are going to log on...

607
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:06,406
...because after all the cake and watermelon
there is a chance they're actually gonna -

608
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:07,726
- Gonna get laid?

609
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:08,646
- Meet a girl.
Yes.

610
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,126
- That is really good.
- And that was it.

611
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:12,006
- What do you mean?

612
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:14,046
- It's ready.
- It's ready, right now?

613
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:14,926
Yeah. Have a seat.

614
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,886
And here is the masthead.
- You made a masthead?

615
00:35:18,006 --> 00:35:18,406
Yeah.

616
00:35:18,926 --> 00:35:21,165
<i>Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO</i>

617
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:21,725
Yeah.

618
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:23,845
You have no idea what that's
going to mean to my father.

619
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:24,565
Sure, I do.

620
00:35:27,484 --> 00:35:28,725
So when is it going live?

621
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:30,966
Right now.

622
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:32,485
Get your laptop out.

623
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:34,484
What, why do we need my laptop?

624
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,364
Because you got e-mails of
everybody at the Phoenix.

625
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:44,884
I'm not sure if it's going to be
cool with them that I'm...

626
00:35:44,964 --> 00:35:45,845
...gonna spam their -

627
00:35:46,164 --> 00:35:47,124
This is not spam.

628
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:48,124
No, I know it's not spam.

629
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:50,803
If we send it to our friends, it's just
gonna bounce around our dorm.

630
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:51,683
I haven't got in yet.

631
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,323
These guys know people...

632
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:54,443
...and I need their e-mails.

633
00:35:56,482 --> 00:35:57,323
Sure, good.

634
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:00,362
Give me the mailing list.

635
00:36:00,402 --> 00:36:02,523
<i>jabberwock12@listserver.harvard.edu</i>

636
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:03,563
These guys.

637
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:07,203
They're literary geniuses 'cause of the world's
most obvious Lewis Carroll references.

638
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:09,122
They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

639
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:10,282
Yeah, you're right.

640
00:36:16,882 --> 00:36:18,122
The site's live.

641
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:21,442
You know, let's go get
a drink and celebrate.

642
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:23,681
I'm buying.

643
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,401
Mark?

644
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,360
Mark, are you praying?

645
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,039
Whatever happened to Cole
Porter and Irving Berlin?

646
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
It's a Valentine's Day theme,
they're playing love songs.

647
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,360
Good point, 'cause Cole Porter and
Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs.

648
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,318
Honey, you should
put your laptop away.

649
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,999
Just having different people
spam me the same link.

650
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:00,678
Casey...

651
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:02,599
What is it?
- I don't know...

652
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:07,838
I'm really hoping it's cats that look like Hitler,
'cause I can never get enough of that.

653
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:09,678
No, it's not.

654
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:13,757
Div?

655
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:16,277
What?

656
00:37:23,798 --> 00:37:26,077
Hey, w-what is wrong?

657
00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:30,117
It's fine.

658
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:47,035
Hey!

659
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:47,835
- Not now.

660
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:49,635
We need twenty minutes.

661
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:55,235
OK, I just want to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

662
00:37:56,475 --> 00:38:00,035
Mark Zuckerberg.
He stole our website.

663
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:03,274
It's been live for more
than thirty-six hours.

664
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:08,435
Mr. Hotchkiss.

665
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:09,994
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with dad.

666
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:13,074
I'm here with my brother Tyler
and my business partner Divya.

667
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:15,353
<i>"Welcome to TheFacebook.
TheFacebook is an online directory...</i>

668
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:17,873
<i>...that connects people through
different social networks..."</i>

669
00:38:17,873 --> 00:38:19,993
<i>"You must have a Harvard.edu
address to register..</i>

670
00:38:20,033 --> 00:38:20,673
That's right, yes sir.

671
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,834
I called earlier. I'm looking
for Mark Zuckerberg.

672
00:38:22,954 --> 00:38:25,113
Yes, sir he's actually quoted
a couple of times...

673
00:38:25,113 --> 00:38:25,434
...I can read it to you.

674
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:27,713
<i>"Everyone is talking a lot about
Universal Facebook within Harvard..."</i>

675
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,193
He says, he, meaning Mark.

676
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:32,512
<i>"I think it's kind of silly that it would take the
university a couple of years to get around to it."</i>

677
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:34,312
<i>"I can do a classier job than they can."</i>

678
00:38:34,432 --> 00:38:35,072
<i>"And I did it..."</i>

679
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:44,152
<i>As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said over
650 students had registered to use Thefacebook.com...</i>

680
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:47,111
<i>He said he anticipated that nine hundred
students would join the site by this morning."</i>

681
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:50,631
Yes, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

682
00:38:50,751 --> 00:38:54,792
God, if I was a drug dealer, I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in a day.

683
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:56,951
This guy doesn't have three
friends to rub together...

684
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:57,871
...to make a fourth.

685
00:38:57,871 --> 00:38:59,951
Alright yes, that's what
we'll do Mr. Hotchkiss...

686
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,350
...we'll put it all together
and well e-mail it to you.

687
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,710
You won't be able to go
on the website yourself.

688
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,790
Because you don't have a Harvard...

689
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,030
You know, it would just be
easier for us to e-mail it to you.

690
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,990
I'm sure you're right. He is a good guy, and
he's very bright and I'm sure he didn't mean to...

691
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,550
Wow.

692
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,230
What he did.

693
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,470
Thank you very much and dad...

694
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:19,349
I love you too.

695
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:20,309
This is a good guy?

696
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:21,589
We don't know that
he's not a good guy.

697
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:22,788
We know he stole our idea.

698
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:23,789
We know lied to our faces...

699
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:24,508
...for a month and a half.

700
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:25,589
No, he never lied to our faces.

701
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,949
OK, he never saw our faces, fine.
He lied to our e-mail accounts...

702
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,029
...and he gave himself a
forty-two day head start.

703
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:31,988
Because he knows what apparently you don't...

704
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,708
...which is that getting
there first, is everything.

705
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:37,388
I'm a competitive racer, Dave. I don't think you need
to school me on the importance of getting there first.

706
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,908
Thank you.
- Alright.

707
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,868
That was your father's lawyer?
- His in-house counsel.

708
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:43,468
He is going to look at all this, and if he thinks it's
appropriate, he's going to send a cease and desist letter.

709
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,948
What's that gonna do?
- What, you want to hire an IP lawyer and sue him?

710
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:49,107
No, I want to hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

711
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:51,187
We're not going to have to do that.
- That's right.

712
00:39:51,227 --> 00:39:53,866
We can do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5'', 220, and there's two of me.

713
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:56,827
Whatever, I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

714
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,028
How much more information
are you waiting for?

715
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:01,787
We met with Mark three times,
we've exchanged fifty-two e-mails...

716
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,066
...we can prove that
he looked at the code.

717
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,906
What is that on the
bottom of the page?

718
00:40:04,906 --> 00:40:06,026
<i>A Mark Zuckerberg production</i>

719
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:09,066
On the home page?
- On every page.

720
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:12,066
Shit, I need a second to let
that classiness waft over me.

721
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:15,985
They wrote Zuckerberg said he hoped the
privacy options would help restore his reputation...

722
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:18,386
<i>...following student outrage over Facemash.com.</i>

723
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:20,425
It's exactly what we said to him.

724
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:22,545
<i>He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.</i>

725
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:26,504
While we are waiting for dad's lawyer to look this stuff over
we can at least get something going in the paper.

726
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:30,345
- No.
- So people know that this is in dispute.

727
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:33,185
We're not starting a knife fight in The Crimson,
and we're not suing anybody.

728
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:33,984
Why not?

729
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:37,024
I don't understand, why not?

730
00:40:38,344 --> 00:40:39,664
He's gonna say it's stupid.

731
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:41,543
Me?

732
00:40:42,104 --> 00:40:43,103
Say it, why not?

733
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:46,424
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

734
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:50,784
This is Harvard, were you don't plant stories,
and you don't sue people.

735
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:54,023
You thought he was gonna be the
only one who thought that was stupid?

736
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:57,342
During the time when you
say you had this idea...

737
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:00,742
...did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

738
00:41:01,223 --> 00:41:02,663
A family of means?

739
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:04,743
Did you know their
father was wealthy?

740
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,302
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

741
00:41:07,302 --> 00:41:09,102
It's not important.
You be sure why I'm asking.

742
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:10,022
Not important to you.

743
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:10,982
Sy.

744
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:13,621
Did you know that they
came from money?

745
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:16,021
I had no idea whether they
came from money or not.

746
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:21,182
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra, you
referenced Howard Winklevoss's consulting firm.

747
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:21,982
If you say so.

748
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:25,861
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm
whose assets are in the hundreds of millions.

749
00:41:25,981 --> 00:41:30,740
You also knew Tyler and Cameron were members
of a Harvard final club called The Porcillian.

750
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,860
They pointed that out.

751
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,181
Excuse us for inviting you in.

752
00:41:33,301 --> 00:41:34,101
To the bike room.

753
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,020
So it's safe to say you were
aware that my clients had money.

754
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,379
Yes.

755
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,380
Let me tell you why I'm asking, I'm wondering
why, if you needed a thousand dollars...

756
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,859
...for an internet venture you
didn't ask my clients for it.

757
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:49,540
They had demonstrated an interest
to you in that kind of thing.

758
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,260
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

759
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:57,659
Eduardo was the President of the Harvard Investors
Association, and he was also my best friend.

760
00:41:57,738 --> 00:42:01,018
Your best friend is suing you
for six hundred million dollars.

761
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:02,618
I didn't know that, tell me more.

762
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,859
Eduardo, what happened after the initial launch?

763
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:08,459
I'm sorry Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

764
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,898
Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.

765
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:15,777
We already went through this on the... never mind.
Mr. Saverin, what happened after the initial launch?

766
00:42:15,777 --> 00:42:16,618
It exploded.

767
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:21,378
Everybody on campus was using it. <i>Facebook me</i>.
It was the common expression after two weeks.

768
00:42:22,257 --> 00:42:22,977
And eh, Mark?

769
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:24,977
And Mark was the biggest thing on campus...

770
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:28,016
...that included nineteen Nobel laureates
and fifteen Pulitzer Prize winners,...

771
00:42:28,016 --> 00:42:31,216
...two future Olympians,
and a movie star.

772
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:32,536
Who's the movie star?

773
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:33,856
Does it matter?

774
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:34,976
No.

775
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:21,013
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

776
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:22,453
Yeah.

777
00:43:22,692 --> 00:43:23,813
He made Facebook?

778
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:26,413
Yeah. I mean,
it's both of ours, but...

779
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:32,053
Cool. I am a Chrisy, this is Alice.

780
00:43:34,452 --> 00:43:35,212
Very nice to meet you.

781
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:38,892
Facebook me if you get home,
maybe we all can go out and grab a drink.

782
00:43:39,412 --> 00:43:41,292
Certainly, can absolutely do that.

783
00:43:48,731 --> 00:43:51,611
She said, <i>Facebook me</i>,
and we can all go for a drink.

784
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,451
Which is stunningly great
for two reasons.

785
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:55,731
One, she said <i>Facebook me</i>, right?
And the other -

786
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:56,851
- They want to have drinks later.

787
00:43:56,971 --> 00:44:00,411
Yes, have you ever heard so many different good
things packed into one regular-sized sentence?

788
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,210
Excuse me, Mark?

789
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:03,290
Yeah.

790
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,650
I am Stewart Singer,
I'm in you're OS class.

791
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:06,529
Sure.

792
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:09,730
Awesome job with TheFacebook.
- Awesome job.

793
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,289
Thanks.

794
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,250
I'm Bob.

795
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:12,730
How are you doing?

796
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,930
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you...

797
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,170
...when he said "the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room."

798
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:17,890
I doubt it.

799
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:21,049
I showed up late. I don't even
know who the speaker was.

800
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:23,169
It was Bill Gates.

801
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:26,049
Shit, that makes sense.

802
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:28,569
Alright, thanks guys.

803
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:33,488
You a moron?
- You medically stupid?

804
00:44:33,488 --> 00:44:36,848
You don't recognize Bill Gates when
he's in front of you for an hour?

805
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:40,087
I'm gonna get a
Glock and kill you.

806
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:42,288
Time to monetize the thing.

807
00:44:42,648 --> 00:44:43,688
What were their names?

808
00:44:44,088 --> 00:44:44,808
Heard what I just said?

809
00:44:44,928 --> 00:44:45,487
What?

810
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:47,687
I said it's time to monetize the site.

811
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,687
What does that mean?

812
00:44:49,807 --> 00:44:52,527
It means, it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

813
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:55,446
I know the what the word means,
I'm asking how you want to do it.

814
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:56,966
Advertising.

815
00:44:56,966 --> 00:44:58,007
No.

816
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:00,447
Well, we got four
thousand members.

817
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:01,607
Because TheFacebook is cool...

818
00:45:01,607 --> 00:45:03,847
...and if we start selling pop-ups for
Mountain Dew it's not gonna be cool -

819
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:05,246
- Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain
Dew, but at some point...

820
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:08,166
...I am talking as the business
end of the company.

821
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:11,565
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know... what it is.

822
00:45:11,726 --> 00:45:16,285
We don't know what it can be, we don't
know what it will be, we know that it is cool.

823
00:45:16,326 --> 00:45:17,725
That is a priceless asset
I'm not giving up.

824
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:20,045
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

825
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:21,765
That's the point, the way
fashion's never finished.

826
00:45:22,165 --> 00:45:23,804
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

827
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,524
You're talking about fashion?
Really, you -

828
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:28,084
I'm talking about the idea of it,
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

829
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:30,404
OK, but they manage to make
money selling pants.

830
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,725
Mark, what is this?

831
00:45:34,084 --> 00:45:35,644
What?
- This.

832
00:45:35,644 --> 00:45:37,164
It's called a cease
and desist letter.

833
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:37,844
What were their names?

834
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:39,764
Who?
- The girls.

835
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:44,483
When did you get this?
- About ten days ago, right after we launched the site.

836
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:47,363
They're saying the Winklevoss twins are
saying that you stole their idea.

837
00:45:47,363 --> 00:45:49,404
I find that to be a little
more than mildly annoying.

838
00:45:49,404 --> 00:45:52,403
They find it to be
intellectual property theft.

839
00:45:52,403 --> 00:45:55,323
Why didn't you show this to me?
- It was addressed to me.

840
00:45:55,483 --> 00:45:58,802
They're saying we stole TheFacebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevoss -

841
00:45:58,802 --> 00:46:00,762
I know what it says.
- Did we?

842
00:46:00,762 --> 00:46:01,643
Did we what?

843
00:46:01,643 --> 00:46:03,802
Don't screw around with
me now. Look at me.

844
00:46:03,842 --> 00:46:05,482
The letter says we could
face legal action.

845
00:46:05,482 --> 00:46:07,162
<i>No, it says I could face legal action.</i>

846
00:46:07,162 --> 00:46:09,481
This is from a lawyer, Mark, they
must feel they have some grounds.

847
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:12,162
The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

848
00:46:12,162 --> 00:46:15,201
The grounds are: our thing is cool, and popular,
and Harvard Connection is lame.

849
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:18,762
Eduardo, I didn't use any of their code.
I promise I didn't use anything.

850
00:46:18,762 --> 00:46:21,961
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair doesn't owe
money to everyone who's ever built a a chair.

851
00:46:21,961 --> 00:46:24,081
Look, they came to me with
an idea, I had a better one.

852
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,680
Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

853
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,721
If there is something wrong...

854
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:35,520
If there is ever anything wrong...

855
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,760
...you can tell me.

856
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,079
I'm the guy that wants to help.

857
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,240
This is our thing.

858
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,399
Now, is there anything
you need to tell me?

859
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,559
No.

860
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,879
What are we doing about this?

861
00:46:48,879 --> 00:46:52,199
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services,
and they told me to write them back.

862
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:53,119
And what did you say?

863
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:56,358
<i>When we met in January, I
expressed my doubts about the site.</i>

864
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:59,918
<i>Where it stood with graphics, how much
programming was left that I had not anticipated.</i>

865
00:47:00,038 --> 00:47:05,318
<i>The lack of hardware, we had to deal with a site that lacked
promotion, then go on to successfully launch the website.</i>

866
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:09,038
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

867
00:47:09,038 --> 00:47:10,437
I'd raised concerns before.

868
00:47:10,437 --> 00:47:12,598
Bullshit.
- Not to us.

869
00:47:12,598 --> 00:47:16,117
I'm talking about the meeting in
January to which this letter is referring.

870
00:47:16,237 --> 00:47:16,637
Yeah.

871
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:18,317
Let me rephrase this.

872
00:47:18,437 --> 00:47:20,957
You sent my client
sixteen e-mails...

873
00:47:20,957 --> 00:47:23,597
...in the first fifteen,
you didn't raise any concerns.

874
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:24,717
Is that a question?

875
00:47:24,837 --> 00:47:28,157
In the sixteenth e-mail you raised
concerns about the site's functionality.

876
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:30,556
Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

877
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:33,755
Then why didn't you raise any
of these concerns before?

878
00:47:34,035 --> 00:47:34,915
It's raining.

879
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:35,716
I'm sorry?

880
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:36,676
It just started raining.

881
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:39,836
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?

882
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:42,076
No.

883
00:47:43,036 --> 00:47:45,355
Do you think I deserve it?
- What?

884
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:47,675
Do you think I deserve
your full attention?

885
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:52,236
I had to swear an oath before we began this
deposition and I don't want to perjure myself...

886
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,195
...so I have a legal
obligation to say no.

887
00:47:54,195 --> 00:47:55,354
OK, no.

888
00:47:56,154 --> 00:47:57,875
You don't think I
deserve your attention.

889
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,634
I think if your clients want
to sit on my shoulders...

890
00:47:59,634 --> 00:48:03,074
...and call themselves tall, they have a right
to give it a try, but there is no requirement...

891
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:05,753
... that I enjoy sitting here,
listening to people lie.

892
00:48:05,954 --> 00:48:08,754
You have part of my attention,
you have the minimum amount.

893
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:11,553
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook...

894
00:48:11,553 --> 00:48:13,913
...where my colleagues and I are doing
things that no one in this room...

895
00:48:13,913 --> 00:48:14,754
...including and
especially your clients...

896
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:18,113
...are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

897
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:22,992
Did I adequately answer your
condescending question?

898
00:48:29,432 --> 00:48:33,432
I have 12:45, why don't
we say that's lunch.

899
00:48:34,552 --> 00:48:35,751
Back at 2:30.

900
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,511
So, what were their names?

901
00:48:40,272 --> 00:48:42,392
Their names were Christie and Alice.

902
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:47,751
And they want to have drinks, tonight.

903
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,749
I don't care.

904
00:49:35,988 --> 00:49:39,547
Hey man, sorry. A couple of
girls are freshing up in there.

905
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:43,428
Sweet.

906
00:49:46,508 --> 00:49:49,347
We have groupies.

907
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,786
I'll be right back.

908
00:49:57,506 --> 00:49:59,307
Mark, where you going?
Mark?

909
00:50:04,306 --> 00:50:05,106
Erica?

910
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:08,025
Hi.

911
00:50:08,025 --> 00:50:11,185
I saw you from over there, I didn't
know you came to this cupboard.

912
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:14,426
First time.
- Mine too, can I talk to you alone for a second?

913
00:50:15,786 --> 00:50:18,425
I think I'm good right here.
- I just...

914
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:21,665
I'd love to talk to you alone,
If we could go some place.

915
00:50:21,705 --> 00:50:23,224
Right here is fine.

916
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:26,904
I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched?
- No.

917
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:28,824
<i>- TheFacebook?<i>
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

918
00:50:29,304 --> 00:50:31,025
That's why I wanted to talk to you -

919
00:50:31,384 --> 00:50:32,225
On the Internet -

920
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:33,464
That is why I came over -

921
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,144
Comparing women to farm animals?

922
00:50:35,144 --> 00:50:38,343
I didn't end up doing that.
- Didn't stop you from writing it.

923
00:50:38,343 --> 00:50:41,343
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head is so clever...

924
00:50:41,343 --> 00:50:43,423
...it would be a crime
for it not to be shared.

925
00:50:44,463 --> 00:50:46,263
The Internet is not
written in pencil, Mark...

926
00:50:46,263 --> 00:50:49,663
...it's written in ink. And you published
that Erica Albright was a bitch...

927
00:50:49,663 --> 00:50:52,863
...right before you made an ignorant
crack about my family's name...

928
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:56,502
...my bra size, then rated
women based on their hotness.

929
00:50:56,622 --> 00:50:58,501
Erica, is there a problem?

930
00:50:58,622 --> 00:50:59,582
No, there's no problem.

931
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:04,502
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room,
because that's what the angry do nowadays,

932
00:51:05,702 --> 00:51:08,662
I was nice to you,
don't torture me for it.

933
00:51:08,662 --> 00:51:12,661
If we could just go somewhere for a minute.
- I don't want to be rude to my friends.

934
00:51:12,661 --> 00:51:14,101
- OK.
- OK.

935
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,461
Good luck with your...
video game.

936
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:23,021
Hey, that was great, that was the right
thing to do. You apologized, right?

937
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,700
We have to expand.

938
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,580
You want more?

939
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,019
Is he mad about something?

940
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:35,140
OK, we are expanding to
Yale and Columbia.

941
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,379
Dustin, I want you to show the coding work with me.
Chris, you are in charge of publicity and outreach...

942
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:40,459
...and you can start by getting us
a story in the BU newspaper...

943
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:41,139
<i>...it's The Bridge.</i>

944
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,020
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

945
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,179
Somebody at the newspaper will be a
computer science major, tell him...

946
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:47,019
...Mark Zuckerberg will do
ten hours of free programming.

947
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:48,820
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

948
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,299
Because I do. Now here's
the arrangement:

949
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:52,218
Eduardo is CFO and owns
thirty percent of the company.

950
00:51:52,299 --> 00:51:55,978
Dustin is a vice-president and head of programming,
and his five percent of the company will come from my end.

951
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:00,218
Chris is director of publicity, and his compensation
will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing.

952
00:52:00,338 --> 00:52:02,617
Any questions?
- Who are the girls?

953
00:52:02,898 --> 00:52:04,098
Sorry, they are
Christie and Alice.

954
00:52:04,177 --> 00:52:05,218
Hi.
- Hi.

955
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:06,658
Hello.
- Hi.

956
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:08,738
Is there anything we can do?

957
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:09,977
No, that's it.

958
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,338
Yale and Columbia. let's go.

959
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:12,258
- And Stanford.

960
00:52:12,937 --> 00:52:14,497
What?
- Stanford.

961
00:52:15,057 --> 00:52:17,177
It is time for them
to see this in Palo Alto.

962
00:52:22,257 --> 00:52:23,257
You don't want any lunch?

963
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:24,417
No.

964
00:52:25,496 --> 00:52:27,176
You're welcome to some salad.

965
00:52:27,296 --> 00:52:27,856
No, thank you.

966
00:52:34,896 --> 00:52:35,976
This must be hard.

967
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:37,856
Who are you?

968
00:52:38,576 --> 00:52:40,856
I'm Marylin Delpy,
I introduced myself -

969
00:52:40,976 --> 00:52:42,375
I mean what do you do?

970
00:52:42,495 --> 00:52:44,695
I am a second year
associate at the firm.

971
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:46,815
My boss wanted me to sit
in on the deposition phase.

972
00:52:48,814 --> 00:52:49,535
What are you doing?

973
00:52:49,974 --> 00:52:52,415
Checking to see how
it's going in Bosnia.

974
00:52:53,015 --> 00:52:53,815
Bosnia.

975
00:52:54,335 --> 00:52:55,934
They have no roads
but they have Facebook.

976
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:05,133
You must really hate the Winklevosses?

977
00:53:05,574 --> 00:53:06,653
I don't hate anybody.

978
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:11,014
The Winklevosses are suing me
for intellectual property theft.

979
00:53:11,014 --> 00:53:13,253
They're suing me because for
the first time in their lives...

980
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:15,693
...things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

981
00:53:23,373 --> 00:53:24,533
He's expanding.

982
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:25,773
What?

983
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:28,253
<i>To Yale, Columbia and Stanford.
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow.</i>

984
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:30,052
Really?
- Yeah.

985
00:53:30,052 --> 00:53:33,012
Well, it looked like the cease and desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh.

986
00:53:33,051 --> 00:53:35,892
- I want to hire a lawyer to fall from injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.

987
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,931
Every minute the site is up
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

988
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:41,771
I want an injunction, I want
damages, I want punitive relief.

989
00:53:41,891 --> 00:53:42,651
And I want him dead.

990
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:43,731
Yeah, I want those things too.

991
00:53:43,772 --> 00:53:45,251
Then why aren't we
doing anything about it?

992
00:53:45,251 --> 00:53:48,891
Because we are gentlemen of Harvard?
- Because you're not thinking about how it's gonna look.

993
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:49,811
How's it gonna look?

994
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,730
Like my brother and I in skeleton costumes
chasing the karate kid around the high school gym.

995
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:53,210
Cam.

996
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:56,451
He has violated Massachusetts
State law.

997
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:59,451
When he goes to Connecticut, New York
and California he will have violated federal law.

998
00:53:59,571 --> 00:54:01,730
By the way, he's in
violation of Harvard law.

999
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,570
There's no such
thing as Harvard law.

1000
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,049
Wait. Yeah...

1001
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:06,369
There is.

1002
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,450
Harvard student hand book.

1003
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:13,329
Every freshman is
issued one of these.

1004
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:16,049
Somewhere in this book it says -
- You can't steal from another student.

1005
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:18,888
This is what we need.

1006
00:54:19,969 --> 00:54:22,008
You can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1007
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:23,528
My brother and I we
pay tuition at this school.

1008
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:25,448
We carry a 3.9 GPA.

1009
00:54:25,688 --> 00:54:26,648
We won trophies for this school.

1010
00:54:26,768 --> 00:54:28,848
And well be rowing in
the Olympics for this school.

1011
00:54:28,968 --> 00:54:31,048
I want a meeting with the
goddamn president of this school.

1012
00:54:32,568 --> 00:54:33,208
Why Stanford?

1013
00:54:34,368 --> 00:54:35,607
Why do you think?

1014
00:54:41,287 --> 00:54:43,087
Sorry, I'm late for bio-chem.

1015
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:44,807
OK.

1016
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:49,166
You don't know my name, do you?

1017
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:51,087
Is it Stanford?

1018
00:54:51,486 --> 00:54:53,046
I should just kick your ass.

1019
00:54:53,446 --> 00:54:54,726
How do you go to a party?

1020
00:54:55,046 --> 00:54:57,406
Amelia Ritter,
but you prefer Amy.

1021
00:54:58,126 --> 00:54:59,126
You're from Olinda.

1022
00:54:59,126 --> 00:55:02,086
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's ten years sober.

1023
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:03,406
What's my major?

1024
00:55:04,086 --> 00:55:04,965
Trombone.

1025
00:55:05,085 --> 00:55:05,686
Really.

1026
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:08,046
I remember something
about a trombone.

1027
00:55:08,046 --> 00:55:10,525
<i>Tu as fait l'amour
à la jolie fille.</i>

1028
00:55:10,965 --> 00:55:14,405
French, your major is French.

1029
00:55:14,486 --> 00:55:15,365
And yours?

1030
00:55:15,365 --> 00:55:18,165
- Mine? I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

1031
00:55:19,005 --> 00:55:21,845
I don't go to school.
- You're kidding.

1032
00:55:22,005 --> 00:55:22,964
No.

1033
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:24,244
Where did you
go to school?

1034
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:27,044
William Taft Elementary,
for a little while.

1035
00:55:27,204 --> 00:55:27,964
Seriously...

1036
00:55:28,003 --> 00:55:30,884
...you're not like fifteen years
old or anything, are you?

1037
00:55:30,604 --> 00:55:34,844
No... You're not
fifteen, are you?

1038
00:55:36,604 --> 00:55:38,283
So what do you do?

1039
00:55:39,283 --> 00:55:40,403
I am an entrepreneur.

1040
00:55:41,403 --> 00:55:42,323
You're unemployed.

1041
00:55:42,563 --> 00:55:44,643
I wouldn't say that.
- What would you say?

1042
00:55:44,643 --> 00:55:47,563
That I'm an entrepreneur.
- Well, then what was your latest preneur?

1043
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:51,682
Well, I founded an Internet company that let
folks download and share music for free.

1044
00:55:52,123 --> 00:55:53,043
Kind of like Napster?

1045
00:55:53,162 --> 00:55:54,643
Exactly like Napster.

1046
00:55:54,922 --> 00:55:55,522
What do you mean?

1047
00:55:56,442 --> 00:55:57,761
I founded Napster.

1048
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:59,802
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1049
00:55:59,922 --> 00:56:00,921
Nice to meet you.

1050
00:56:01,603 --> 00:56:02,522
You're Sean Parker?

1051
00:56:02,522 --> 00:56:04,602
Uh huh, you see the shoes
on the other...

1052
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:05,401
- Foot?

1053
00:56:05,522 --> 00:56:06,882
...table, which just turned.

1054
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:09,522
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1055
00:56:09,522 --> 00:56:11,521
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1056
00:56:11,841 --> 00:56:12,921
You're a zillionaire.

1057
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:13,721
Not technically.

1058
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:14,641
What are you?

1059
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,600
Broke.

1060
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,601
There's not a lot of money in free music, even less when
you're being sued by anyone who's ever been to the Grammies.

1061
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:22,480
This is blowing my mind.

1062
00:56:22,601 --> 00:56:23,601
I appreciate that.

1063
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:25,400
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1064
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,560
Bio-chem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

1065
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,839
You passed.
- I'm a hard worker.

1066
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,879
There's juice. Anything else
you can find, help yourself.

1067
00:56:37,399 --> 00:56:39,319
Mind if I check my e-mail?
- Yeah, go ahead.

1068
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:50,159
Amy.

1069
00:56:54,118 --> 00:56:54,598
Amy.

1070
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:56,318
Can you come out here?

1071
00:56:57,198 --> 00:56:58,118
Just a second.

1072
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:03,118
There a snake in here, Amy.

1073
00:57:03,118 --> 00:57:03,677
What?

1074
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:07,078
Where?

1075
00:57:07,078 --> 00:57:08,717
OK there is no snake but I need to ask you something.

1076
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:11,077
Are you kidding me, I
could have been killed.

1077
00:57:11,357 --> 00:57:12,557
How?

1078
00:57:12,557 --> 00:57:15,397
By running too fast, and
getting twisted in the curtain.

1079
00:57:15,956 --> 00:57:17,036
What do you need to ask me?

1080
00:57:17,036 --> 00:57:19,756
I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

1081
00:57:20,797 --> 00:57:24,796
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on TheFacebook for a little bit.

1082
00:57:24,796 --> 00:57:26,277
What's that?
- TheFacebook?

1083
00:57:26,397 --> 00:57:29,236
Stanford's had it for
like two weeks now.

1084
00:57:29,236 --> 00:57:32,515
It's really awesome, except
it's freakishly addictive.

1085
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,115
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1086
00:57:35,115 --> 00:57:37,796
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?
- Yeah, is everything okay?

1087
00:57:38,036 --> 00:57:39,076
Everything's great.

1088
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:44,915
I just need to find
you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1089
00:57:48,314 --> 00:57:49,754
Ever been in this building before?

1090
00:57:49,874 --> 00:57:52,675
This building's a hundred years
older than the country it's in.

1091
00:57:52,795 --> 00:57:54,154
So do be careful.

1092
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:56,955
We're sitting in chairs.

1093
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:58,354
Yes.

1094
00:57:59,834 --> 00:58:00,394
Very good.

1095
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:02,354
You can go in now.

1096
00:58:13,353 --> 00:58:15,193
Catherine, I've got students now.

1097
00:58:15,313 --> 00:58:17,192
Students.
Undergrads.

1098
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:21,752
Don't know, from the looks of it they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1099
00:58:23,512 --> 00:58:24,593
Good morning.
- Good morning, sir

1100
00:58:24,593 --> 00:58:26,313
I'm Cameron Winklevoss,
this is my brother Tyler.

1101
00:58:26,313 --> 00:58:28,272
And you're here because?

1102
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:33,672
Either of you can answer.
- I'm sorry sir, I thought you were reading the letter.

1103
00:58:33,672 --> 00:58:34,511
Read the letter.

1104
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,711
<i>Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection.</i>

1105
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,751
We since changed the
name to ConnectU...

1106
00:58:38,871 --> 00:58:40,351
...and Mark Zuckerberg
stole that idea and -

1107
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:41,232
I understand.

1108
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,271
I'm asking what you want
me to do about it?

1109
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:44,311
Well, sir...

1110
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,710
In the Harvard student handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman...

1111
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:50,271
<i>...under the heading Standards of
Conduct in the Harvard community...</i>

1112
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,830
...it says the college expects
all the students to be honest...

1113
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,471
...and forthcoming in their dealings
with members in this community.

1114
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:58,910
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership...

1115
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,030
...and instances of theft,
misappropriation -

1116
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:01,510
- Anne?

1117
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:02,270
Yes, sir?

1118
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,110
Punch me in the
face, go ahead.

1119
00:59:07,029 --> 00:59:07,709
Or...

1120
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:09,509
...unauthorized use will result in...

1121
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:10,950
...disciplinary action...

1122
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:12,949
...including required withdrawal
from the college.

1123
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,989
You memorized that
instead of doing what?

1124
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:16,708
What my brother and I came...

1125
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,229
...here to ask you respectfully.

1126
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:21,508
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from other students, plain and simple.

1127
00:59:21,628 --> 00:59:22,668
You've spoken to your house master.

1128
00:59:22,668 --> 00:59:23,348
Yes, sir.

1129
00:59:23,348 --> 00:59:26,789
And the house master made a recommendation to the
Ad board but the Ad board won't hear us.

1130
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:28,388
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1131
00:59:28,388 --> 00:59:32,468
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our
e-mails and phone calls for the last two weeks.

1132
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,467
He doesn't answer when we
knock on his door at Kirkland.

1133
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:36,147
And the closest I've come to
dealing with him face to face...

1134
00:59:36,147 --> 00:59:39,083
...was when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1135
00:59:39,107 --> 00:59:41,306
- Chased him?
I, I, I saw him and I know he saw me, I went after him....

1136
00:59:41,306 --> 00:59:42,428
...and he disappeared

1137
00:59:42,548 --> 00:59:44,627
I don't see this as a university issue.

1138
00:59:44,627 --> 00:59:46,187
Of course this is a university issue.

1139
00:59:46,307 --> 00:59:48,587
There's a code of ethics and an honor
code and he violated them both.

1140
00:59:48,587 --> 00:59:51,627
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1141
00:59:52,186 --> 00:59:56,146
I'm sorry president Summers, what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1142
00:59:56,266 --> 00:59:56,906
I'm devastated by that.

1143
00:59:56,906 --> 00:59:58,146
What my brother means is...

1144
00:59:58,146 --> 01:00:00,746
... If Mark Zuckerberg walked into our
dorm room and stole our computer...

1145
01:00:00,866 --> 01:00:02,146
...that would be a university issue.

1146
01:00:02,146 --> 01:00:04,266
I don't know, this office
doesn't handle petty larceny.

1147
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:05,385
This isn't petty larceny.

1148
01:00:05,385 --> 01:00:07,625
This idea is potentially
worth millions of dollars.

1149
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:08,785
Millions!
- Yes.

1150
01:00:08,825 --> 01:00:11,064
You might just be letting your
imaginations run away with you.

1151
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:11,625
Sir...

1152
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:14,105
I honestly don't think you're in
any position to make that call.

1153
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:15,945
I was the US Treasury secretary.

1154
01:00:16,065 --> 01:00:17,785
I'm in some position
to make that call.

1155
01:00:17,825 --> 01:00:19,864
Letting our imagination
run away with us...

1156
01:00:19,864 --> 01:00:21,905
...is exactly what we were told
to do in your freshman address.

1157
01:00:21,905 --> 01:00:24,464
Well, then I would suggest that
you let your imaginations...

1158
01:00:24,464 --> 01:00:25,944
...run away with you
on a new project.

1159
01:00:25,944 --> 01:00:26,384
You would?

1160
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:28,703
Everyone at Harvard's inventing something.

1161
01:00:28,823 --> 01:00:33,304
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1162
01:00:33,304 --> 01:00:36,743
So I suggest again that the two of
you come up with a new, new project.

1163
01:00:36,743 --> 01:00:38,463
I'm sorry, sir, but that's
not the point.

1164
01:00:38,463 --> 01:00:38,903
Please...

1165
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:39,943
...arrive at the point.

1166
01:00:39,943 --> 01:00:43,503
You don't have to be a intellectual property expert
to understand the difference between right and wrong.

1167
01:00:43,582 --> 01:00:44,782
You're saying that I don't...

1168
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:46,784
Of course I am not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that...

1169
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,583
Really?
- Sir?

1170
01:00:48,862 --> 01:00:49,382
Anne.

1171
01:00:49,503 --> 01:00:50,743
How did I get this appointment?

1172
01:00:50,743 --> 01:00:52,022
Colleagues of their father.

1173
01:00:54,022 --> 01:00:56,462
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss...

1174
01:00:56,462 --> 01:00:58,461
...since you're on the
subject of right and wrong.

1175
01:00:58,581 --> 01:01:00,342
This action, this meeting...

1176
01:01:00,342 --> 01:01:02,942
...the two of you
being here, is wrong.

1177
01:01:03,062 --> 01:01:04,342
It's not worthy of Harvard.

1178
01:01:04,462 --> 01:01:06,381
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1179
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:08,541
You don't get special treatment.

1180
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,581
- We never asked.

1181
01:01:09,821 --> 01:01:11,101
Just start another project...

1182
01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:13,421
...like were making a
diorama for a science fair?

1183
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,301
- If you have a problem with
that, Mr. Winklevoss...

1184
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:15,980
- We never asked for
special treatment.

1185
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,901
- The courts are always
at your disposal.

1186
01:01:18,301 --> 01:01:19,661
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

1187
01:01:19,661 --> 01:01:21,780
- You could take the Harvard handbook and shove -
- Ty.

1188
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:23,860
Thank you very much
for your time, sir.

1189
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:30,699
Oops.

1190
01:01:31,259 --> 01:01:33,620
Broke your 335-year
old door knob.

1191
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,140
Eduardo, spring break you and
Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1192
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:38,699
Yes.

1193
01:01:38,739 --> 01:01:40,379
What was the purpose of the trip?

1194
01:01:40,779 --> 01:01:42,299
Well, as CFO...

1195
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:44,979
...I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers...

1196
01:01:45,218 --> 01:01:46,179
Who paid for the trips?

1197
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:49,259
It was paid for out of the $1,000
account I set up a few months earlier.

1198
01:01:49,259 --> 01:01:52,978
At this point your thousand dollars was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1199
01:01:52,978 --> 01:01:53,578
Yes.

1200
01:01:53,578 --> 01:01:54,898
How did you feel
the meetings went?

1201
01:01:56,378 --> 01:01:57,058
They went terribly.

1202
01:01:57,178 --> 01:01:58,098
Why?

1203
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:00,818
Mark was asleep.
- I was not asleep.

1204
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:02,457
Can I rephrase my answer?

1205
01:02:02,577 --> 01:02:04,137
I wish he'd been asleep.

1206
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:10,697
So we're at 29 schools now
with over 75,000 members.

1207
01:02:11,217 --> 01:02:15,417
People who go on TheFacebook tend to stay
on longer then almost any other website.

1208
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:17,536
Now here's the most
impressive statistic:

1209
01:02:17,616 --> 01:02:20,376
Ninety-one percent of the people who try it
once, come back. Now, if you'll allow me...

1210
01:02:20,376 --> 01:02:23,216
Excuse me one second. What sound
is he making, is that like a tsk?

1211
01:02:26,656 --> 01:02:27,896
It wasn't a tsk...

1212
01:02:28,496 --> 01:02:29,096
...it was...

1213
01:02:30,495 --> 01:02:31,775
...like a glottal stop.

1214
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:34,255
Almost a gag reflex.

1215
01:02:36,136 --> 01:02:37,016
Just what is this?

1216
01:02:37,696 --> 01:02:40,215
There was one more meeting
scheduled for the New York trip.

1217
01:02:40,335 --> 01:02:40,695
Yes.

1218
01:02:40,936 --> 01:02:41,655
It was a dinner.

1219
01:02:41,775 --> 01:02:43,255
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.

1220
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:45,774
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1221
01:02:46,335 --> 01:02:47,015
Yes.

1222
01:02:47,854 --> 01:02:48,494
Very.

1223
01:02:48,494 --> 01:02:50,414
They're not gonna card us.

1224
01:02:50,414 --> 01:02:51,094
Look around.

1225
01:02:51,214 --> 01:02:51,894
It will be embarrassing.

1226
01:02:52,175 --> 01:02:53,894
Tell him they're
not gonna card us.

1227
01:02:54,015 --> 01:02:55,334
They're not gonna card us.

1228
01:02:55,334 --> 01:02:55,695
Mark.

1229
01:02:55,695 --> 01:02:57,054
Are you gonna talk
about ads again?

1230
01:02:57,054 --> 01:03:00,854
Unless you're the Ballet Theater of Hartford,
the purpose of a business is to make a profit.

1231
01:03:00,854 --> 01:03:02,053
It isn't a business yet.

1232
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:02,773
That's tough...

1233
01:03:02,893 --> 01:03:04,493
That's tough for me, cause my job...

1234
01:03:05,253 --> 01:03:05,813
Never mind.

1235
01:03:08,573 --> 01:03:09,893
He's twenty-five minutes late.

1236
01:03:09,893 --> 01:03:11,933
He founded Napster
when he was nineteen.

1237
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:12,613
He can be late.

1238
01:03:12,613 --> 01:03:13,333
He's not a God.

1239
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:14,212
What is he?

1240
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:15,733
He's twenty-five minutes late.

1241
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:17,092
I think Edward is jealous.

1242
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:18,853
I honestly wasn't jealous.

1243
01:03:19,412 --> 01:03:20,412
I was nervous.

1244
01:03:20,532 --> 01:03:21,172
Why?

1245
01:03:21,452 --> 01:03:22,452
I didn't know him at all.

1246
01:03:22,572 --> 01:03:26,012
But I had done a search
and asked around and he...

1247
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:29,092
...he struck me as a kind of a...

1248
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,292
...a wild card.

1249
01:03:31,412 --> 01:03:32,251
Why?

1250
01:03:32,332 --> 01:03:37,251
He crashed out of two pretty big Internet companies in
spectacular fashion, he has a reputation with drugs.

1251
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:38,611
He also founded the companies.

1252
01:03:38,611 --> 01:03:39,851
We don't need him.

1253
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:41,851
He's here.

1254
01:03:44,811 --> 01:03:46,251
No, no, no, take your time.

1255
01:03:46,251 --> 01:03:49,130
And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1256
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:51,450
I'm Sean Parker.

1257
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:51,970
How do you do?

1258
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:54,330
You must be Eduardo.
And Christy, and Mark.

1259
01:03:54,489 --> 01:03:55,690
Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1260
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:58,091
You guys don't have
anything in front of you.

1261
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:58,810
No.

1262
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:00,049
- Tori.
- We were waiting.

1263
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:00,809
Hey, baby boy.

1264
01:04:00,809 --> 01:04:04,329
Could you bring out some things? The
lacquered pork with that ginger confit.

1265
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:07,169
Tuna tartar, and the lobster
claws, that'll get us started.

1266
01:04:07,169 --> 01:04:07,889
Christie...

1267
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:09,128
...what do you like to drink?

1268
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:11,650
An appletini.

1269
01:04:11,729 --> 01:04:13,769
Great.
Four of those.

1270
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:16,929
From that point on,
it was a Sean-a-thon.

1271
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:27,729
The question was what
did you talk about?

1272
01:04:38,927 --> 01:04:41,287
He took us through his
episode with Napster.

1273
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:44,007
I didn't want to spend my twenties
as a professional defender.

1274
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:46,807
Who knew the music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor?

1275
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:52,845
We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said
we owed in royalties, but I guess to them that was a little like...

1276
01:04:52,845 --> 01:04:55,286
...selling a stolen car to
pay for the stolen gas.

1277
01:04:55,286 --> 01:04:56,966
So we said screw it...

1278
01:04:56,966 --> 01:04:57,965
...and declared bankruptcy.

1279
01:04:57,965 --> 01:05:00,206
- You made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry. Tori!

1280
01:05:01,206 --> 01:05:02,086
- No good.

1281
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:04,685
Then he went on to his
second business venture...

1282
01:05:04,765 --> 01:05:08,285
...which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1283
01:05:08,285 --> 01:05:13,925
And I wanted to do it nice this time. I put on a tie and shined
my shoes, but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1284
01:05:13,925 --> 01:05:17,045
So let me tell you what happens to a
twenty-year old on the top of a hot dot.com.

1285
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:18,364
I'm not a psychiatrist, but...

1286
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:19,844
- We got that on the record.

1287
01:05:19,964 --> 01:05:21,844
You're not a psychiatrist,
but what?

1288
01:05:22,124 --> 01:05:24,843
A psychiatrist would
say that he was paranoid.

1289
01:05:24,843 --> 01:05:27,244
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1290
01:05:27,244 --> 01:05:29,443
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1291
01:05:29,443 --> 01:05:31,803
I can't prove it, but I know
they tapped my phones.

1292
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,283
Whatever it is that's gonna trip
you up, you've done already.

1293
01:05:34,283 --> 01:05:37,043
Private behavior is a
relic of a time gone by...

1294
01:05:37,043 --> 01:05:39,883
...and if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama but...

1295
01:05:39,883 --> 01:05:41,203
...they'll make shit up because...

1296
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,322
...they don't want you,
they want your idea...

1297
01:05:43,322 --> 01:05:45,763
...and they want you to
say thank you while you,...

1298
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:46,603
...excuse me,

1299
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:48,203
...wipe your chin and walk away.

1300
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:49,403
That's what happened to you?

1301
01:05:49,483 --> 01:05:50,762
And delusional.

1302
01:05:51,642 --> 01:05:52,082
Yes.

1303
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:53,082
What?

1304
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:56,801
There'll be payback at Case. It brought down
the record companies with Napster and...

1305
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:58,521
...Case will suffer for their sins too.

1306
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:00,161
Sorry, you didn't bring
down the record companies.

1307
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:01,281
They won.

1308
01:06:01,441 --> 01:06:02,002
- In court.

1309
01:06:02,282 --> 01:06:02,761
- Yeah.

1310
01:06:03,401 --> 01:06:05,361
Do you want to buy a
Tower Records, Eduardo?

1311
01:06:08,161 --> 01:06:10,241
He told story after story about...

1312
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:12,840
...life in Silicon Valley,
parties at Stanford...

1313
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:15,440
...down in LA, friends who'd
become millionaires..

1314
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,120
...but mostly how Mark had to,
he had to come to California.

1315
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,200
And then he cut around to TheFacebook.

1316
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,320
So tell me about your progress.

1317
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,719
Well, were in twenty-nine schools now.

1318
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,559
We got over 75,000 members.

1319
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:30,719
Tell me about the
strategy you're using.

1320
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:30,999
OK.

1321
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:34,920
For instance we wanted Baylor in Texas,
but Baylor already had a social network on campus so...

1322
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,439
...instead of going right after them, we made
a list of every school within a hundred miles.

1323
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:39,999
Put TheFacebook on
those campuses first.

1324
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,319
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were seeing
their friends on our site and we were in.

1325
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:43,719
It's called the little bighorn,
that's smart, Mark.

1326
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:45,078
Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1327
01:06:45,078 --> 01:06:46,958
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1328
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,119
I say it's time to start making
money from TheFacebook.

1329
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,319
But Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1330
01:06:51,998 --> 01:06:53,478
Err.. neither of you yet.

1331
01:06:54,238 --> 01:06:56,758
TheFacebook is cool, that's
what it's got going for it.

1332
01:06:57,078 --> 01:06:59,038
You don't want to ruin it with ads,
because ads aren't cool.

1333
01:06:59,038 --> 01:06:59,518
Exactly.

1334
01:06:59,637 --> 01:07:01,197
It's like you're throwing the
greatest party on campus...

1335
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:03,157
...and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11.

1336
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:06,077
You don't even know
what the thing is yet.

1337
01:07:06,158 --> 01:07:07,958
How big it can get,
how far it can go.

1338
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:09,837
This is no time to
take your chips down.

1339
01:07:09,837 --> 01:07:11,717
A million dollars isn't cool,
you know what's cool?

1340
01:07:11,717 --> 01:07:12,237
You?

1341
01:07:15,356 --> 01:07:17,116
A billion dollars.

1342
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:21,356
And that shut everybody up.

1343
01:07:21,756 --> 01:07:23,196
And that's where you're headed.

1344
01:07:23,196 --> 01:07:24,916
A billion dollar valuation.

1345
01:07:25,796 --> 01:07:30,515
Unless you take bad advice, in which case you may as well
have come up with a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1346
01:07:30,515 --> 01:07:32,555
When you go fishing you
can catch a lot of fish.

1347
01:07:32,555 --> 01:07:33,994
Or, you can catch a big fish.

1348
01:07:33,994 --> 01:07:37,395
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to fourteen trout?

1349
01:07:37,395 --> 01:07:38,915
No, he's holding a three
thousand pound marlin.

1350
01:07:38,915 --> 01:07:40,395
Yep.
- That's a good analogy.

1351
01:07:40,395 --> 01:07:42,835
OK, we all know that marlins don't
really weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

1352
01:07:42,835 --> 01:07:43,834
Have you seen the
big ones up close?

1353
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:46,554
No, I haven't. But I don't the guy's
holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1354
01:07:46,554 --> 01:07:49,154
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

1355
01:07:49,154 --> 01:07:50,794
You think you might be getting
away from the point?

1356
01:07:50,794 --> 01:07:54,714
I don't have a dog in this fight,
I'm just a fan and came to say hi.

1357
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:57,354
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1358
01:07:57,354 --> 01:08:00,114
He picked up the check, he told
Mark that they'd talk together soon...

1359
01:08:00,114 --> 01:08:04,793
..and he was gone, but not before he made
his biggest contribution to the company.

1360
01:08:07,152 --> 01:08:10,033
Drop the <i>The</i>, just <i>Facebook</i>. It's cleaner.

1361
01:08:25,312 --> 01:08:27,752
That's gotta be some kind of
landspeed record for talking.

1362
01:08:28,111 --> 01:08:29,671
You want to end the party at 11.

1363
01:08:30,751 --> 01:08:31,751
I'm trying to pay for the party.

1364
01:08:31,751 --> 01:08:32,631
There won't be a party...

1365
01:08:32,951 --> 01:08:33,791
...unless it's cool.

1366
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,591
What do you think?

1367
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:38,151
<i>Yeah sure, lets drop the The.</i>

1368
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:40,591
I meant catching the marlin
instead of the fourteen trout.

1369
01:08:41,191 --> 01:08:42,071
Doesn't that sound good?

1370
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:43,671
If you're a trout.

1371
01:08:44,351 --> 01:08:47,710
I'm going to enter this into the record,
incorporation papers for Facebook...

1372
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:48,950
...an LLC registered in Florida.

1373
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:50,270
Why Florida?

1374
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:51,590
It's where my family lives.

1375
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,350
And ask the respondents to stipulate that the articles
of incorporation state the ownership as follows:

1376
01:08:55,350 --> 01:09:01,190
65% for Mark Zuckerberg, 30% for Eduardo
Saverin, and 5% for Dustin Moskovitch.

1377
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:02,149
We stipulate -

1378
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:04,269
...and that was April 13, 2004.

1379
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:04,909
You can mark it.

1380
01:09:05,029 --> 01:09:06,148
Do you have anything here?

1381
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:07,629
Yes, thank you.

1382
01:09:07,909 --> 01:09:13,749
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything that might
be considered legitimate grounds for termination?

1383
01:09:15,269 --> 01:09:15,908
No.

1384
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:20,308
You never did anything to embarrass
the company, or even seriously jeopardize it?

1385
01:09:21,068 --> 01:09:22,028
No.
- No?

1386
01:09:26,267 --> 01:09:26,868
No!

1387
01:09:26,868 --> 01:09:28,508
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1388
01:09:32,307 --> 01:09:32,867
You weren't?

1389
01:09:33,867 --> 01:09:34,707
This is not happening.

1390
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:36,907
I have here an article
from <i>The Crimson.</i>

1391
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:38,307
Jesus Christ.

1392
01:09:38,426 --> 01:09:39,787
I can't have this, Eduardo.

1393
01:09:39,787 --> 01:09:43,107
Oh, come on man, this is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1394
01:09:44,427 --> 01:09:46,186
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1395
01:09:46,627 --> 01:09:50,026
I'd been accepted, and as part of
my initiation I had to, for one week...

1396
01:09:50,706 --> 01:09:55,665
...carry with me at all times,
and take care of, a chicken.

1397
01:09:55,665 --> 01:09:57,945
They identify you as one of the founders
of Facebook, Jr Eduardo Saverin.

1398
01:09:57,945 --> 01:10:00,265
I'm not the expert, but being connected to
torturing animals is probably bad for business.

1399
01:10:00,265 --> 01:10:04,465
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens.

1400
01:10:04,465 --> 01:10:05,465
Are you crazy?

1401
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:06,745
No, and settle down, please.

1402
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:08,944
I have here an article from <i>The Crimson...</i>

1403
01:10:08,944 --> 01:10:09,744
This is scathing.

1404
01:10:09,744 --> 01:10:10,705
956.

1405
01:10:10,705 --> 01:10:13,304
I was having dinner in the
Kirkland dining hall, with Mark...

1406
01:10:13,304 --> 01:10:17,624
...and I had the chicken with me because I had
to have the chicken with me at all times.

1407
01:10:17,624 --> 01:10:18,465
This was college.

1408
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:19,904
Somebody is going to
have to answer for this.

1409
01:10:19,904 --> 01:10:20,664
969.

1410
01:10:20,664 --> 01:10:25,143
The dining hall was serving chicken
for dinner, and I had to feed my chicken...

1411
01:10:25,143 --> 01:10:28,983
So.. I... well, I took little pieces of
chicken, and I gave it to the chicken.

1412
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:33,023
Someone must have seen because the next thing
I knew, I was accused of forced cannibalism.

1413
01:10:33,224 --> 01:10:34,303
I didn't know...

1414
01:10:34,423 --> 01:10:35,463
...you couldn't do that.

1415
01:10:35,584 --> 01:10:38,062
I dealt with the various
animal rights groups.

1416
01:10:38,062 --> 01:10:40,382
I dealt with the associate
dean at the college.

1417
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:42,022
This was all resolved.

1418
01:10:42,262 --> 01:10:43,062
988.

1419
01:10:43,062 --> 01:10:47,542
Someone from the Porc or the Fly must have
reported it, for all I know it was the Winklevosses.

1420
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:48,783
Alright, let's just forget about it.

1421
01:10:48,783 --> 01:10:49,742
This is absurd.

1422
01:10:49,862 --> 01:10:51,902
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1423
01:10:51,902 --> 01:10:53,542
lt's better to be
accused of necrophilia.

1424
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:54,742
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

1425
01:10:54,742 --> 01:10:58,021
I'm gonna have to explain this to my father,
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1426
01:10:58,541 --> 01:10:59,861
What is happening on that?

1427
01:10:59,861 --> 01:11:02,582
<i>I have my final coming up for Post War and
Contemporary Art and I haven't been to class.</i>

1428
01:11:02,582 --> 01:11:04,381
I'm supposed to write
about those four paintings.

1429
01:11:04,381 --> 01:11:05,701
That's a Facebook page?

1430
01:11:05,701 --> 01:11:06,901
Yeah. I opened it
up under an alias.

1431
01:11:06,901 --> 01:11:11,181
I posted the paintings and asked people to comment. Every
once in a while I hop on and stir the pot to get a debate going.

1432
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:13,820
Mr. Zuckerberg was
cheating on his final exam?

1433
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,420
I'd rather not answer that question.

1434
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,220
And why not?

1435
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:18,860
Cause I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1436
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,700
That's not what friends do.

1437
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:22,540
Well, you just told
us he was cheating.

1438
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:24,340
Oops.

1439
01:11:26,259 --> 01:11:28,539
You told your lawyer I
was torturing animals.

1440
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:32,619
No he didn't tell us about it at all, our litigators
are capable of finding a Crimson article.

1441
01:11:32,739 --> 01:11:35,059
In fact, when we raised the
subject, he defended you.

1442
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:38,299
Oops.

1443
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:41,419
993, we are so close.

1444
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:43,259
Oh yeah, that reminds me...

1445
01:11:43,898 --> 01:11:45,018
We're gonna need
more money, Eduardo.

1446
01:11:45,098 --> 01:11:46,538
I agree, more servers, more help.

1447
01:11:46,657 --> 01:11:49,898
I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto,
and we are going to have to pay them something

1448
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:50,578
Sorry, what?

1449
01:11:50,618 --> 01:11:54,658
I already found a house for rent on a street two blocks from
the Stanford campus. It's perfect and it's got a pool.

1450
01:11:54,658 --> 01:11:56,578
When did you decide to go
to California for the summer?

1451
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,057
You mean, when did I actually decide?

1452
01:11:58,057 --> 01:12:00,577
Somewhere in the middle of the
Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1453
01:12:01,457 --> 01:12:03,736
He was right, California is
the place we've gotta be.

1454
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,177
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1455
01:12:05,177 --> 01:12:07,297
Didn't know you guys have the
Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil?

1456
01:12:09,017 --> 01:12:10,377
What is your problem with Sean?

1457
01:12:10,496 --> 01:12:12,176
He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1458
01:12:12,176 --> 01:12:14,256
He doesn't have money,
Dustin's a better programmer.

1459
01:12:14,616 --> 01:12:15,856
He's got connections to VC's.

1460
01:12:15,856 --> 01:12:18,655
We need advertisers. And
I have connections to VC's.

1461
01:12:18,655 --> 01:12:22,176
They're real players, and as someone who's just
really embarrassed the company in a bad way -

1462
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:23,456
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.

1463
01:12:23,456 --> 01:12:24,936
Hang on.
Hit refresh.

1464
01:12:26,295 --> 01:12:28,495
150,000.

1465
01:12:29,535 --> 01:12:31,535
150,000 members.

1466
01:12:31,535 --> 01:12:32,175
Eduardo.

1467
01:12:32,175 --> 01:12:33,654
Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1468
01:12:34,174 --> 01:12:38,015
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

1469
01:12:38,015 --> 01:12:39,255
Who came up with nothing.

1470
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:41,655
Enough to get him out of the
company. The drugs, the girls.

1471
01:12:41,655 --> 01:12:42,815
We don't know if any of that's true.

1472
01:12:42,815 --> 01:12:43,414
Read about it.

1473
01:12:43,414 --> 01:12:45,694
And I can read about you torturing birds,
since when does reading about something -

1474
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:49,053
Do fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1475
01:12:51,413 --> 01:12:52,134
What's he talking about?

1476
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:56,614
I'm interviewing interns at 10 tomorrow night in the
CS lab. Get on board with this man, you know.

1477
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58,054
I don't really know
what else to say.

1478
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:32,851
What's going on?

1479
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:38,650
They have 10 minutes to get root access to a python webserver,
expose its SSL encryption, then intercept all traffic over its secure port.

1480
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:39,410
They're hacking.

1481
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,491
All behind a Pix Firewall Simulator,
but here's the beauty.

1482
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:43,290
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1483
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:44,490
I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1484
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:46,410
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to take a shot.

1485
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:51,049
And hacking is supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server
detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to take a shot.

1486
01:13:51,049 --> 01:13:54,729
I also have a program running that has a pop-up window
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

1487
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:56,450
The last candidate to hit
the window has to drink a shot.

1488
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:58,650
Plus every three minutes,
they all have to drink a shot.

1489
01:13:58,730 --> 01:13:59,889
Three minutes!

1490
01:14:01,649 --> 01:14:04,489
Can I ask what part of the interns job
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1491
01:14:05,129 --> 01:14:08,448
You're right. A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1492
01:14:10,688 --> 01:14:11,529
That was mean.

1493
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:13,489
Here.
- What is this?

1494
01:14:13,769 --> 01:14:16,608
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1495
01:14:18,128 --> 01:14:20,287
Will that get you through the summer?

1496
01:14:27,448 --> 01:14:28,368
Welcome to Facebook.

1497
01:14:38,367 --> 01:14:39,766
$18,000?
- Yes.

1498
01:14:40,046 --> 01:14:42,446
In addition to the $1,000
you already put up.

1499
01:14:42,446 --> 01:14:42,726
Yes.

1500
01:14:42,847 --> 01:14:45,487
A total of $19,000, now.
- Yes.

1501
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:46,646
Hang on.

1502
01:14:48,126 --> 01:14:49,686
Just checking your math on that.

1503
01:14:49,766 --> 01:14:50,445
Yes.

1504
01:14:51,245 --> 01:14:52,405
I got the same thing.

1505
01:14:52,726 --> 01:14:53,685
May I continue?

1506
01:14:54,085 --> 01:14:58,165
After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg
taking the company and moving it to California...

1507
01:14:58,165 --> 01:15:01,926
...for the summer, why did you put
$18,000 in an account for his use?

1508
01:15:01,926 --> 01:15:03,365
I figured we were partners.

1509
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,285
I wanted to be a team player.

1510
01:15:05,405 --> 01:15:10,964
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on
the site, while I was generating advertiser interest in New York.

1511
01:15:11,084 --> 01:15:12,244
But mostly I figured...

1512
01:15:12,764 --> 01:15:15,405
...how much could possibly
go wrong in three months?

1513
01:15:23,164 --> 01:15:25,283
I didn't die.
- I know.

1514
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,363
OK, ready?

1515
01:15:29,523 --> 01:15:30,163
That looks like an eight.

1516
01:15:30,603 --> 01:15:31,324
That was like a two.

1517
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,043
He was better than that.
- Yeah.

1518
01:15:42,202 --> 01:15:43,082
I'm OK.

1519
01:15:43,162 --> 01:15:44,802
You sure?
- Yeah.

1520
01:15:44,802 --> 01:15:48,082
Yikes
- That's the doorbell.

1521
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:50,162
I didn't know we
had a doorbell.

1522
01:15:50,282 --> 01:15:51,362
Andrew, get the door.

1523
01:15:51,362 --> 01:15:52,362
No, he's wired in.

1524
01:15:52,482 --> 01:15:54,722
That's gonna cut into
his security deposit.

1525
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:58,161
Andrew.
- Not now.

1526
01:15:58,161 --> 01:15:59,041
Good boy.

1527
01:16:03,321 --> 01:16:04,361
Sean?
- Mark.

1528
01:16:04,441 --> 01:16:06,441
Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1529
01:16:06,921 --> 01:16:08,920
We live right across the
street, we saw the chimney.

1530
01:16:09,241 --> 01:16:12,000
Is anybody hurt?
- You live across the street.

1531
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,199
I'm Sharon.

1532
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:16,679
This is my... Sharon,
she lives across the street...

1533
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:17,880
...I was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney.

1534
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,920
Yeah, we had a
zip-line to the pool.

1535
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,879
You came to California.

1536
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:25,839
You made the right choice.

1537
01:16:40,798 --> 01:16:42,078
I'm so sorry.

1538
01:16:42,078 --> 01:16:42,438
No problem.

1539
01:16:42,438 --> 01:16:43,078
I didn't know you
were gonna...

1540
01:16:43,518 --> 01:16:43,998
No wait...

1541
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:50,559
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1542
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:53,518
I'm Sean Parker.
- Oh, he's wired in.

1543
01:16:53,918 --> 01:16:55,397
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1544
01:16:57,077 --> 01:16:58,198
Where's Eduardo?

1545
01:16:58,318 --> 01:17:00,517
He got an internship in New York.

1546
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,797
Eduardo didn't come out.

1547
01:17:22,516 --> 01:17:26,195
I was crashing there for a little bit
while taking care of some things, but...

1548
01:17:26,195 --> 01:17:28,795
...she's done for the summer, so
she's back at her parents' place.

1549
01:17:28,795 --> 01:17:30,795
The homeless rockstar Palo Alto.
- Alright...

1550
01:17:32,195 --> 01:17:33,434
What's your plan
for the summer?

1551
01:17:37,595 --> 01:17:39,075
I'm sorry, I was looking
at the architecture.

1552
01:17:40,635 --> 01:17:41,754
I asked what your
plans for the -

1553
01:17:41,754 --> 01:17:43,235
A hundred schools by
the end of the summer.

1554
01:17:43,355 --> 01:17:44,795
- We're going to the restroom.
- OK.

1555
01:17:44,874 --> 01:17:45,754
I'll go with you.

1556
01:17:50,153 --> 01:17:52,313
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1557
01:17:52,313 --> 01:17:53,514
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1558
01:17:53,514 --> 01:17:54,714
What do you mean?

1559
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:59,793
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie...

1560
01:17:59,793 --> 01:18:02,433
...but he's too embarrassed to shop
for it in a department store.

1561
01:18:02,433 --> 01:18:06,793
Comes up with an idea for a high end
place that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1562
01:18:06,793 --> 01:18:11,112
He gets a $40,000 dollar bank loan,
borrows another $40,000 from his in-laws...

1563
01:18:11,112 --> 01:18:13,952
...opens a store and calls
it Victoria's Secret.

1564
01:18:13,952 --> 01:18:16,511
Makes half a million
dollars in the first year.

1565
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:23,431
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores and after five years,
he sells the company to Leslie Wester for four million dollars.

1566
01:18:23,992 --> 01:18:25,112
Happy ending, right?

1567
01:18:25,711 --> 01:18:32,391
Except, two years later the company is worth $500 mln
and Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge.

1568
01:18:34,991 --> 01:18:38,830
The poor guy just wanted to buy
his wife a pair of thigh highs.

1569
01:18:39,831 --> 01:18:41,191
Was that a parable?

1570
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:44,670
My date's a Victoria Secret model,
that's why she looks familiar to you.

1571
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:48,670
Don't be impressed by
all this, I read your blog.

1572
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:50,790
Oh no, that was for...
- Cretins.

1573
01:18:50,869 --> 01:18:52,509
You know why I started Napster?

1574
01:18:53,069 --> 01:18:57,669
The girl I loved in High School was with
the co-captain of the varsity Lacrosse team.

1575
01:18:57,870 --> 01:18:59,829
And I wanted to take her from him.

1576
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:02,029
So I decided to come
up with the next big thing.

1577
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:02,909
I didn't know that.

1578
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:08,068
Napster wasn't a failure. I changed the
music industry for better and for always.

1579
01:19:08,068 --> 01:19:11,869
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1580
01:19:11,869 --> 01:19:14,628
And isn't that what your
Facemash was about?

1581
01:19:14,628 --> 01:19:17,628
They're sacred of me pal, and
they're gonna be scared of you.

1582
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:21,708
What the VC's want to say, <i>good idea kid,
grown-ups are gonna take it from here.</i>

1583
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,627
But not this time,
this is our time.

1584
01:19:24,787 --> 01:19:30,547
This time you gonna hand them a
business card that says <i>I'm CEO, bitch.</i>

1585
01:19:30,827 --> 01:19:32,627
That's what I want for you.

1586
01:19:33,947 --> 01:19:35,147
So were the hell is Eduardo?

1587
01:19:36,707 --> 01:19:39,266
He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1588
01:19:39,586 --> 01:19:40,586
He's got an internship.

1589
01:19:41,586 --> 01:19:45,466
The company's here, a
billion dollar company's here.

1590
01:19:46,146 --> 01:19:48,026
Do you live and breathe Facebook?

1591
01:19:48,226 --> 01:19:49,106
I know you do.

1592
01:19:49,226 --> 01:19:52,506
Eduardo wants to be a business man
and for all I know he'll be a good one, but...

1593
01:19:52,506 --> 01:19:55,665
...he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1594
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:59,825
This is a once in a generation
holy shit idea...

1595
01:19:59,825 --> 01:20:04,025
...and the water under the
Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1596
01:20:05,145 --> 01:20:08,824
Look at my face and tell me I
don't know what I'm talking about.

1597
01:20:11,424 --> 01:20:12,623
You ever think about that girl?

1598
01:20:12,623 --> 01:20:13,143
What girl?

1599
01:20:13,943 --> 01:20:16,984
T-the girl from high school,
the Lacrosse team.

1600
01:20:18,344 --> 01:20:19,184
No.

1601
01:20:19,264 --> 01:20:20,783
You guys need to top up.

1602
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:24,104
A hundred schools by
the end of the summer?

1603
01:20:24,823 --> 01:20:30,383
Tell you what, a gesture of faith. You get into
hundred schools, I'll put you on two continents.

1604
01:20:37,703 --> 01:20:41,582
If you don't have a place to crash I think
you should definitely come live with us.

1605
01:20:41,822 --> 01:20:44,822
Let's line up some shots.
Excuse me.

1606
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,222
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942?

1607
01:20:49,342 --> 01:20:51,102
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1608
01:22:41,614 --> 01:22:42,934
Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1609
01:22:42,934 --> 01:22:44,854
Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1610
01:22:44,054 --> 01:22:45,814
This is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1611
01:22:47,293 --> 01:22:51,333
His Royal Highness Prince Albert. Your
highness, this is Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

1612
01:22:51,453 --> 01:22:53,014
Of course. Brilliant race.

1613
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:54,533
I've never seen
a race that close.

1614
01:22:54,973 --> 01:22:57,333
My grandfather Jack Kelly
was one of the premier rowers.

1615
01:22:58,293 --> 01:23:01,973
I've been coming to Henley for thirty years,
and I've never seen a race that close.

1616
01:23:01,973 --> 01:23:03,693
Have you seen a race that close?

1617
01:23:04,852 --> 01:23:07,292
No, Your Highness. A mile and a half races are
more commonly won by a boat-length or two.

1618
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:09,093
Yes, that's absolutely right.

1619
01:23:09,093 --> 01:23:10,092
Brutally close.

1620
01:23:10,092 --> 01:23:11,093
May I introduce my team mates?

1621
01:23:11,093 --> 01:23:13,052
I'm sorry, you have to excuse us.

1622
01:23:17,731 --> 01:23:19,531
So we flew all the way
out here to see that?

1623
01:23:19,531 --> 01:23:20,611
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.

1624
01:23:20,611 --> 01:23:21,531
How's the royalty?

1625
01:23:21,531 --> 01:23:24,292
Ah, he just wanted to tell me a couple
of times how close the race was.

1626
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:26,852
Brutally close, brutally
excruciating... Jezus.

1627
01:23:26,852 --> 01:23:30,811
Cam, the guy's the prince of a country
the size of a Kentucky pie, it's fine.

1628
01:23:31,771 --> 01:23:33,611
Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1629
01:23:33,611 --> 01:23:35,291
I'm sorry dad, you and Mom
had to fly all the way to see this.

1630
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,810
No son, don't ever apologize to
me for losing a race like that.

1631
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:40,451
I never apologized to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1632
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:42,651
Mr. Kenright.

1633
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,570
Dad, this is Mr. Kenright, head
of the host family this week.

1634
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:47,050
Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1635
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:49,209
I just had a fine chat
with my daughter.

1636
01:23:49,209 --> 01:23:51,689
She told me she and her friends
were already talking about the race...

1637
01:23:51,689 --> 01:23:53,649
...which they've just
seen by their computers.

1638
01:23:53,649 --> 01:23:55,329
A new website called Facebook.

1639
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:57,050
Do you have this in America?

1640
01:23:59,049 --> 01:23:59,849
I'm gonna find your mother.

1641
01:24:02,888 --> 01:24:04,048
I said something wrong?

1642
01:24:04,048 --> 01:24:05,408
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States.

1643
01:24:05,408 --> 01:24:08,248
No, no. Cambridge, majoring
in French literature.

1644
01:24:08,248 --> 01:24:09,648
Though I wasn't aware
there was such a thing.

1645
01:24:09,648 --> 01:24:10,768
They have Facebook at Cambridge?

1646
01:24:10,768 --> 01:24:13,128
And apparently Oxford, and the
London School of Economics.

1647
01:24:13,128 --> 01:24:14,968
That's where her friends are.
- That's awesome.

1648
01:24:16,168 --> 01:24:19,487
Good race boys. Take the
bitter with the better, eh?

1649
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,007
You watch my stuff.

1650
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,287
This is online, I want to see it.

1651
01:24:28,488 --> 01:24:29,528
Stop it.

1652
01:24:32,327 --> 01:24:32,926
Knock it off.

1653
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:36,806
I don't mind that we lost to the
Dutch by less than a second...

1654
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:37,766
...that was a good race...

1655
01:24:37,766 --> 01:24:40,246
...and that was a fair race,
and they'll see us again.

1656
01:24:40,246 --> 01:24:42,846
What I mind and what
you should mind...

1657
01:24:42,846 --> 01:24:45,526
...is showing up on Monday for a
race that was run on Sunday.

1658
01:24:46,326 --> 01:24:48,926
We tried talking to him ourselves, we tried
writing a letter, we'd tried the Ad board...

1659
01:24:48,926 --> 01:24:51,685
...and we tried talking to
the president of the university.

1660
01:24:51,685 --> 01:24:53,645
Now I am asking you
for the last time...

1661
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:58,886
...let's take the considerable resources at
our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1662
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:00,365
Come on.

1663
01:25:02,164 --> 01:25:03,084
I need a real drink.

1664
01:25:10,804 --> 01:25:11,284
Screw it.

1665
01:25:12,764 --> 01:25:14,685
Lets gut the friggin' nerd.

1666
01:25:18,204 --> 01:25:19,484
It's what I'm talkin' about.

1667
01:25:20,924 --> 01:25:23,124
Check it out, I saw him today.

1668
01:25:23,163 --> 01:25:26,043
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy. Hang on.

1669
01:25:26,603 --> 01:25:28,562
Are you guys using
spikes or ghostesses?

1670
01:25:28,562 --> 01:25:30,243
We don't know, we're just
shooting at each other.

1671
01:25:30,243 --> 01:25:31,563
Use sweet kamikazes.

1672
01:25:31,683 --> 01:25:32,803
Like we know what that is?

1673
01:25:33,923 --> 01:25:37,242
I saw him getting into his Turbo
Carrera and he saw me too.

1674
01:25:37,562 --> 01:25:38,722
I know he did.

1675
01:25:41,562 --> 01:25:44,481
Don't, don't sweat it.

1676
01:25:44,561 --> 01:25:45,721
Bong hit.

1677
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,042
Does anybody hear that banging?

1678
01:25:48,162 --> 01:25:50,002
You don't hear anything,
you're writing code.

1679
01:25:50,642 --> 01:25:52,001
Somebody's at the door.

1680
01:25:52,401 --> 01:25:54,881
It's not a dish best
served cold...

1681
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:57,401
...it's a dish served immediately
and relentlessly.

1682
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:01,880
I'm gonna call you back.

1683
01:26:04,361 --> 01:26:05,041
What's up?

1684
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:05,760
What's up?

1685
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,560
Mark was supposed to pick me up at the
airport an hour ago. I've been calling his cell.

1686
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,199
He was on a 36 hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a few hours.

1687
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:23,040
What happened here?

1688
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,120
Not happened, happening.

1689
01:26:25,239 --> 01:26:26,599
Next big thing.

1690
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:27,639
Eduardo.

1691
01:26:28,118 --> 01:26:29,678
Hey man, back to work.

1692
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:33,158
Sorry about it, It's the more wasted I get..

1693
01:26:33,558 --> 01:26:34,959
I meant the more...

1694
01:26:35,159 --> 01:26:36,518
We understand.

1695
01:26:39,238 --> 01:26:40,158
How old are they, Sean?

1696
01:26:40,758 --> 01:26:41,878
It's not polite to ask.

1697
01:26:41,998 --> 01:26:42,598
Sean, how old are they?

1698
01:26:44,518 --> 01:26:45,757
You think you know me, right?

1699
01:26:45,798 --> 01:26:46,517
I've read enough.

1700
01:26:46,637 --> 01:26:48,437
You know how much I've read about you?

1701
01:26:54,917 --> 01:26:55,397
Eduardo.

1702
01:26:55,397 --> 01:26:58,237
I waited an hour for you at the airport.

1703
01:26:58,237 --> 01:26:59,637
What time is it?

1704
01:26:59,637 --> 01:27:01,956
Midnight, it's 3 A.M. in New York
where I just came from.

1705
01:27:03,156 --> 01:27:04,956
You got to see some
of the new stuff we got.

1706
01:27:04,956 --> 01:27:07,437
Dustin, show him the wall,
I'm just calling it the wall.

1707
01:27:07,476 --> 01:27:09,836
Forget about the wall, tell him
about the meeting I got set up.

1708
01:27:10,076 --> 01:27:11,276
You know Peter Thiel?

1709
01:27:11,716 --> 01:27:12,316
Nope.

1710
01:27:12,316 --> 01:27:16,155
No reason you should. He just runs a two billion
dollar hedge fund called Clarium Capital.

1711
01:27:17,595 --> 01:27:18,875
Why is he setting up
meetings for you?

1712
01:27:18,915 --> 01:27:19,995
Thiel may want to make
an angel investment

1713
01:27:19,995 --> 01:27:22,755
I don't care if he's an actual angel,
why is he setting up business meetings?

1714
01:27:23,275 --> 01:27:23,955
You've had a long flight.

1715
01:27:23,955 --> 01:27:28,155
No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK, then a long
wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO.

1716
01:27:28,155 --> 01:27:29,714
And in between there
was a long flight.

1717
01:27:30,075 --> 01:27:31,594
I'm the business end
of this company.

1718
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:34,834
And he is a house guest
living here rent-free...

1719
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:37,955
...on a very generous grant from
the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1720
01:27:37,955 --> 01:27:40,835
I heard about your big ticket Big
Daddy Big Buys, Gary's Tuxedos -

1721
01:27:40,835 --> 01:27:41,194
Hey, man.

1722
01:27:41,194 --> 01:27:45,553
Harvard Bartending Course, you're just a small step
away from bagging Snookies Cookies. Can feel it.

1723
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:55,793
Can I talk to you
alone for a minute?

1724
01:27:55,793 --> 01:27:56,193
Sure.

1725
01:28:00,952 --> 01:28:02,272
Uh, bong hit.

1726
01:28:02,392 --> 01:28:03,832
I'm so high.

1727
01:28:05,432 --> 01:28:08,712
How's it going? How's the
internship, how's Christy?

1728
01:28:10,593 --> 01:28:11,592
How's the internship?

1729
01:28:14,272 --> 01:28:18,791
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship, we talked
about this on the phone. I quit on my first day.

1730
01:28:20,311 --> 01:28:21,911
I do remember
you saying that.

1731
01:28:22,391 --> 01:28:23,271
So how's Christy?

1732
01:28:24,791 --> 01:28:25,791
Christy's crazy.

1733
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:27,391
Is that fun?

1734
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:27,911
No.

1735
01:28:28,351 --> 01:28:32,630
Psychotic, she's insanely
jealous, she's irrational.

1736
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,750
And I'm frightened of her.

1737
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:36,830
Still it's nice you
have a girlfriend.

1738
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:41,230
I do not want that guy...

1739
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:43,830
...representing himself
as part of this company.

1740
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:45,829
You've got move out here Eduardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1741
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:46,229
Did you here what I just said?

1742
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:47,829
The connections, the energy.

1743
01:28:47,829 --> 01:28:48,390
Mark, Mark.

1744
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:51,029
I'm afraid if you don't come out
here, you're going to be left behind.

1745
01:28:51,149 --> 01:28:53,909
I want, I want, I need you,
please don't tell me -

1746
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:55,668
What did you just say?

1747
01:28:55,788 --> 01:28:57,949
It's moving faster than any of
us ever imagined it would.

1748
01:28:57,949 --> 01:29:00,349
It's moving fast and Sean
thinks that we should -

1749
01:29:00,349 --> 01:29:01,189
Sean's not part of this company.

1750
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:03,509
We have over 300,000 members,
we're in hundred-sixty schools.

1751
01:29:03,509 --> 01:29:04,988
- I'm aware of that.
- Including five in Europe.

1752
01:29:04,988 --> 01:29:05,948
I'm aware of that.

1753
01:29:05,948 --> 01:29:07,588
MARK, I'm the CFO.

1754
01:29:07,588 --> 01:29:10,228
We need more programmers, and we need
more money, and he set up the Thiel meeting.

1755
01:29:10,228 --> 01:29:11,788
He set up meetings all over town.

1756
01:29:12,108 --> 01:29:13,108
Set up other meetings...
- Yes.

1757
01:29:13,108 --> 01:29:14,468
Without me knowing
anything about it.

1758
01:29:14,468 --> 01:29:14,828
- You're in New York.

1759
01:29:14,828 --> 01:29:18,668
I'm in New York riding subways fourteen
hours a day, trying to find advertisers.

1760
01:29:18,668 --> 01:29:20,787
Yeah, and how is
it going so far?

1761
01:29:24,426 --> 01:29:26,027
What did you mean,
get left behind?

1762
01:29:32,347 --> 01:29:37,865
I'd like to freeze this bank account and
cancel all existing checks and lines of credit.

1763
01:29:38,905 --> 01:29:40,105
May I see some ID, please.

1764
01:29:40,105 --> 01:29:40,826
Yeah, sure.

1765
01:29:47,985 --> 01:29:50,825
Sean, he'll be right with you.
- No problem.

1766
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:55,224
You know this is where they
filmed Towering Inferno?

1767
01:29:55,344 --> 01:29:56,185
That's comforting.

1768
01:29:58,344 --> 01:29:59,865
Hey guys, come on back.

1769
01:30:01,305 --> 01:30:02,305
Did she offer you some waters?

1770
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:03,784
Oh yeah, we're cool.

1771
01:30:05,944 --> 01:30:07,024
You must be Mark.

1772
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:13,503
We took a look at everything
and congratulations.

1773
01:30:13,503 --> 01:30:17,104
We're gonna start you off with
a $500,000 investment.

1774
01:30:17,104 --> 01:30:20,183
Maurice is going to talk to you about
some corporate restructuring.

1775
01:30:20,983 --> 01:30:22,743
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware.

1776
01:30:22,743 --> 01:30:25,023
We've come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1777
01:30:25,343 --> 01:30:27,822
Now let me ask you something...

1778
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:30,222
...who's Eduardo Saverin?

1779
01:30:49,262 --> 01:30:50,501
Jesus Christ.

1780
01:30:53,661 --> 01:30:54,781
When did you get back?

1781
01:30:54,861 --> 01:30:56,421
You scared me, I
need you to knock.

1782
01:30:56,421 --> 01:30:58,500
When did you get back?

1783
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,900
I got back this afternoon.

1784
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,060
And when were
you gonna call me?

1785
01:31:02,741 --> 01:31:04,661
Chris. it was kind of a rough trip...

1786
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:05,821
...and I was tired.

1787
01:31:05,821 --> 01:31:09,300
Or answer one of my 47 texts,
did you know I sent 47 texts?

1788
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,100
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

1789
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:14,380
Are you mocking me?

1790
01:31:14,499 --> 01:31:15,899
I brought you a present.

1791
01:31:17,339 --> 01:31:19,420
Why does your status say <i>single</i>
on your Facebook page?

1792
01:31:19,899 --> 01:31:20,779
What?

1793
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:25,499
Why does your relationship status say
<i>single</i> on your Facebook page?

1794
01:31:25,499 --> 01:31:27,179
I was single when I set up the page.

1795
01:31:27,179 --> 01:31:28,938
And you just never
bothered to change it?

1796
01:31:29,139 --> 01:31:30,138
What?

1797
01:31:30,179 --> 01:31:31,298
I don't know how.

1798
01:31:31,858 --> 01:31:33,298
Do I look stupid to you?

1799
01:31:33,858 --> 01:31:34,939
No, calm down.

1800
01:31:34,939 --> 01:31:39,858
You're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook doesn't
know how to change his relationship status on Facebook?

1801
01:31:39,858 --> 01:31:40,578
A little embarrassing...

1802
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:42,818
...so you should take it as a sign
of trust that I would tell you that.

1803
01:31:42,818 --> 01:31:44,057
Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1804
01:31:44,097 --> 01:31:47,217
You didn't change it, so you could screw
those Silicon Valley sluts every time you go -

1805
01:31:47,217 --> 01:31:50,098
That's not even remotely true and
I can promise you that the Silicon Valley...

1806
01:31:50,098 --> 01:31:53,257
...sluts don't care what anyone's
relationship status is on Facebook.

1807
01:31:53,657 --> 01:31:55,457
Please open your present.

1808
01:31:55,737 --> 01:31:56,857
Your phone does work.

1809
01:31:58,176 --> 01:31:59,096
It's Mark.

1810
01:31:59,417 --> 01:32:01,976
This is going to be tricky.
Uh, open your present.

1811
01:32:02,376 --> 01:32:03,456
It's a silk scarf.

1812
01:32:03,735 --> 01:32:05,856
Have you ever seen
me wear a scarf?

1813
01:32:05,856 --> 01:32:07,296
This will be your first.

1814
01:32:08,336 --> 01:32:08,776
Yeah.

1815
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:10,416
You froze our account?
- I did.

1816
01:32:10,496 --> 01:32:11,416
You froze the account.

1817
01:32:11,495 --> 01:32:12,456
I had to get your
attention, Mark.

1818
01:32:12,456 --> 01:32:15,855
Do you realize you jeopardize the entire company? Do
you realize your actions could've permanently destroy...

1819
01:32:15,855 --> 01:32:16,935
...everything I've been working on?

1820
01:32:16,935 --> 01:32:17,975
WE have been working on.

1821
01:32:17,975 --> 01:32:19,175
Without money the
site can't function.

1822
01:32:19,175 --> 01:32:21,576
Let me tell you the difference between
Facebook and everybody else.

1823
01:32:21,576 --> 01:32:22,695
We don't crash ever.

1824
01:32:22,695 --> 01:32:26,295
If the servers are down for even a day
our reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1825
01:32:26,295 --> 01:32:26,615
Look -

1826
01:32:26,615 --> 01:32:30,534
Napster and Friendster have proven that. Even a few people
leaving would reverberate through the entire user base.

1827
01:32:30,534 --> 01:32:33,014
The users are interconnected,
that's the whole point.

1828
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:38,015
College kids are online because their friends are online, and
if one domino goes, the other dominoes go, don't you get that?

1829
01:32:38,015 --> 01:32:40,734
I am not going back to the
Caribbean night at A.E.Pi.

1830
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:42,973
Holy shit.

1831
01:32:46,133 --> 01:32:47,093
What is wrong with you?

1832
01:32:47,093 --> 01:32:50,253
Did you like being nobody? Did you like
being a joke? You want to go back to that?

1833
01:32:50,253 --> 01:32:51,053
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1834
01:32:51,053 --> 01:32:53,613
That was the act of a
child, not a businessman.

1835
01:32:53,613 --> 01:32:55,253
Certainly not the act of a friend.

1836
01:32:55,253 --> 01:32:58,653
You know how embarrassed I was to cash
a check today? I am not going back to that life.

1837
01:32:58,653 --> 01:33:00,133
Maybe you were frustrated.
- Yeah.

1838
01:33:00,773 --> 01:33:01,852
Maybe you were angry.

1839
01:33:01,852 --> 01:33:03,212
I was.

1840
01:33:03,492 --> 01:33:07,971
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,
because Eduardo, I've got some good news,

1841
01:33:08,091 --> 01:33:12,612
I'm sorry, I was angry
and maybe it was childish.

1842
01:33:12,612 --> 01:33:14,171
But I had to get your attention.

1843
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:16,531
I said I've got
some good news

1844
01:33:17,851 --> 01:33:18,412
What is it?

1845
01:33:18,412 --> 01:33:21,010
Peter Thiel just made an angel
investment of half a million dollars.

1846
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:23,291
Half a million dollars.

1847
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:26,171
And he's setting us up in an office.

1848
01:33:26,171 --> 01:33:27,731
They want to re-incorporate the company.

1849
01:33:27,731 --> 01:33:30,850
They want to meet you, they need
your signature on some documents.

1850
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:35,810
So you need to get your ass on the first
flight back to San Francisco. I need my CFO.

1851
01:33:39,689 --> 01:33:40,650
I'm on my way.

1852
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:41,650
Eduardo.
- Yeah.

1853
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:42,890
We did it.

1854
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:47,130
Eduardo.

1855
01:33:48,369 --> 01:33:49,689
You're going back there already?

1856
01:33:50,169 --> 01:33:50,929
Yes.

1857
01:33:53,049 --> 01:33:55,169
Also I'm breaking up with you.

1858
01:34:02,968 --> 01:34:05,527
Four documents. The first two are
common stock agreement purchases...

1859
01:34:05,527 --> 01:34:11,088
...allowing you to buy stock in the newly
re-incorporated Facebook, as opposed to the old shares...

1860
01:34:11,088 --> 01:34:12,048
...which are now worthless.

1861
01:34:12,048 --> 01:34:16,167
The third is an exchange agreement allowing
you to exchange the old shares for new shares.

1862
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:18,448
And finally the voter holding agreement.

1863
01:34:18,448 --> 01:34:20,287
How many shares of stock will I own?

1864
01:34:20,407 --> 01:34:23,966
1,328,334
- Jesus Christ.

1865
01:34:24,046 --> 01:34:27,807
That represents 34.4% ownership share.

1866
01:34:27,807 --> 01:34:30,367
Why the increase from
the original thirty percent?

1867
01:34:30,367 --> 01:34:33,806
Because you may dilute
to award shares to new investors.

1868
01:34:33,646 --> 01:34:36,086
I love working with business majors.
- Intelligent.

1869
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:41,645
You should know that Mark has already taken
his percentage from sixty down to fifty-one.

1870
01:34:43,085 --> 01:34:45,726
Well, Mark doesn't care about
money and he needs to be protected.

1871
01:34:48,206 --> 01:34:53,085
Dustin Moskovitch owns 6.81 percent,
Sean Parker 6.47 percent.

1872
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:56,324
I can live with that.

1873
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:58,084
And Peter Thiel seven percent.

1874
01:35:01,765 --> 01:35:03,564
Would you like to use my pen?

1875
01:35:05,084 --> 01:35:05,964
Eduardo?

1876
01:35:07,124 --> 01:35:07,724
Eduardo.

1877
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,443
Can you please repeat the question?

1878
01:35:10,563 --> 01:35:13,683
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time and now you want us to hear it twice?

1879
01:35:13,683 --> 01:35:15,563
Yes, we do.
Read it back, please.

1880
01:35:15,963 --> 01:35:16,404
Go ahead.

1881
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:20,724
Counsel, when you signed these documents, were you
aware you were signing your own death certificate?

1882
01:35:20,724 --> 01:35:21,603
No.

1883
01:35:26,523 --> 01:35:30,282
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all these...

1884
01:35:30,682 --> 01:35:33,363
In all honesty, I thought
they were my lawyers.

1885
01:35:36,882 --> 01:35:37,802
I was your only friend.

1886
01:35:40,321 --> 01:35:41,361
You had one friend.

1887
01:35:45,921 --> 01:35:46,802
My father won't even look at me.

1888
01:35:46,881 --> 01:35:51,361
OK. Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say anything
to you after you had signed the papers?

1889
01:35:52,281 --> 01:35:54,920
There was a lot of hand shaking,
a lot of congratulations.

1890
01:35:55,921 --> 01:35:59,520
He'd already told me he wouldn't be coming
back to school for at least a semester.

1891
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,319
So we were saying goodbye for a while.

1892
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,800
Before I left he said:
- But you gotta come back.

1893
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:08,080
Somewhere around the end of
November, early December...

1894
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,999
...Peter wants to throw us an amazing
party when we hit a million members.

1895
01:36:10,999 --> 01:36:13,879
It's gonna be out of control,
you gotta come back for it.

1896
01:36:13,879 --> 01:36:14,839
A million members?

1897
01:36:15,759 --> 01:36:18,078
Remember the algorithm?
On the window at Kirkland.

1898
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:25,639
Yeah, I'll be here.

1899
01:36:30,518 --> 01:36:31,638
You sure about this?

1900
01:36:31,758 --> 01:36:32,878
You're twenty minutes late.

1901
01:36:32,918 --> 01:36:35,799
You're gonna walk in there, say you overslept
and you didn't have time to get dressed.

1902
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:39,437
Their gonna pitch you. Case Equities is going
pitch you, Their gonna beg you take their money.

1903
01:36:39,437 --> 01:36:41,838
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod...

1904
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:45,477
...and then you're gonna say: which one of you
is Steve Roth? No, not Roth. Manningham.

1905
01:36:45,757 --> 01:36:46,637
Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?

1906
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:47,797
And he'll say, I am.

1907
01:36:47,877 --> 01:36:51,597
And then you say, <i>Sean
Parker says Fuck You.</i>

1908
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:52,477
And walk out.

1909
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:53,437
OK.

1910
01:37:06,116 --> 01:37:10,515
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark telling
me to come out for the millionth member party.

1911
01:37:10,596 --> 01:37:12,195
What else did the e-mail say?

1912
01:37:12,195 --> 01:37:14,555
It said that we had to
have a business meeting.

1913
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:18,075
That Mark and Sean had played some
kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity.

1914
01:37:18,715 --> 01:37:23,315
And that Manningham was so impressed he was now
making an investment offer that was hard to turn down.

1915
01:37:23,995 --> 01:37:27,155
So I went to California and I
went straight to the new offices.

1916
01:37:28,514 --> 01:37:31,994
I didn't know whether to dress for
the party or the business meeting...

1917
01:37:32,114 --> 01:37:33,394
...so I kinda dressed for both.

1918
01:37:35,194 --> 01:37:36,074
But it didn't matter.

1919
01:37:36,313 --> 01:37:36,994
Why not?

1920
01:37:37,113 --> 01:37:39,034
Because I wasn't called
out there for either one.

1921
01:37:39,154 --> 01:37:40,554
What were you
called out there for?

1922
01:37:44,394 --> 01:37:45,353
An ambush.

1923
01:37:45,993 --> 01:37:47,353
Mr. Saverin, please.

1924
01:37:58,552 --> 01:38:01,232
At first I thought he was joking.

1925
01:38:01,432 --> 01:38:03,072
Giving more contracts to sign.

1926
01:38:07,071 --> 01:38:08,671
But then I started reading.

1927
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:12,511
What is this?

1928
01:38:14,111 --> 01:38:17,431
Well, as you know we
had some new investors that -

1929
01:38:17,431 --> 01:38:18,391
What is this?

1930
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:34,350
Mark.

1931
01:38:36,150 --> 01:38:36,709
Mark.

1932
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:37,590
He's wired in.
- Sorry?

1933
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:38,549
He's wired in.

1934
01:38:38,549 --> 01:38:39,429
Is he?
- Yes.

1935
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:43,110
How about now, you still wired in?
- Call security.

1936
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:46,469
You issued twenty-four million
new shares of stock.

1937
01:38:47,189 --> 01:38:49,029
You were told that if
new investors came along -

1938
01:38:49,429 --> 01:38:51,549
How much were your shares
diluted? How much were his?

1939
01:38:51,549 --> 01:38:54,428
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
shares diluted down to?

1940
01:38:56,189 --> 01:38:57,028
It wasn't.

1941
01:38:57,269 --> 01:39:00,148
What were Mr. Moscovitz's
ownership shares diluted down to?

1942
01:39:00,869 --> 01:39:01,269
It wasn't.

1943
01:39:01,628 --> 01:39:04,267
What were Sean Parker's
shares diluted down to?

1944
01:39:05,068 --> 01:39:05,707
It wasn't.

1945
01:39:06,028 --> 01:39:08,628
What were Peters Thiels ownership
shares diluted down to?

1946
01:39:08,987 --> 01:39:09,548
It wasn't.

1947
01:39:09,828 --> 01:39:12,708
And what was your ownership
shares diluted down to?

1948
01:39:13,828 --> 01:39:15,748
.03 percent.

1949
01:39:23,866 --> 01:39:24,827
You signed the papers.

1950
01:39:24,866 --> 01:39:25,786
You set me up.

1951
01:39:25,786 --> 01:39:30,147
You're gonna blame because you were the business head of the
company, and you made a bad business deal with your own company.

1952
01:39:30,466 --> 01:39:32,186
It's gonna be like I'm
not a part of Facebook.

1953
01:39:32,186 --> 01:39:34,306
Won't be like you're not a part of Facebook,
you're not a part of Facebook.

1954
01:39:34,306 --> 01:39:35,426
My name's on the masthead.

1955
01:39:35,546 --> 01:39:36,546
You may want to check again.

1956
01:39:36,826 --> 01:39:38,185
Because I froze the account?

1957
01:39:38,185 --> 01:39:41,705
You think we were gonna let you parade around in your
ridiculous suits and pretending you were running this company.

1958
01:39:41,705 --> 01:39:43,786
Sorry, my Prada's are at the cleaners.

1959
01:39:43,786 --> 01:39:46,145
Along with my hoodie and
fuck-you flip flops.

1960
01:39:46,145 --> 01:39:48,225
You pretentious douchebag.

1961
01:39:48,225 --> 01:39:49,505
Security's here, you'll be leaving now.

1962
01:39:49,505 --> 01:39:51,745
I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

1963
01:39:52,304 --> 01:39:55,184
Tell me this isn't about
me getting into the Phoenix.

1964
01:39:58,704 --> 01:40:01,384
I knew you did it, you planted
that story about the chicken.

1965
01:40:01,384 --> 01:40:03,025
I didn't plant the story
about the chicken.

1966
01:40:03,025 --> 01:40:03,624
What's he talking about?

1967
01:40:03,624 --> 01:40:05,064
You had me accused of animal cruelty.

1968
01:40:05,064 --> 01:40:06,224
Seriously, what the hell's the chicken?

1969
01:40:06,224 --> 01:40:11,663
What you hated most, was that they
identified me as a co-founder of Facebook.

1970
01:40:11,663 --> 01:40:12,583
Which I am.

1971
01:40:12,583 --> 01:40:14,343
You better lawyer up, asshole.

1972
01:40:14,343 --> 01:40:19,543
Cause I'm not coming back for thirty percent,
I'm coming back for everything.

1973
01:40:24,743 --> 01:40:27,142
Get him out of here.
- It's OK, I'm going.

1974
01:40:29,581 --> 01:40:30,022
Hang on.

1975
01:40:32,783 --> 01:40:33,582
Almost forgot.

1976
01:40:35,702 --> 01:40:39,301
Here's your $19,000. I wouldn't cash it
though, I drew it on the account you froze.

1977
01:40:44,261 --> 01:40:46,101
I like standing next to you, Sean.

1978
01:40:47,981 --> 01:40:49,061
Makes me look so tough.

1979
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:06,260
That's it, that's our
show for tonight, people.

1980
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:11,100
I want to see everyone here geared up for
a party. We're going to walk into that club...

1981
01:41:11,179 --> 01:41:15,138
...like it's the Macy's parade, Mackie, put it up
on the big screen, we've gotta almost be there.

1982
01:41:17,778 --> 01:41:18,619
You alright?

1983
01:41:20,619 --> 01:41:22,259
You were kinda rough with him.

1984
01:41:22,459 --> 01:41:23,579
That's life in the NFL.

1985
01:41:24,259 --> 01:41:25,819
You know you didn't have
to be that rough on him.

1986
01:41:26,178 --> 01:41:27,298
I'm putting together a party.

1987
01:41:27,298 --> 01:41:27,858
Sean.

1988
01:41:29,497 --> 01:41:31,457
You didn't have to be
that rough on him.

1989
01:41:31,457 --> 01:41:32,777
He almost killed it.

1990
01:41:34,898 --> 01:41:35,778
I'll send flowers.

1991
01:41:38,018 --> 01:41:41,177
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting
together a party after the party...

1992
01:41:41,457 --> 01:41:42,457
...at Kappa Beta Sigma.

1993
01:41:42,818 --> 01:41:43,897
Ash is a sister.

1994
01:41:44,257 --> 01:41:45,217
Ashley.
- The intern.

1995
01:41:46,336 --> 01:41:47,337
I know who she is.

1996
01:41:48,176 --> 01:41:48,816
Are you guys..

1997
01:41:48,897 --> 01:41:51,737
Ashley? Me? No.
Well, a little bit.

1998
01:41:53,217 --> 01:41:53,976
Why?

1999
01:41:54,616 --> 01:41:55,617
Excuse me, Mark.

2000
01:41:56,137 --> 01:41:57,536
We were just talking about you.

2001
01:41:57,577 --> 01:41:59,216
Just that you're doing
a really good job.

2002
01:41:59,776 --> 01:42:01,456
Thanks, I appreciate that.

2003
01:42:03,015 --> 01:42:04,375
These came in for you.

2004
01:42:04,416 --> 01:42:05,375
Put them on my desk.

2005
01:42:12,056 --> 01:42:13,055
What's the package?

2006
01:42:14,135 --> 01:42:14,975
Nothing.

2007
01:42:17,534 --> 01:42:18,054
Mackie.

2008
01:42:18,574 --> 01:42:20,254
Yes, sir.
- Refresh.

2009
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:29,574
And you're not a hugger.

2010
01:42:30,214 --> 01:42:30,734
I know.

2011
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:34,814
One million.

2012
01:42:37,133 --> 01:42:38,374
Who's got champagne?

2013
01:42:40,774 --> 01:42:42,214
I've got champagne.

2014
01:43:01,532 --> 01:43:07,611
The next transformative development of picture sharing application,
a place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life.

2015
01:43:07,971 --> 01:43:11,131
It is the true, the digitalization of your life.

2016
01:43:13,132 --> 01:43:15,051
You don't just go to a party anymore...

2017
01:43:15,131 --> 01:43:19,211
...you go to a party with a digital camera
and then your friends re-live the party online.

2018
01:43:19,211 --> 01:43:20,931
And tagging, the idea -

2019
01:43:20,931 --> 01:43:22,050
Would it be easier without the bra?

2020
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:41,450
I spend hours watching what people do when they
log on. How they check their friends status updates.

2021
01:43:41,529 --> 01:43:42,689
That's weird, why did the music stop?

2022
01:43:42,689 --> 01:43:46,049
To see which one of their friends change
their profiles, change their photos and mostly-

2023
01:43:46,049 --> 01:43:47,129
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2024
01:43:47,409 --> 01:43:51,408
We lived on farms. And then we lived in
cities, and now were going to live on the internet.

2025
01:43:52,848 --> 01:43:55,008
Stop. I think something's
going on downstairs.

2026
01:44:13,088 --> 01:44:13,927
It's the cops.

2027
01:44:19,647 --> 01:44:21,806
Good to see you officer,
what can I do for you?

2028
01:44:23,206 --> 01:44:23,726
What's going on?

2029
01:44:24,326 --> 01:44:26,565
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2030
01:44:26,565 --> 01:44:27,927
Miss, I need you
to button your blouse.

2031
01:44:28,047 --> 01:44:29,767
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2032
01:44:34,605 --> 01:44:35,245
Not mine.

2033
01:44:35,726 --> 01:44:37,445
OK, we're going to need identification.

2034
01:44:37,565 --> 01:44:39,005
Keep your hands where
we can see them.

2035
01:44:40,045 --> 01:44:42,325
You got anything else in your
pockets I should know about?

2036
01:44:42,325 --> 01:44:43,205
No, no, sir.

2037
01:44:43,205 --> 01:44:45,326
Don't be stupid now.
- I don't, I don't.

2038
01:44:50,004 --> 01:44:50,845
What's this?

2039
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:52,685
That's an EpiPen.

2040
01:44:54,004 --> 01:44:55,684
And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2041
01:44:57,363 --> 01:44:57,844
How old are you?

2042
01:44:59,724 --> 01:45:00,325
21.

2043
01:45:01,684 --> 01:45:02,164
21.

2044
01:45:02,524 --> 01:45:03,284
21.

2045
01:45:03,284 --> 01:45:04,044
I'm 21.

2046
01:45:04,044 --> 01:45:05,324
Lying makes it worse.

2047
01:45:06,804 --> 01:45:08,403
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2048
01:45:20,883 --> 01:45:23,722
- Listen, something has happened.

2049
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:30,842
Shit.

2050
01:45:30,882 --> 01:45:32,882
- It's alright, it's gonna be alright.

2051
01:45:33,162 --> 01:45:37,801
I posted bond, I wasn't doing
anything. I mean I've got allergies.

2052
01:45:42,001 --> 01:45:42,680
Interns.

2053
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,681
It was just a party.

2054
01:45:47,201 --> 01:45:50,081
This is gonna be news Sean,
it's gonna be online any second.

2055
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,360
- I know.
You know with an intern.

2056
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,520
It's cool, I have it under control.

2057
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:57,720
I will get it under control.

2058
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:00,919
I will call someone and see
what the next move is...

2059
01:46:00,919 --> 01:46:02,359
...but this is gonna
be news now.

2060
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:04,360
You don't think Eduardo
was involved, do you?

2061
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:06,999
You think?
- No.

2062
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:12,319
Or Manningham. One of them, somebody
sent the coke 'cause it got in there.

2063
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:14,599
You believe me?
This is gonna be fine.

2064
01:46:18,839 --> 01:46:19,319
Right?

2065
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:24,199
Go home, Sean.

2066
01:46:42,397 --> 01:46:43,037
Mark?

2067
01:46:45,277 --> 01:46:46,837
We're done for the day.

2068
01:46:48,556 --> 01:46:49,837
Yeah, I was just sitting here.

2069
01:46:53,197 --> 01:46:54,237
What happened to Sean?

2070
01:46:55,436 --> 01:46:57,556
He still owns seven
percent of the company.

2071
01:47:01,155 --> 01:47:04,355
All you had all day was that salad.
You want get something to eat?

2072
01:47:05,435 --> 01:47:06,756
I can't.

2073
01:47:14,275 --> 01:47:15,435
I'm not a bad guy.

2074
01:47:15,555 --> 01:47:16,435
I know that.

2075
01:47:17,275 --> 01:47:20,954
And there's an emotional testimony.
I assume 85 percent of it is exaggeration.

2076
01:47:21,354 --> 01:47:23,195
And the other fifteen?
- Perjury.

2077
01:47:23,995 --> 01:47:25,474
Creation miss need a devil.
- Perjury.

2078
01:47:28,514 --> 01:47:29,434
What happens now?

2079
01:47:30,834 --> 01:47:34,913
Sy and the others are having
a steak on university avenue.

2080
01:47:35,473 --> 01:47:39,433
Then they'll come back to the office and
work on a settlement deal to present to you.

2081
01:47:40,193 --> 01:47:41,633
They're gonna settle.
- Oh yeah.

2082
01:47:42,193 --> 01:47:43,993
And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.

2083
01:47:44,113 --> 01:47:44,473
Why?

2084
01:47:44,753 --> 01:47:47,273
So that these guys sign
a non-disclosure agreement.

2085
01:47:47,393 --> 01:47:50,552
They say one unflattering word about you in
public and you own their wife and kids.

2086
01:47:50,552 --> 01:47:53,593
I invented Facebook.
- I'm talking about a jury.

2087
01:47:53,913 --> 01:47:56,473
I specialize in <i>voir dire</i>
jury selection.

2088
01:47:56,473 --> 01:47:58,712
What a jury sees when
they look at a defendant.

2089
01:47:58,832 --> 01:48:02,192
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likability.
- Likability.

2090
01:48:02,192 --> 01:48:05,631
- I've been licensed to practice
law for all of twenty months and...

2091
01:48:05,631 --> 01:48:09,272
...I could get a jury to believe you planted
the story about Eduardo and the chicken.

2092
01:48:09,552 --> 01:48:10,472
Watch what else:

2093
01:48:10,992 --> 01:48:13,111
Why weren't you at Sean's
sorority party that night?

2094
01:48:13,831 --> 01:48:15,311
You think I'm the one who
called the police on him?

2095
01:48:15,311 --> 01:48:17,350
Doesn't matter. I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

2096
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:20,510
You've lost your jury
in the first ten minutes.

2097
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:23,470
Farm animals.
- Yeah.

2098
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:27,230
I was drunk, and
angry, and stupid.

2099
01:48:27,230 --> 01:48:29,990
And blogging.
- And blogging.

2100
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:31,310
Pay them.

2101
01:48:32,229 --> 01:48:34,869
In the scheme of things,
it's a speeding ticket.

2102
01:48:36,989 --> 01:48:38,229
That's what Sy
will tell you tomorrow.

2103
01:48:38,989 --> 01:48:41,549
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2104
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:43,829
I can imagine it would be a problem.
- Thanks.

2105
01:48:46,149 --> 01:48:47,309
I appreciate your
help today.

2106
01:48:51,908 --> 01:48:53,668
You're not an
asshole, Mark.

2107
01:48:55,547 --> 01:48:57,148
You're just trying so hard to be.
